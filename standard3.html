	<div class="content"><p>From the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the Age of Discovery, and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the Great Divergence, a term coined by Samuel Huntington[58] the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.</p><h3>Modern era[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg/170px-Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg" width="170" height="206"><br><p>The United States Constitution</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg/170px-Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg" width="170" height="135"><br><p>La Liberté guidant le Peuple by French painter Eugène Delacroix</p><p>Coming into the modern era, the historical understanding of the East-West contrast—as the opposition of Christendom to its geographical neighbors—began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The Age of Discovery faded into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the Catholic Church; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism.</p><p>Philosophers of the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Voltaire (1694–1778), David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.[59] influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as enlightened absolutism. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by Voltaire spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the scientific revolution, spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of modern science, during which developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.[60][61][62][63][64][65] While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution, and its completion is attributed to the grand synthesis of Newton's 1687 Principia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools.[66] These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.[67]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/220px-Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>A Watt steam engine. The steam engine, made of iron and fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world.[68]</p><p>The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[69][70][71] The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[72][73][74][75] GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,[76] while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.[77] Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants[78] and fire.</p><p>The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories.[79][80][81]</p><h2>Arts and humanities[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg/220px-Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg" width="220" height="243"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry showing William the Conqueror (centre), his half-brothers Robert, Count of Mortain (right) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux in the Duchy of Normandy (left). The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque.</p><p>Some cultural and artistic modalities are characteristically Western in origin and form. While dance, music, visual art, story-telling, and architecture are human universals, they are expressed in the West in certain characteristic ways.</p><p>In Western dance, music, plays and other arts, the performers are only very infrequently masked. There are essentially no taboos against depicting a god, or other religious figures, in a representational fashion.</p><h3>Music[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg/180px-Beethoven.jpg" width="180" height="216"><br><p>Ludwig van Beethoven composed many Masses and religious works, including his Ninth Symphony Ode to Joy.</p><p>In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,[82] and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.[83]</p><p>The symphony, concerto, sonata, opera, and oratorio have their origins in Italy. Many important musical instruments used by cultures all over the world were also developed in the West; among them are the violin, piano, pipe organ, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, accordion, and the theremin. The solo piano, symphony orchestra, and the string quartet are also important performing musical forms.</p><p>Many forms of popular music have been derived from African-Americans, and their innovations of jazz and blues serve as the basis from which much of modern popular music derives. Folklore and music during 19th and 20th centuries, initially by themselves, but later played and further developed together with White and Black Americans, British people, and Westerners in general. These include jazz, blues and rock music (that in a wider sense include the rock and roll and heavy metal genres), rhythm and blues, funk, hip hop, techno as well as the ska and reggae genres from Jamaica. Several other related or derived styles were developed and introduced by Western pop culture such as pop and dance music.</p><h3>Painting and photography[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Attributed_to_Jan_van_Eyck%2C_Netherlandish_%28active_Bruges%29%2C_c._1395_-_1441_-_Saint_Francis_of_Assisi_Receiving_the_Stigmata_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Attributed_to_Jan_van_Eyck%2C_Netherlandish_%28active_Bruges%29%2C_c._1395_-_1441_-_Saint_Francis_of_Assisi_Receiving_the_Stigmata_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="189"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata, attributed to Jan van Eyck, from 1430 until 1432</p><p>Jan van Eyck, among other renaissance painters, made great advances in oil painting, and perspective drawings and paintings had their earliest practitioners in Florence.[84] In art, the Celtic knot is a very distinctive Western repeated motif. Depictions of the nude human male and female in photography, painting, and sculpture are frequently considered to have special artistic merit. Realistic portraiture is especially valued.</p><p>Photography, and the motion picture as both a technology and basis for entirely new art forms were also developed in the West.</p><h3>Dance and performing arts[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Swanlake001.jpg/170px-Swanlake001.jpg" width="170" height="227"><br><p>Classical music, opera and ballet. Swan lake pictured (here, Zenaida Yanowsky as Odette)</p><p>The ballet is a distinctively Western form of performance dance.[85] The ballroom dance is an important Western variety of dance for the elite. The polka, the square dance, and the Irish step dance are very well known Western forms of folk dance.</p><p>The soap opera, a popular culture dramatic form, originated in the United States first on radio in the 1930s, then a couple of decades later on television. The music video was also developed in the West in the middle of the 20th century.</p><h3>Literature[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Dante_Alighieri_-_Inferno_-_Plate_9_%28Canto_III_-_Charon%29.jpg/220px-Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Dante_Alighieri_-_Inferno_-_Plate_9_%28Canto_III_-_Charon%29.jpg" width="220" height="303"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The Divine Comedy is an epic poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work in Italian literature,[86] and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.[87] The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. In this scene, Charon comes to ferry souls across the river Acheron to the Christian Hell. Engraving by Gustave Doré</p><p>While epic literary works in verse such as the Mahabharata and Homer's Iliad are ancient and occurred worldwide, the prose novel as a distinct form of storytelling, with developed, consistent human characters and, typically, some connected overall plot (although both of these characteristics have sometimes been modified and played with in later times), was popularized by the West[88] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the Hellenistic world and in Heian Japan. Both Petronius' Satyricon (c. 60 CE) and the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.</p><p>Tragedy, from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical opera.</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg/260px-Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg" width="260" height="260"><br><p>Rayonnant rose window in Notre Dame de Paris. In Gothic architecture, light was considered the most beautiful revelation of God.</p><p>Important Western architectural motifs include the Doric, Corinthian, and Ionic columns, and the Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque, and Victorian styles are still widely recognised, and used even today, in the West. Much of Western architecture emphasizes repetition of simple motifs, straight lines and expansive, undecorated planes. A modern ubiquitous architectural form that emphasizes this characteristic is the skyscraper, first developed in New York, London, and Chicago.[citation needed]</p><h2>Scientific and technological inventions and discoveries[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Woman_teaching_geometry.jpg/220px-Woman_teaching_geometry.jpg" width="220" height="243"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Medieval Christians believed that to seek the geometric, physical and mathematical principles that govern the world was to seek and worship God.

In the Middle Ages, it is unusual to see women represented as teachers, in particular when the students appear to be monks.

The scientific method as a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses was almost entirely fashioned by the Italian Galileo Galilei.[90][91]</p><p>The Western World has been the leading force in the technological and scientific disciplines: whether measured in people or events, 97 percent of accomplishment in the scientific inventories occurred in Europe and North America. The Dictionary of Scientific Biography (DoSB) sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies, concluded that Eighty-one percent of the most significant scientists and mathematicians come from Europe compared to 76 percent in the Human Accomplishment set, numbers that rise to 94 and 91 percent respectively when the United States and Canada are included.[92] The United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy alone account for 72 percent of all the significant scientific figures in science from 1400 to 1950. Add in Russia and the Netherlands, and 80 percent of all significant figures are accounted for.[93]</p><p>By the will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel the Nobel Prize were established in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[94] The percentage of ethnically European noble prize winners during the first and second halves of the 20th century were respectively 98 and 94 percent.[95] A study by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) - Japan's equivalent of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) concluded that 54% of the world's most important inventions were British. Of the rest, 25% were American and 5% Japanese.[96]</p><p>It was the West that first developed steam power and adapted its use into factories, and for the generation of electric power.[97][98] The electrical motor, dynamo, transformer, and electric light, and indeed most of the familiar electrical appliances, were inventions of the West.[99][100][101][102] The Otto and the Diesel internal combustion engines are products whose genesis and early development were in the West.[103][104] Nuclear power stations are derived from the first atomic pile constructed in Chicago in 1942.[105]</p><p>Communication devices and systems including the telegraph, the telephone, radio, television, communications and navigation satellites, mobile phone, and the Internet were all invented by Westerners.[106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] The pencil, ballpoint pen, Cathode ray tube, liquid-crystal display, light-emitting diode, camera, photocopier, laser printer, ink jet printer, plasma display screen and world wide web were also invented in the West.[114][115][116][117][118][119]</p><p>Ubiquitous materials including concrete, aluminium, clear glass, synthetic rubber, synthetic diamond and the plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene were invented in the West. Iron and steel ships, bridges and skyscrapers first appeared in the West. Nitrogen fixation and petrochemicals were invented by Westerners. Most of the elements, were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary atomic theories to explain them.[citation needed]</p><p>The transistor, integrated circuit, memory chip, and computer were all first seen in the West. The ship's chronometer, the screw propeller, the locomotive, bicycle, automobile, and airplane were all invented in the West. Eyeglasses, the telescope, the microscope and electron microscope, all the varieties of chromatography, protein and DNA sequencing, computerised tomography, Nuclear magnetic resonance, x-rays, and light, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories.[citation needed]</p><p>In medicine, the pure antibiotics were created in the West. The method of preventing Rh disease, the treatment of diabetes, and the germ theory of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of smallpox, was led by a Westerner, Donald Henderson. Radiography, Computed tomography, Positron emission tomography and Medical ultrasonography are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of clinical chemistry including the methods of spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay were first devised by Westerners. So were the stethoscope, electrocardiograph, and the endoscope. Vitamins, hormonal contraception, hormones, insulin, Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, along with a host of other medically proven drugs were first utilized to treat disease in the West. The double-blind study and evidence-based medicine are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In mathematics, calculus, statistics, logic, vectors, tensors and complex analysis, group theory and topology were developed by Westerners.[120][121][122][123][124][125][126] In biology, evolution, chromosomes, DNA, genetics and the methods of molecular biology are creatures of the West. In physics, the science of mechanics and quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics were all developed by Westerners. The discoveries and inventions by Westerners in electromagnetism include Coulomb's law (1785), the first battery (1800), the unity of electricity and magnetism (1820), Biot–Savart law (1820), Ohm's Law (1827), and the Maxwell's equations (1871). The atom, nucleus, electron, neutron and proton were all unveiled by Westerners.[citation needed]</p><p>In business, economics, and finance, double entry bookkeeping, credit card, and the charge card were all first used in the West.[127][128]</p><p>Westerners are also known for their explorations of the globe and outer space. The first expedition to circumnavigate the Earth (1522) was by Westerners, as well as the first journey to the South Pole (1911), and the first moon landing (1969).[129][130] The landing of robots on Mars (2004 and 2012) and on an asteroid (2001), the Voyager 2 explorations of the outer planets (Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989), Voyager 1's passage into interstellar space (2013), and New Horizons' flyby of Pluto (2015) were significant recent Western achievements.[131][132][133][134][135]</p><h2>Media[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Western media</p><p>The Western media refers to the news media of the Western world. The roots of the Western media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when printing presses began to operate throughout Western Europe. The emergence of news media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press, from which the publishing press derives its name.[136]</p><p>In the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of Latin in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the discoveries arising from trade and travel, navigation to the new world, science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in Western Europe.[137]</p><p>After the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the U.S. launching Telstar in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in America in 1975.[138]</p><p>Beginning in the 1990s, the Internet has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages (magazines, CDs, television and radio slots), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items (articles, audio and video files).[139]</p><h2>Religion[edit]</h2><p>The native religions of Europe were polytheistic but not homogenous—however they were similar insofar as they were predominantly Indo-European in origin. Roman religion was similar to but not the same as Hellenic religion—likewise the same for indigenous Germanic polytheism, Celtic polytheism and Slavic polytheism. Western culture, for at least the last 1000 years, has been considered nearly synonymous with Christian culture.[140] Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards.</p><p>Western culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians. The notion of Europe and the Western World has been intimately connected with the concept of Christianity and Christendom many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.[17]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As in other areas, Judaism is found in the Western world. Minority groups, and Jews in particular, often had to contend with discrimination and persecution.

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at Athens in 1896.</p><p>The Romans built immense structures such as the Colisseum in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for blood sports, such as the infamous Gladiatorial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of Classical Antiquity—such as Greco-Roman wrestling, discus and javelin. The sport of bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice and is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its Central and South American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.</p><p>Jousting and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the Middle Ages, and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of the popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. The Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence—these include Ping Pong, modern tennis, Association Football, Netball and Rugby.</p><p>Football (also known as soccer) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the world game. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the Rugby World Cup has been shared among the Western nations of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.</p><p>Australian Rules Football, an Australian variation of football with similarities to Gaelic football and rugby evolved in the British colony of Victoria in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of baseball to America during the colonial period. The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Many games known as football were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, the Father of American Football. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. From these American origins, basketball has become one of the great international participation sports.</p><p>Professionalism in sport in the West became prevalent during the 20th Century, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet—all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.</p><h2>Themes and traditions[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg/220px-Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg" width="220" height="279"><br><p>A Madonna and Child painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas.</p><p>Western culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:[citation needed]</p><h3>Notes[edit]</h3><h3> [edit]</h3><br><img alt="Page semi-protected" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png" width="20" height="20"><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Africa</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square&nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4% of its total land area.[2] With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population.[1] The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.[3]</p><p>Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[4][5] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[6] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.[7] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.[8]</p><p>Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonised almost all of Africa. Africa also varies greatly with regard to environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. However, most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations have attempted to cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg/170px-Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg" width="170" height="228"><br><p>Statue representing Africa at Palazzo Ferreria, in Valletta, Malta</p><p>Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[9][10] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician ?afar 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis[11] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) cave, in reference to cave dwellers.[12] The same word[12] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[13]</p><p>Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[14] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, located in modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.</p><p>According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while Asia was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.</p><p>Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name Africa:</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Africa

Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0&nbsp;million years BP,[20] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4&nbsp;million years BP)[21] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9&nbsp;million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[2]</p><p>After the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[22][23][24] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[25][26] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[27] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[28]</p><p>Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[29]</p><p>The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[30] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[31] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[32] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.</p><p>The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[33] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.</p><p>Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[34] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[34]</p><p>By the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,[35] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[34]</p><h3>Early civilizations</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Ancient African history</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg/220px-Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt, date from around 1400 BC.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Bantu_expansion.png/170px-Bantu_expansion.png" width="170" height="180"><br><p>The origins and spread of the Bantu languages c. 1000 BC to c. 500 AD</p><p>At about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.[36] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[37][38] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[39]</p><p>An independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[40][41][42]</p><p>European exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans.[citation needed] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[43]</p><p>Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[44]</p><p>Christianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[45] by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[46]</p><p>In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Ninth to eighteenth centuries</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg/170px-Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg" width="170" height="234"><br><p>African horseman of Baguirmi in full padded armour suit</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG/170px-Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG" width="170" height="232"><br><p>The intricate 9th-century bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu, in Nigeria displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.[48]</p><p>Pre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[49] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.</p><p>By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.</p><p>In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu.

Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.</p><p>The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[51] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[52] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[53]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg/220px-Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg" width="220" height="132"><br><p>Ruins of Great Zimbabwe (eleventh to fifteenth centuries)</p><p>Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[54] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cedid_Atlas_%28Africa%29_1803.jpg/220px-Cedid_Atlas_%28Africa%29_1803.jpg" width="220" height="184"><br><p>1803 Cedid Atlas, showing the Africa from the perspective of the Ottoman Empire.

Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.[57][58][59] More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[60]</p><p>In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[61]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg/220px-The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg" width="220" height="166"><br><p>Slave being inspected, from Captain Canot; or, Twenty Years of an African Slaver</p><p>Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against the usurping King of Lagos, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[62] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[63]</p><h3>Colonialism and the Scramble for Africa</h3><p>Main article: Colonization of Africa

Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.</p><h3>Berlin Conference</h3><p>The Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.</p><h3>Independence struggles</h3><p>Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[64] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[65] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.</p><p>Portugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.</p><h3>Post-colonial Africa</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Mobutu_Sese_Seko_1973.jpg" width="140" height="186"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5 billion from his country.</p><p>Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.</p><p>Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/SADF-Operations_4.jpg/220px-SADF-Operations_4.jpg" width="220" height="177"><br><p>South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the South African Border War</p><p>Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund,[citation needed] also played a role in instability.

Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.[66][67][68] The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[69] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.</p><p>In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[70] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[71]</p><h2>Geography</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Geography of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/187_1003703_africa_dxm.png/220px-187_1003703_africa_dxm.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Satellite photo of Africa.

In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as sahel and steppe dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.[77] The record for the highest-ever recorded temperature, in Libya in 1922 (58&nbsp;°C (136&nbsp;°F)), was discredited in 2013.[78][79]</p><h3>Fauna</h3><p>Main article: Fauna of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Zebras%2C_Serengeti_savana_plains%2C_Tanzania.jpg/220px-Zebras%2C_Serengeti_savana_plains%2C_Tanzania.jpg" width="220" height="119"><br><p>Savanna at Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania</p><p>Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and range of freedom of wild animal populations and diversity, with wild populations of large carnivores (such as lions, hyenas, and cheetahs) and herbivores (such as buffalo, elephants, camels, and giraffes) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of jungle animals including snakes and primates and aquatic life such as crocodiles and amphibians.

Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.[77]</p><p>Deforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[80] According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.[77] Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.[81] Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.[82] About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.[83]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>See also: Afrotropic ecozone and Palearctic ecozone</p><h2>Politics</h2><p>See also: List of political parties in Africa by country</p><p>There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states.

Main article: African Union</p><p>The African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[84] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.</p><p>The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.</p><p>Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg/450px-Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg.png" width="450" height="405" usemap="#ImageMap_1_1093313515"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="The image above contains clickable links" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Interactive_icon.svg/18px-Interactive_icon.svg.png" title="The image above contains clickable links" width="18" height="27"><p>Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational African entities v • d • e</p><h2>Economy</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/RECs_of_the_AEC.svg/220px-RECs_of_the_AEC.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Map of the African Economic Community.

Main article: Economy of Africa
See also: Economy of the African Union and Water in Africa</p><p>Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[85] According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[86]</p><p>Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[87] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.[88]</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[89] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[90][91][92]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[93] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[94] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[95] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[96] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.[97]</p><p>In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[70]</p><p>A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.[98]</p><p>During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.[99]</p><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Main article: Demographics of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Kobli1.jpg/220px-Kobli1.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Woman from Benin</p><p>Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[100] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.[101] As of 2014, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.2 billion.[102] Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time - India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[103]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/San_tribesman.jpg/170px-San_tribesman.jpg" width="170" height="254"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>San Bushman man from Botswana</p><p>Speakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from The Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[104] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (San or Bushmen) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also San, closely related to, but distinct from Hottentots) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[105]</p><p>The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.</p><p>The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[106] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[citation needed]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bedscha.jpg/220px-Bedscha.jpg" width="220" height="196"><br><p>Beja bedouins from Northeast Africa</p><p>In the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.</p><p>Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[107] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[108] Kenya, Congo,[109] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[110] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[111] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa.[112] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[113] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[114]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[70] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[115]</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Main article: Languages of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg/170px-Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg" width="170" height="196"><br><p>Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa:

Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:</p><p>Following the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.</p><h2>Culture</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg/220px-Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The rock-hewn Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Main article: Culture of Africa</p><p>Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[118] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to civilize Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[118]</p><p>Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[119] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art. [120] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[120] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art. [121] In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.[122] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe. [123] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies. [124]</p><p>There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.</p><h3>Visual art and architecture</h3><p>African art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.[125] The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg/170px-Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg" width="170" height="340"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A musician from South Africa</p><h3>Music and dance</h3><p>Main article: Music of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg/170px-Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg" width="170" height="227"><br><p>The Namibia rugby team</p><p>Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.</p><h3>Sports</h3><p>Fifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.</p><p>Cricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p><h2>Religion</h2><p>Main article: Religion in Africa

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions. A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baha'i, or Jewish.

The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.</p><p>Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the region comprises more than 700 islands, islets, reefs and cays. (See the list.) These islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea.[5] The Caribbean islands, consisting of the Greater Antilles on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east (including the Leeward Antilles), are part of the somewhat larger West Indies grouping, which also includes the Lucayan Archipelago (comprising the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands) north of the Greater Antilles and Caribbean Sea. In a wider sense, the mainland countries of Belize, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana are often included due to their political and cultural ties with the region.[6]</p><p>Geopolitically, the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of North America[7][8][9][10][11] and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies. From December 15, 1954, to October 10, 2010, there was a country known as the Netherlands Antilles composed of five states, all of which were Dutch dependencies.[12] From January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was also a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then British dependencies. The West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology and pronunciation[edit]</h2><p>The region takes its name from that of the Caribs, an ethnic group present in the Lesser Antilles and parts of adjacent South America at the time of the Spanish conquest of America.[13]</p><p>The two most prevalent pronunciations of Caribbean are KARR-?-BEE-?n, with the primary accent on the third syllable, and k?-RIB-ee-?n, with the accent on the second. The former pronunciation is the older of the two, although the stressed-second-syllable variant has been established for over 75 years.[14] It has been suggested that speakers of British English prefer KARR-?-BEE-?n while North American speakers more typically use k?-RIB-ee-?n,[15] although not all sources agree.[16] Usage is split within Caribbean English itself.[17]</p><h2>Definition[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png/300px-CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png" width="300" height="207"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Map of the Caribbean</p><p>The word Caribbean has multiple uses.

<div class="content"><p> Further information: Evolution of microeconomics</p><p>Microeconomics (from Greek prefix mikro- meaning small) is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms.[1][2][3]</p><p>One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results.</p><p>Microeconomics stands in contrast to macroeconomics, which involves the sum total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment and with national policies relating to these issues.[2] Microeconomics also deals with the effects of economic policies (such as changing taxation levels) on the aforementioned aspects of the economy.[4] Particularly in the wake of the Lucas critique, much of modern macroeconomic theory has been built upon 'microfoundations'—i.e. based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Assumptions and definitions</h2><p>Microeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual. To economists, rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive. The technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function. Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable.</p><p>Microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set. It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no guarantee that a rational individual would maximize utility. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory. The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences. The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices but why individuals make choices as well.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is a constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. That is, since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed, a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence.</p><p>The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as the primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as the primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as Revealed preference theory.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg/220px-Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability at each price (supply) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand). The graph depicts a right-shift in demand from D1 to D2 along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new market-clearing equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).


		</p><p>
			The theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive. This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions.</p><p>Mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss. A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good. In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating missing markets to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed.</p><p>This is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory. Optimal welfare usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor–Hicks method. This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory.</p><p>The demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set.</p><p>
		Microeconomic theories are involved with the choices that households and firms make. Some of these microeconomic concepts include elasticity of demand and supply, market structures and utility. Microeconomic looks into the way individuals and businesses behave in coming up with decisions to do with the distribution of rare resources and collaborations between these individuals and the firm. A production possibility frontier illustrates the maximum probable output combinations of two services or goods an economy may realise while all other resources are efficiently and wholly engaged. A production possibility frontier is used to explain the models of opportunity cost, illustrate the effects of economic development and demonstrate the theory of trade-offs.</p><p>Supply and demand is possibly amongst the most crucial conceptions of economics and it is the pillar of the economy of a market. Demand can be explained as the extent to which a service or a good is desired by users. The amount demanded is the sum of a commodity individuals are ready to purchase at a certain given price. Supply on the other hand refers to how much of a product a market can provide. The supplied quantity is the volume of a particular commodity manufacturers are willing to supply at a certain price. The relationship between demand and supply trigger the forces as a result of the sharing of resources. The law of demand states that when all other influences stay constant the higher the price of a good, the lesser the demand of the given produce. In other word the greater the price the lower the amount needed. The amount of a good bought by customers at a greater price is lower as the price rises the opportunity cost of buying a commodity. People will therefore naturally evade buying a commodity that will need them to sacrifice the use of something else that is more significant to them. Similar to the law of demand, the law of supply reveals the amounts that will be traded at a certain given price. Contrasting the law of demand, the supply relationship gives a rising slope. This means that the bigger the price the greater the quantity in supply. Manufacturers supply more at a high price because selling a quantity at a higher price rises income. Where demand and supply are the same, the economy is held to be at equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium the distribution of goods is at its most effectual because the amount of goods at supply is precisely the same as the volume of goods in demand. Therefore every individual is contented with prevailing state of the economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Elasticity is defined as the degree of receptiveness in demand and supply in relation to fluctuations in price. If a curve is more elastic then lesser alterations in price will result to a higher change in quantity used up. If a curve is less elastic it will then cause higher deviations in price to affect a change in amount consumed. Price elasticity of demand is the extent of responsiveness in quantity demanded in relation to price. Utility on the other hand is the amount of contentment resulting from the consumption of a commodity or services at a particular period. Utility is a psychological satisfaction not inherent. It is dependent on the persons own subjective approximate of satisfaction to be acquired from the consumption of a commodity. Utility is further divided into marginal utility, total utility and maximizing utility. Marginal utility refers to the extra utility resulting from the consumption of one extra unit of a commodity, the consumption of the rest of the goods remaining unaffected. Total utility is refers to as the number of units of utility that a consumer gains from consuming a given quantity of a good, service, or activity during a particular time period. The greater a consumers total utility, the larger the customer’s level of consumption. The cost to any firm of producing any output evidently depends upon the physical amounts of real resources. For instance material, labour and machine hours used in production. As the larger output needs a larger amount of resources, the total cost for larger output becomes high. Whereas the smaller output requires the smaller resources. The total cost for smaller output becomes smaller. A company can produce at lower cost when it produces better new techniques to products. Production with traditional and old method implicates high cost. The maximisation of returns includes the use of a definite technique to produce that can facilitate the optimal combination of factors. Production cost is defined as the expenditures by a business in producing a commodity. There are several kinds of cost concepts, these are marginal cost, total cost and average cost. Total is the cost of producing a certain output of the product in question. Total cost can be classified into variable cost and fixed cost. Fixed costs is also known as overhead cost. These are costs which do not differ with output. The costs will be the same whether the output is ten or twenty or a thousand of a product. Fixed costs entails interest on bank loans, depreciation of machinery, insurance charges and rent of factory. Variable costs are also called prime cost. Variable costs differ with alterations in output. The greater the output, the bigger the variable costs. Average cost is the cost of each unit of output and is achieved by dividing the total cost by the level of output. It is further divided into two parts, average fixed cost and average variable cost. Marginal cost is defined as the extra cost incurred by increasing output by one unit. It is the added cost of producing an additional unit of output. Perfect competition is a market structure in which the following characteristics are met. All businesses trade the same commodity, all firms will have a comparatively small market share, all firms are price takers meaning they cannot control the market price of their goods, the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit, and buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm. Perfect competition is a hypothetical market structure. Under perfect competition there are numerous buyers and sellers and prices reveal supply and demand. Customers will have several substitutes when the commodity they wish to buy quality begins to reduce or if it becomes more expensive. News firms can as well simply enter the market, leading to an extra competition. Monopoly on the other hand is where there is only one supplier in the market. For the reasons of regulation, monopoly power occurs where a single business owns 25% or more of a particular market. Monopolies can form for a number of reasons. For example, government can grant a business monopoly powers, if a firm has exclusive ownership of a limited resource, producers may have patents over designs for instance, giving them rights to trade a good or a service and a merger of two or more firms would create a monopoly. Monopolies have basic characteristics such as, they can maintain super normal returns in the long run, a monopolist with no substitute would be able to develop the greatest monopoly power and with no close substitutes, the monopolist can therefore derive supernormal profits.</p><p>In conclusion, microeconomics tries in any way not to explain what ought to happen in a market. Instead it will explains what to anticipate if some conditions are altered. For instance if producers increase the price of a commodity, customers will opt to purchase fewer of a product than before.</p><h2>Topics</h2><p>The study of microeconomics involves several key areas:</p><h3>Demand, supply, and equilibrium</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Main article: Supply and demand</p><p>Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market. It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.</p><h3>Measurement of elasticities</h3><p> Main article: Elasticity (economics)</p><p>Elasticity is the measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another variable. Elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable, when the later variable has a causal influence on the former. It is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable, or of the function that determines it, to changes in causative variables in unitless ways. Frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.</p><h3>Consumer demand theory</h3><p> Main article: Consumer choice</p><p>Consumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves. The link between personal preferences, consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics. It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints.</p><h3>Theory of production</h3><p> Main article: Production theory</p><p>Production theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs. Production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use, gift-giving in a gift economy, or exchange in a market economy. This can include manufacturing, storing, shipping, and packaging. Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption. They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production.</p><h3>Costs of production</h3><p> Main article: Cost-of-production theory of value</p><p>The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production: labour, capital, land. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (ex:plant) or circulating capital (ex:intermediate goods).</p><h3>Perfect competition</h3><p> Main article: Perfect competition</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Perfect competition describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as eBay, on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers.</p><p>Benefits of Perfect Competition- All the knowledge such as price and information pertaining goods is equally dispersed among all buyers and sellers. As there are no barriers to enter into the market, monopoly does not usually occur. As all goods and products are same, advertisement is not required and it helps save the advertisement cost.in perfect competition products are identical</p><h3>Monopoly</h3><p> Main article: monopoly</p><p>A monopoly (from Greek monos µ???? (alone or single) + polein p??e?? (to sell)) exists when a single company is the only supplier of a particular commodity.</p><p>Benefits of Monopoly Market- Prices in monopoly market are stable as there is only one firm and so there is no competition. Due to the absence of competition there are high profits and leads to high number of sales monopoly firms tend to receive super profits from their operations.</p><h3>Oligopoly</h3><p> Main article: Oligopoly</p><p>An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output.[5]</p><p>Benefits of oligopoly market-As there is less competition in the firm, it tends to have massive profit.It is also able to easily compare prices forces these companies to keep their prices in competition with the other companies involved in the market.Each company scrambles to come out with latest and greatest thing in order to sway consumers to go with their company over a different one.</p><h3>Market structure</h3><p>The market structure can have several types of interacting market systems. Different forms of markets are a feature of capitalism and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system.</p><p>Examples of markets include but are not limited to: commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, stock markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market.</p><h3>Game theory</h3><p> Main article: Game theory</p><p>Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. The term game here implies the study of any strategic interaction between people. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers &amp; acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design,and voting systems, and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Labour economics</h3><p> Main article: Labour economics</p><p>Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers), the demands of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, labour is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.</p><h3>Welfare economics</h3><p> Main article: Welfare economics</p><p>Welfare economics is a branch of economics that uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well-being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium.[7] It analyzes social welfare, however measured, in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no social welfare apart from the welfare associated with its individual units.</p><h3>Economics of information</h3><p> Main article: Information economics</p><p>Information economics or the economics of information is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions. Information has special characteristics. It is easy to create but hard to trust. It is easy to spread but hard to control. It influences many decisions. These special characteristics (as compared with other types of goods) complicate many standard economic theories.[8]</p><h2>Opportunity cost</h2><p> Main article: Opportunity cost</p><p>Opportunity cost of an activity (or goods) is equal to the best next alternative uses/forgone. Although opportunity cost can be hard to quantify, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real on the individual level. In fact, this principle applies to all decisions, not just economic ones.</p><p>Opportunity cost is one way to measure the cost of something. Rather than merely identifying and adding the costs of a project, one may also identify the next best alternative way to spend the same amount of money. The forgone profit of this next best alternative is the opportunity cost of the original choice. A common example is a farmer that chooses to farm their land rather than rent it to neighbors, wherein the opportunity cost is the forgone profit from renting. In this case, the farmer may expect to generate more profit alone. This kind of reasoning is a very important part of the calculation of discount rates in discounted cash flow investment valuation methodologies. Similarly, the opportunity cost of attending university is the lost wages a student could have earned in the workforce, rather than the cost of tuition, books, and other requisite items (whose sum makes up the total cost of attendance).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives, but rather the benefit of the single, best alternative. Possible opportunity costs of a city's decision to build a hospital on its vacant land are the loss of the land for a sporting center, or the inability to use the land for a parking lot, or the money that could have been made from selling the land, or the loss of any of the various other possible uses — but not all of these in aggregate. The true opportunity cost would be the forgone profit of the most lucrative of those listed.</p><p>One question that arises here is how to determine a money value for each alternative to facilitate comparison and assess opportunity cost, which may be more or less difficult depending on the things we are trying to compare. For example, many decisions involve environmental impacts whose monetary value is difficult to assess because of scientific uncertainty. Valuing a human life or the economic impact of an Arctic oil spill involves making subjective choices with ethical implications.</p><p>It is imperative to understand that no decision on allocating time is free. No matter what one chooses to do, they are always giving something up in return. An example of opportunity cost is deciding between going to a concert and doing homework. If one decides to go the concert, then they are giving up valuable time to study, but if they choose to do homework then the cost is giving up the concert. Any decision in allocating capital is likewise: there is an opportunity cost of capital, or a hurdle rate, defined as the expected rate one could get by investing in similar projects on the open market. Opportunity cost is vital in understanding microeconomics and decisions that are made.</p><h2>Applied</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg/220px-United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg" width="220" height="146"><p>

			Applied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study, many of which draw on methods from other fields. Industrial organization examines topics such as the entry and exit of firms, innovation, and the role of trademarks. Labor economics examines wages, employment, and labor market dynamics. Financial economics examines topics such as the structure of optimal portfolios, the rate of return to capital, econometric analysis of security returns, and corporate financial behavior. Public economics examines the design of government tax and expenditure policies and economic effects of these policies (e.g., social insurance programs). Political economy examines the role of political institutions in determining policy outcomes. Health economics examines the organization of health care systems, including the role of the health care workforce and health insurance programs. Education economics examines the organization of education provision and its implication for efficiency and equity, including the effects of education on productivity. Urban economics, which examines the challenges faced by cities, such as sprawl, air and water pollution, traffic congestion, and poverty, draws on the fields of urban geography and sociology. Law and economics applies microeconomic principles to the selection and enforcement of competing legal regimes and their relative efficiencies. Economic history examines the evolution of the economy and economic institutions, using methods and techniques from the fields of economics, history, geography, sociology, psychology, and political science.</p><p>&lt;ref&gt;==References==</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microeconomics&amp;oldid=783350389"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><h1 lang="en">Rational choice theory</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p> This article is about a theory of economics. For rational choice theory as applied to criminology, see Rational choice theory (criminology).</p><p>Rational choice theory, also known as choice theory or rational action theory, is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behavior.[1] The basic premise of rational choice theory is that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions. The theory also focuses on the determinants of the individual choices (methodological individualism).</p><p>Rational choice theory then assumes that an individual has preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.</p><p>Rationality is widely used as an assumption of the behavior of individuals in microeconomic models and analyses and appears in almost all economics textbook treatments of human decision-making. It is also used in political science,[2] sociology,[3] and philosophy. A particular version of rationality is instrumental rationality, which involves seeking the most cost-effective means to achieve a specific goal without reflecting on the worthiness of that goal. Gary Becker was an early proponent of applying rational actor models more widely.[4] Becker won the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his studies of discrimination, crime, and human capital.[5]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definition and scope</h2><p>The concept of rationality used in rational choice theory is different from the colloquial and most philosophical use of the word. Colloquially, rational behaviour typically means sensible, predictable, or in a thoughtful, clear-headed manner. Rational choice theory uses a narrower definition of rationality. At its most basic level, behavior is rational if it is goal-oriented, reflective (evaluative), and consistent (across time and different choice situations). This contrasts with behavior that is random, impulsive, conditioned, or adopted by (unevaluative) imitation.[citation needed]</p><p>Early neoclassical economists writing about rational choice, including William Stanley Jevons, assumed that agents make consumption choices so as to maximize their happiness, or utility. Contemporary theory bases rational choice on a set of choice axioms that need to be satisfied, and typically does not specify where the goal (preferences, desires) comes from. It mandates just a consistent ranking of the alternatives.[6]:501 Individuals choose the best action according to their personal preferences and the constraints facing them. E.g., there is nothing irrational in preferring fish to meat the first time, but there is something irrational in preferring fish to meat in one instant and preferring meat to fish in another, without anything else having changed.</p><p>Rational choice theorists do not claim that the theory describes the choice process, but rather that it predicts the outcome and pattern of choices. An assumption often added to the rational choice paradigm is that individual preferences are self-interested, in which case the individual can be referred to as a homo economicus. Such an individual acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage.[7] Proponents of such models, particularly those associated with the Chicago school of economics, do not claim that a model's assumptions are an accurate description of reality, only that they help formulate clear and falsifiable hypotheses.[citation needed] In this view, the only way to judge the success of a hypothesis is empirical tests.[7] To use an example from Milton Friedman, if a theory that says that the behavior of the leaves of a tree is explained by their rationality passes the empirical test, it is seen as successful.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg" width="150" height="179"><p>Without specifying the individual's goal or preferences it may not be possible to empirically test, or falsify, the rationality assumption. However, the predictions made by a specific version of the theory are testable. In recent years, the most prevalent version of rational choice theory, expected utility theory, has been challenged by the experimental results of behavioral economics. Economists are learning from other fields, such as psychology, and are enriching their theories of choice in order to get a more accurate view of human decision-making. For example, the behavioral economist and experimental psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for his work in this field.</p><p>Rational choice theory has become increasingly employed in social sciences other than economics, such as sociology, evolutionary theory and political science in recent decades.[8][9] It has had far-reaching impacts on the study of political science, especially in fields like the study of interest groups, elections, behaviour in legislatures, coalitions, and bureaucracy.[10] In these fields, the use of the rational choice paradigm to explain broad social phenomena is the subject of active controversy.[11][12]</p><h2>Actions, assumptions, and individual preferences</h2><p>The premise of rational choice theory as a social science methodology is that the aggregate behavior in society reflects the sum of the choices made by individuals. Each individual, in turn, makes their choice based on their own preferences and the constraints (or choice set) they face.</p><p>At the individual level, rational choice theory stipulates that the agent chooses the action (or outcome) they most prefer. In the case where actions (or outcomes) can be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, a rational individual chooses the action (or outcome) that provides the maximum net benefit, i.e., the maximum benefit minus cost.</p><p>The theory applies to more general settings than those identified by costs and benefit. In general, rational decision making entails choosing among all available alternatives the alternative that the individual most prefers. The alternatives can be a set of actions (what to do?) or a set of objects (what to choose/buy). In the case of actions, what the individual really cares about are the outcomes that results from each possible action. Actions, in this case, are only an instrument for obtaining a particular outcome.</p><h3>Formal statement</h3><p>The available alternatives are often expressed as a set of objects, for example a set of j exhaustive and exclusive actions:</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rational_choice_theory&amp;oldid=770556981"

Many normative (value) judgments, however, are held conditionally, to be given up if facts or knowledge of facts changes, so that a change of values may be purely scientific.[2] On the other hand, welfare economist Amartya Sen distinguishes basic (normative) judgments, which do not depend on such knowledge, from nonbasic judgments, which do. He finds it interesting to note that no judgments are demonstrably basic while some value judgments may be shown to be nonbasic. This leaves open the possibility of fruitful scientific discussion of value judgments.[3]</p><p>Positive and normative economics are often synthesized in the style of practical idealism.

					</p><br><h1 lang="en">Business economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Business economics is a field in applied economics which uses economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze business enterprises and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, capital and product markets.[1] A professional focus of the journal Business Economics has been expressed as providing practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Subject matter</h2><p>Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why corporate firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.[1]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Ambiguity in the use of term</h2><p>The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/industrial organisation, managerial economics, and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly. One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with industry but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.[3] Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.[4]</p><h2>Interpretations from various universities</h2><p>Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.[5] The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at University of Delhi is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.[6]</p><p>The program at Harvard University uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including business administration, management, and related fields of business economics.[7]</p><p>The University of Miami defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.[8]</p><p>Courses at the University of Manchester interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural theory of the firm; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the structure, conduct and performance of business at the industry level.[9]</p><p>Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of Gino Zappa, for example a standard course[10] at the Politecnico di Milano involves studying corporate governance, accounting, investment analysis, budgeting and business strategy.</p><p>La Trobe University of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.</p><h2>Notes</h2><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_economics&amp;oldid=771210217"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Mainstream economics</h1><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Mainstream economics is the body of knowledge, theories, and models of economics, as taught across prominent universities, that are widely accepted by scholars in the field. It can be contrasted to heterodox economics, which are various schools or approaches that are only accepted by their expositors, with little influence on the majority of academic economists. Mainstream economics has been associated with neoclassical economics[1] and with the neoclassical synthesis, which combines neoclassical methods and a Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>United States</h2><p>In the United States, mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary economic schools of thought have been the saltwater and freshwater schools. In the early 1970s, so-called fresh-water economists challenged the prevailing consensus in macroeconomics research. Key elements of their approach were that macroeconomics had to be dynamic, quantitative, and based on how individuals and institutions make decisions under uncertainty. Many of the proponents of this radically new approach to macroeconomics were associated with Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester and the University of Minnesota. They were referred to as the freshwater school since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester, and Minneapolis are located nearer to the Great Lakes. The established consensus was primarily defended by economists at the universities and other institutions located near the east and west coast of the United States, such as Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, and Yale. They were therefore often referred to as the saltwater schools. Today, mainstream economists do not, in general, identify themselves as members of a particular school.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Economics has always featured multiple schools of economic thought, with different schools having different prominence across countries and over time. The current use of the term mainstream economics is specific to the post–World War II era, particularly in the English-speaking world, and to a lesser extent globally.</p><p>Prior to the development of modern academic economics, the dominant school in Europe was mercantilism, which was rather a loose set of related ideas than an institutionalized school. With the development of modern economics, conventionally given as the late 18th-century The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, British economics developed and became dominated by what is now called the classical school. From The Wealth of Nations until the Great Depression, the dominant school within the English-speaking world was classical economics, and its successor, neoclassical economics.[3] In continental Europe, the earlier work of the physiocrats in France formed a distinct tradition, as did the later work of the historical school of economics in Germany, and throughout the 19th century there were debates in British economics, notably the opposition underconsumptionist school.</p><p>During the Great Depression and the following Second World War, the school of Keynesian economics gained prominence, which built on the work of the underconsumptionist school, and present-day mainstream economics stems from the neoclassical synthesis, which was the post–World War II merger of Keynesian macroeconomics and neoclassical microeconomics.</p><p>In continental Europe, by contrast, Keynesian economics was rejected, with German thought dominated by the Freiburg school, whose political philosophy of ordoliberalism formed the intellectual basis of Germany's post-war social market economy. Within developing economies, which formed the majority of the world's population, various schools of development economics have been influential.</p><p>Since 2007, the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the ensuing global economic crisis has publicly exposed divisions within mainstream economics and significantly intensified controversy about its status, with some arguing for radical overhaul or rejection of mainstream economics, others arguing for evolutionary change, and others still arguing that mainstream economics explains the crisis.[4]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Term</h3><p>The term mainstream economics came into common use in the late 20th century. It appears in 2001 edition of the seminal textbook Economics by Samuelson and Nordhaus[5] on the inside back cover in the Family Tree of Economics, which depicts arrows into Modern Mainstream Economics from J.M. Keynes (1936) and neoclassical economics (1860–1910). The term neoclassical synthesis itself also first appears in the 1955 edition of Samuelson's textbook.[6]</p><h2>Scope</h2><p>Mainstream economics can be defined, as distinct from other schools of economics, by various criteria, notably by its assumptions, its methods, and its topics.</p><h3>Assumptions</h3><p>A number of assumptions may underpin many mainstream economic models, while being rejected by some heterodox schools. These include the neoclassical assumptions of rational choice theory, a representative agent, and, often, rational expectations. Much of modern economic modelling consists of exploring the effects that complicating factors have on models, such as imperfect and asymmetric information, incomplete markets, imperfect competition and transaction costs.</p><p>The starting point of orthodox economic analysis is the individual. People are generally defined as units with a common goal: maximisation through rational behaviour. The only differences consist of:</p><p>From this theoretical framework, orthodox economists derive that political action should not be used to solve the problems of the economic system. Instead, the solution ought to derive from an intervention on the above-mentioned maximisation objectives and constraints. It is in this context that economic capitalism finds its justification. Capitalism and its arguments seem logical because orthodox economics theories think of the aggregate economy as the sum of the agents trying to maximise their utility or profit through exchange.[7]</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Mainstream economics has also been defined methodologically as work which mainstream economists are willing to engage, which requires conforming to the mainstream language of mathematical models,[8] featuring calculus, optimization, and comparative statics. Under this definition, areas of thought which are typically thought of as heterodox because they do not work under the typical neoclassical assumptions, such as econophysics, behavioral economics, and evolutionary economics, can be considered mainstream when they are engaged in the mainstream, using mainstream methods.[8] Geoffrey Hodgson has considered the possibility that evolutionary economics and institutional economics may eventually become a new mainstream.[9]</p><p>Additionally, some economic fields include elements of both mainstream economics and heterodox economics: for example, the Austrian economics[how?],[10] institutional economics, neuroeconomics and non-linear complexity theory.[11] They may use neoclassical economics as a point of departure. At least one institutionalist has argued that neoclassical economics no longer dominates a mainstream economics.[12]</p><p>A countervailing trend is the expansion of mainstream methods to such seemingly distant fields as crime, the family, law, politics, and religion. The latter phenomenon is sometimes referred to as economic imperialism.[13]</p><h3>Topics</h3><p>Mainstream economics includes theories of market and government failure and private and public goods. These developments suggest a range of views on the desirability or otherwise of government intervention.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>Since the financial crisis of 2007–2010, considerable conflict has arisen, among both economic theorists and a wider cross-section of the public, regarding the status and future of mainstream economics.[4][14] Some critics have argued that potentially promising approaches have been excluded in major mainstream publications by a focus on problems amenable to formal modeling.[15][16]</p><p>Chartalists, who are generally considered part of the Post-Keynesian school of thought, criticise mainstream theory as failing to describe the actual mechanics of modern fiat monetary economies. Chartalism focuses on a detailed understanding of the way money actually flows through the different sectors of an economy. Specifically, Chartalism focuses on the interaction between central banks, treasury and the private banking system. Chartalism rejects critical mainstream theories such as the loanable funds market, the money multiplier, and the utility of fiscal austerity.</p><p>Some economists, in the vein of ecological economics, believe that the neoclassical holy trinity of rationality, greed, and equilibrium, is being replaced by the holy trinity of purposeful behavior, enlightened self-interest, and sustainability, considerably broadening the scope of what is mainstream.[8] Ecological economics addresses sustainability issues, such as public goods, natural capital and negative externalities (such as pollution).[17]</p><p>Energy related theories of economic concepts also exist within energy economics relating to thermodynamic concepts of economic thinking, such as energy accounting.[18] Biophysical economics relates to this area.[19]</p><h3>Survey articles</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mainstream_economics&amp;oldid=783714535"

It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus.[1][2] The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive. [3]</p><p>A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital) and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.[4]</p><p>Green Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Green economists and economics</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the ecology movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to some equally ill-defined mainstream economics.[citation needed]</p><p>The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capital-G Green term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of 'green economists' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson's presentation of these.)[citation needed]</p><p>Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as canals). Or, it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.[citation needed]</p><p>An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of green economics. As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank[5] and International Monetary Fund (via its Green Fund initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance.[citation needed] Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives.[citation needed] The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that [b]ased on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation.

It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:</p><h2>Ecological measurements</h2><p>Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of economic index indicators.

The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives.[citation needed] However, other experts[13] argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years.[14] Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, Towards a Green Economy,[15] while well-intentioned ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.[16] Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and green growth in particular, based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change and may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions.[17] Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,[18] and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis.[19] He has also criticised the UN's project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB),[20] and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Notes and references</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_economy&amp;oldid=781971723"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><p>Michael Grossman's 1972 model of health production[8] has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable. Grossman's model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health. Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of investments in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of capital. The model acknowledges that health is both a consumption good that yields direct satisfaction and utility, and an investment good, which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman's 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.</p><p>In Grossman's model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the marginal cost of health capital is equal to the marginal benefit. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate d. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: 
		  
			
			  
				M
				
				  C
				  
					H
					K
				  
				
				=
				r
				+
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle MC_{HK}=r+\delta \,}
		  
		. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, 
		  
			
			  
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle \delta \,}
		  
		 increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock. The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.</p><p>Beyond issues of the fundamental, real demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the marginal benefit of medical care (which is always associated with this real demand curve based on derived demand), and a separate effective demand curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices. Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price. The consumer sets MB=MC out of pocket, and so the effective demand will have a separate relationship between price and quantity than will the marginal benefit curve or real demand relationship. This distinction is often described under the rubric of ex-post moral hazard (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).</p><h2>Health technology assessment</h2><p>Economic evaluation, and in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen – IQWiG) in Germany and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.</p><p>Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of cost–utility analysis (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the Quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</p><h2>Healthcare markets</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The five health markets typically analyzed are:</p><p>Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created risk pools in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with adverse selection which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection (cherry-picking), and preexisting condition exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.</p><p>Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting moral hazard drives up costs, as shown by the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.</p><p>Consumers in healthcare markets often suffer from a lack of adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with supplier induced demand, whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial practice variations, whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.</p><p>Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.[9]</p><h2>Other issues</h2><h3>Medical economics</h3><p>Often used synonymously with health economics, medical economics, according to Culyer,[10] is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses mathematical models to synthesise data from biostatistics and epidemiology for support of medical decision-making, both for individuals and for wider health policy.</p><h3>Behavioral economics</h3><p>Peter Orszag has suggested that behavioral economics is an important factor for improving the healthcare system, but that relatively little progress has been made when compared to retirement policy.[11]</p><h3>Mental health economics</h3><p>Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from pharmacoeconomics to labor economics and welfare economics. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children.[12] Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home.[13] In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.[14]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual's potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture presenteeism, when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.[13]</p><p>Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral.[15] Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of knowledge brokers.[13]</p><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;oldid=783361465"

In political science, it is the subset of positive political theory that studies self-interested agents (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained utility maximization, game theory, or decision theory.[1] Public-choice analysis has roots in positive analysis (what is) but is often used for normative purposes (what ought to be) in order to identify a problem or to suggest improvements to constitutional rules (i.e., constitutional economics).[1][2][3]</p><p>The Journal of Economic Literature's classification code regards public choice as a subarea of microeconomics, under JEL: D7: Analysis of Collective Decision-Making (specifically, JEL: D72: Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).[4] Public choice theory is also closely related to social-choice theory, a mathematical approach to aggregation of individual interests, welfares, or votes.[5] Much early work had aspects of both, and both fields use the tools of economics and game theory. Since voter behavior influences the behavior of public officials, public-choice theory often uses results from social-choice theory. General treatments of public choice may also be classified under public economics.[6]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background and development</h2><p>A precursor of modern public choice theory was the work of Knut Wicksell (1896),[7] which treated government as political exchange, a quid pro quo, in formulating a benefit principle linking taxes and expenditures.[8]</p><p>Some subsequent economic analysis has been described as treating government as though it attempted to maximize some kind sort of welfare function for society and as distinct from characterizations of economic agents, such as those in business.[1] In contrast, public choice theory modeled government as made up of officials who, besides pursuing the public interest, might act to benefit themselves, for example in the budget-maximizing model of bureaucracy, possibly at the cost of efficiency.[1][9]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Modern public-choice theory has been dated from the work of Duncan Black, sometimes called the founding father of public choice.[10] In a series of papers from 1948, which culminated in The Theory of Committees and Elections (1958),[11] and later, Black outlined a program of unification toward a more general Theory of Economic and Political Choices based on common formal methods,[12] developed underlying concepts of what would become median voter theory, and rediscovered earlier works on voting theory.[13][1][14]</p><p>Kenneth J. Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values (1951) influenced formulation of the theory. Among other important works are Anthony Downs (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy and Mancur Olson (1965) The Logic of Collective Action.[15]</p><p>James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock coauthored The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy (1962), considered one of the landmarks in public choice. In particular, the preface describes the book as about the political organization of a free society. But its methodology, conceptual apparatus, and analytics are derived, essentially, from the discipline that has as its subject the economic organization of such a society (1962, p. v). The book focuses on positive-economic analysis as to the development of constitutional democracy but in an ethical context of consent. The consent takes the form of a compensation principle like Pareto efficiency for making a policy change and unanimity or at least no opposition as a point of departure for social choice.</p><p>Somewhat later, the probabilistic voting theory started to displace the median voter theory in showing how to find Nash equilibria in multidimensional space. The theory was later formalized further by Peter Coughlin.[16]</p><h2>Decision-making processes and the state</h2><p>One way to organize the subject matter studied by public choice theorists is to begin with the foundations of the state itself. According to this procedure, the most fundamental subject is the origin of government. Although some work has been done on anarchy, autocracy, revolution, and even war, the bulk of the study in this area has concerned the fundamental problem of collectively choosing constitutional rules. This work assumes a group of individuals who aim to form a government, then it focuses on the problem of hiring the agents required to carry out government functions agreed upon by the members.[citation needed]</p><h2>Expressive interests and democratic irrationality</h2><p>Geoffrey Brennan and Loren Lomasky claim that democratic policy is biased to favor expressive interests and neglect practical and utilitarian considerations. Brennan and Lomasky differentiate between instrumental interests (any kind of practical benefit, both monetary and non-monetary) and expressive interests (forms of expression like applause). According to Brennan and Lomasky, the voting paradox can be resolved by differentiating between expressive and instrumental interests.</p><p>This argument has led some public choice scholars to claim that politics is plagued by irrationality. In articles published in the Econ Journal Watch, economist Bryan Caplan contended that voter choices and government economic decisions are inherently irrational.[17][18] Caplan's ideas are more fully developed in his book The Myth of the Rational Voter (Princeton University Press 2007). Countering Donald Wittman's arguments in The Myth of Democratic Failure, Caplan claims that politics is biased in favor of irrational beliefs.</p><p>According to Caplan, democracy effectively subsidizes irrational beliefs. Anyone who derives utility from potentially irrational policies like protectionism can receive private benefits while imposing the costs of such beliefs on the general public. Were people to bear the full costs of their irrational beliefs, they would lobby for them optimally, taking into account both their instrumental consequences and their expressive appeal. Instead, democracy oversupplies policies based on irrational beliefs. Caplan defines rationality mainly in terms of mainstream price theory, pointing out that mainstream economists tend to oppose protectionism and government regulation more than the general population, and that more educated people are closer to economists on this score, even after controlling for confounding factors such as income, wealth or political affiliation. One criticism is that many economists do not share Caplan's views on the nature of public choice. However, Caplan does have data to support his position. Economists have, in fact, often been frustrated by public opposition to economic reasoning. As Sam Peltzman puts it:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Economists know what steps would improve the efficiency of HSE [health, safety, and environmental] regulation, and they have not been bashful advocates of them. These steps include substituting markets in property rights, such as emission rights, for command and control...The real problem lies deeper than any lack of reform proposals or failure to press them. It is our inability to understand their lack of political appeal.[19]</p><p>Public choice's application to government regulation was developed by George Stigler (1971) and Sam Peltzman (1976).</p><h2>Special interests</h2><p>Public choice theory is often used to explain how political decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many advocacy group and pork barrel projects are not the desire of the overall democracy. However, it makes sense for politicians to support these projects. It may make them feel powerful and important. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as lobbyists. The project may be of interest to the politician's local constituency, increasing district votes or campaign contributions. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally. They can gain government favors worth millions or billions for relatively small investments. They face a risk of losing out to their competitors if they don't seek these favors. The taxpayer is also behaving rationally. The cost of defeating any one government give-away is very high, while the benefits to the individual taxpayer are very small. Each citizen pays only a few pennies or a few dollars for any given government favor, while the costs of ending that favor would be many times higher. Everyone involved has rational incentives to do exactly what they are doing, even though the desire of the general constituency is opposite. Costs are diffused, while benefits are concentrated. The voices of vocal minorities with much to gain are heard over those of indifferent majorities with little to individually lose.[20][21] However the notion that groups with concentrated interests will dominate politics is incomplete because it is only one half of political equilibrium. Something must incite those preyed upon to resist even the best organized concentrated interests. In his article on interest groups Gary Becker identified this countervailing force as being the deadweight loss from predation. His views capped what has come to be known as the Chicago school of political economy and it has come in sharp conflict with the so-called Virginia faction of public choice due to its assertion that politics will tend towards efficiency due to nonlinear deadweight losses and due to its claim that political efficiency renders policy advice irrelevant.[22]</p><p>While good government tends to be a pure public good for the mass of voters, there may be many advocacy groups that have strong incentives for lobbying the government to implement specific policies that would benefit them, potentially at the expense of the general public. For example, lobbying by the sugar manufacturers might result in an inefficient subsidy for the production of sugar, either direct or by protectionist measures. The costs of such inefficient policies are dispersed over all citizens, and therefore unnoticeable to each individual. On the other hand, the benefits are shared by a small special-interest group with a strong incentive to perpetuate the policy by further lobbying. Due to rational ignorance, the vast majority of voters will be unaware of the effort; in fact, although voters may be aware of special-interest lobbying efforts, this may merely select for policies which are even harder to evaluate by the general public, rather than improving their overall efficiency. Even if the public were able to evaluate policy proposals effectively, they would find it infeasible to engage in collective action in order to defend their diffuse interest. Therefore, theorists expect that numerous special interests will be able to successfully lobby for various inefficient policies. In public choice theory, such scenarios of inefficient government policies are referred to as government failure – a term akin to market failure from earlier theoretical welfare economics.[20]</p><h2>Rent-seeking</h2><p>A field that is closely related to public choice is rent-seeking. This field combines the study of a market economy with that of government. Thus, one might regard it as a new political economy. Its basic thesis is that when both a market economy and government are present, government agents provide numerous special market privileges. Both the government agents and self-interested market participants seek these privileges in order to partake in the resulting monopoly rent. Rentiers gain benefits above what the market would have offered, but in the process allocate resources in sub-optimal fashion from a societal point of view.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Rent-seeking is broader than public choice in that it applies to autocracies as well as democracies and, therefore, is not directly concerned with collective decision making. However, the obvious pressures it exerts on legislators, executives, bureaucrats, and even judges are factors that public choice theory must account for in its analysis of collective decision-making rules and institutions. Moreover, the members of a collective who are planning a government would be wise to take prospective rent-seeking into account.[21]</p><p>Another major claim is that much of political activity is a form of rent-seeking which wastes resources. Gordon Tullock, Jagdish Bhagwati, and Anne Osborn Krueger have argued that rent-seeking has caused considerable waste.[21] In a parallel line of research Fred McChesney claims that rent extraction causes considerable waste, especially in the developing world. As the term implies, rent extraction happens when officials use threats to extort payments from private parties.</p><h2>Bureaucracy</h2><p>Another major sub-field is the study of bureaucracy. The usual model depicts the top bureaucrats as being chosen by the chief executive and legislature, depending on whether the democratic system is presidential or parliamentary. The typical image of a bureau chief is a person on a fixed salary who is concerned with pleasing those who appointed him. The latter have the power to hire and fire him more or less at will. The bulk of the bureaucrats, however, are civil servants whose jobs and pay are protected by a civil service system against major changes by their appointed bureau chiefs. This image is often compared with that of a business owner whose profit varies with the success of production and sales, who aims to maximize profit, and who can in an ideal system hire and fire employees at will.[9] William Niskanen is generally considered the founder of public choice literature on the bureaucracy.[9]</p><h2>Political stance</h2><p>From such results it is sometimes asserted that public choice theory has an anti-state tilt. But there is ideological diversity among public choice theorists. Mancur Olson for example was an advocate of a strong state and instead opposed political interest group lobbying.[15] More generally, James Buchanan has suggested that public choice theory be interpreted as politics without romance, a critical approach to a pervasive earlier notion of idealized politics set against market failure.[23]</p><p>The British journalist, Alistair Cooke, commenting on the Nobel Prize awarded to James M. Buchanan in 1986, reportedly summarized the public choice view of politicians by saying, Public choice embodies the homely but important truth that politicians are, after all, no less selfish than the rest of us.[24]</p><h2>Recognition</h2><p>Several notable public choice scholars have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, including James M. Buchanan (1986), George Stigler (1982), Gary Becker (1992), Vernon Smith (2002) and Elinor Ostrom (2009). In addition, Vernon Smith and Elinor Ostrom were former presidents of the Public Choice Society.[25]</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>In their 1994 book Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory, political scientists Donald P. Green and Ian Shapiro argue that rational choice theory (of which public choice theory is a branch) has contributed less to the field than its popularity suggests.[26] They write:</p><p>Linda McQuaig writes in All You Can Eat:[citation needed]</p><p>Amartya Sen has acknowledged the contribution of Buchanan and Tullock's analysis of unanimity as a criterion for collective choice,[28] but argued for the logical inconsistency of the Pareto-principle version of unanimity with even minimal liberty in a social-choice framework.[29] More broadly he qualified its use when other information besides personal utility is given a weight in public judgments.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Buchanan and Tullock themselves outline methodological qualifications of the approach developed in their work The Calculus of Consent (1962), p. 30:</p><p>The reach of public choice theory might be even wider than Buchanan and Tullock indicate. Some theory shows that relaxing the assumption of self-interest leaves many public choice problems in place (although sometimes in altered from). As long as political actors are rational maximizers who disagree about the objectives government should pursue, public choice problems persist even if the disagreement stems from adherence to competing ethical principles rather than from competing self-interested wants.[31]</p><h3>New Ideas and Policy Innovation rather than Self Interest</h3><p>Another criticism suggests that some of the great developments in politics and policy have not been a product of individual actor's vested self interests, but rather because of new ideas. New ideas, by virtue of being innovative, expand the policy choices on the menu outside of simple vested interests and allow for equilibriums which were previously not possible. Dani Rodrik of the Harvard Kennedy School provides several examples of this phenomenon, where both Elites and Non-Elites were made better off through policy innovation, or in the case of the democratization of South Africa, making commitments to avoid Hold-up problems.[32]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_choice&amp;oldid=780790157"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Institutional economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behaviour. Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen's instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the ceremonial sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 American Economic Review article by Walton H. Hamilton.[1][2]</p><p>Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics.[3]</p><p>A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the Legal Foundations of Capitalism by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there is heated debate on the role of law (formal institution) on economic growth.[4] Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior.</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assume stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium). It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons.[5] Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically-bounded social system; other institutionalist economists[who?] disagree with Marx's definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals.</p><p>Traditional institutionalism rejects the reduction of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy).[6] Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world-views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley.)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The vacillations of institutions are necessarily a result of the very incentives created by such institutions, and are thus endogenous. Emphatically, traditional institutionalism is in many ways a response to the current economic orthodoxy; its reintroduction in the form of institutionalist political economy is thus an explicit challenge to neoclassical economics, since it is based on the fundamental premise that neoclassicists oppose: that economics cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded.</p><p>Some of the authors associated with this school include Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Mark Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Thorstein Veblen</h2><p> Main articles: Thorstein Veblen and The Theory of the Leisure Class</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Veblen3a.jpg/220px-Veblen3a.jpg" width="220" height="288"><p>


		Thorstein Veblen came from a Norwegian immigrant family in rural Mid-western America.


		</p><p>
			Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929) wrote his first and most influential book while he was at the University of Chicago, on The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899).[7] In it he analyzed the motivation in capitalism to conspicuously consume their riches as a way of demonstrating success. Conspicuous leisure was another focus of Veblen's critique. The concept of conspicuous consumption was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.</p><p>In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of profiteering, did not advocate change.</p><p>Through the 1920s and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Thorstein Veblen's warnings of the tendency for wasteful consumption and the necessity of creating sound financial institutions seemed to ring true. Veblen remains a leading critic, which cautions against the excesses of the American way.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1898 an article entitled Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science[8] and he became the precursor of current evolutionary economics.</p><h2>John R. Commons</h2><p> Main article: John R. Commons</p><p>John R. Commons (1862–1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in Institutional Economics (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes.</p><p>Commons thought that government should be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.</p><h2>Wesley Mitchell</h2><p> Main article: Wesley Mitchell</p><p>Wesley Clair Mitchell (August 5, 1874 – October 29, 1948) was an American economist known for his empirical work on business cycles and for guiding the National Bureau of Economic Research in its first decades.

Laughlin and philosopher John Dewey.</p><h2>Clarence Ayres</h2><p> Main article: Clarence Edwin Ayres</p><p>Clarence Ayres (May 6, 1891 – July 24, 1972) was the principal thinker of what some has called the Texas school of institutional economics. Ayres developed on the ideas of Thorstein Veblen with a dichotomy of technology and institutions to separate the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structures. He claimed that technology was always one step ahead of the socio-cultural institutions.</p><p>It can be argued that Ayres was not an institutionalist in any normal sense of the term; since he identified institutions with sentiments and superstition and in consequence institutions only played a kind of residual role in this theory of development which core center was that of technology. Ayres was under strong influence of Hegel and institutions for Ayres had the same function as Schein (with the connotation of deception, and illusion) for Hegel. A more appropriate name for Ayres' position would be that of a techno-behaviorist rather than an institutionalist.</p><h2>Adolf Berle</h2><p> Main article: Adolf Berle</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg/220px-Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg" width="220" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr.


		</p><p id="lastLine">
			Adolf A. Berle (1895–1971) was one of the first authors to combine legal and economic analysis, and his work stands as a foundig pillar of thought in modern corporate governance. Like Keynes, Berle was at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but subsequently resigned from his diplomatic job dissatisfied with the Versailles Treaty terms. In his book with Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account.</p><p>Directors of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered.</p><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Delaware Valley</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

				This article is about the Philadelphia metropolitan area. For other uses, see Delaware Valley (disambiguation).</p><p>The Delaware Valley is the valley through which the Delaware River flows. By extension, this toponym is commonly used to refer to Greater Philadelphia or Philadelphia metropolitan area (the [Lower] Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area), which straddles the Lower Delaware River just north of its estuary. The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is located at the southern part of the Northeast megalopolis and as such, the Delaware Valley can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is composed of several counties in southeastern Pennsylvania and southwestern New Jersey, one county in northern Delaware and one county in northeastern Maryland. The MSA has a population of over 6 million, while the CSA has a population of over 7.1 million (as of the 2010 Census Bureau count). Philadelphia, being the region's major commercial, cultural, and industrial center, wields a rather large sphere of influence that affects the counties that immediately surround it.</p><p>Some of the Delaware Valley's most well-known contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education and medical institutions. The Delaware Valley has been influential upon American history and industry. The region are leaders in higher education, biotechnology, medicine, tourism and many others. With a gross domestic product of $388&nbsp;billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation.[3]</p><p>The area has hosted many people and sites significant to American culture and history, particularly in the arts, where Philadelphia alone has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city[4], politics, including many influential people involved in politics such as Benjamin Franklin and Joe Biden, and the American Revolution. Philadelphia is famously known as The Birthplace of America[5] as the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were both drafted and signed there. On December&nbsp;7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution, and has since promoted itself as The First State.[6]</p><p>The Delaware Valley was home many other instrumental moments in the American Revolution , including the First and Second Continental Congress, the preservation of the Liberty Bell, the Battles of Germantown, Brandywine, and Red Bank, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, the winter of 1777–78 at Valley Forge, the Philadelphia Convention, and many others.

These are the King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is the largest in the United States (leasable sq. feet of retail space), and the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was the first enclosed mall on the East Coast. Malls, office complexes, strip shopping plazas, expressways, and tract housing are common sights, and more and more continue to replace rolling countryside, farms, woods, and wetlands. However, due to strong opposition by residents and political officials, many acres of land have been preserved throughout the Delaware Valley. Older townships and large boroughs such as Cheltenham, Norristown, Jenkintown, Upper Darby and West Chester retain distinct community identities while engulfed in suburbia. The fastest-growing counties[when?] are Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, and Gloucester. Upper Darby, in Delaware County is the largest township in the United States.[citation needed] Sometimes Reading is included in the Delaware Valley Metro Area.[citation needed]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>The Delaware Valley has four distinct seasons with ample precipitation and is divided by the 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) January isotherm. Most of Philadelphia and the NJ portion, almost all of the DE and MD portions, part of Delaware County, and extreme southern portions of Bucks and Chester Counties have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and normally do vary widely within the Delaware Valley. The region has only two ski areas: Bear Creek Ski and Recreation Area in eastern Berks County and Spring Mountain in central Montgomery County.</p><p>Using the -3&nbsp;°C January isotherm as a boundary, all of the Delaware Valley is humid subtropical except for portions of Berks County and higher areas of northern Chester County. The warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) only exists in higher areas of Berks where all monthly temperatures average below 22&nbsp;°C.</p><h2>Colonial history[edit]</h2><p>See also: Thirteen Colonies</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The valley was the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape, who are recalled in place names throughout the region. The region became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland after the exploration of Delaware Bay in 1609. The Dutch called the Delaware River the Zuyd Rivier, or South River, and considered the lands along it banks and those of its bay to be the southern flank of its province of New Netherland. In 1638, it began to be settled by Swedes, Forest Finns, Dutch, and Walloons and became the colony of New Sweden, though this was not officially recognized by the Dutch Empire which re-asserted control in 1655. The area was taken by the English in 1664.[31] The name Delaware comes from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who had arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1610, just as original settlers were about to abandon it, and thus maintaining the English foothold on the North American continent.</p><h2>Transportation[edit]</h2><p>Many residents commute to jobs in Philadelphia, Camden, and Wilmington with the help of expressways and trains.

Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often subdivided into Asia and Europe (red shades), while North and South America are sometimes recognised as one American continent (green shades).</p><p>A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[1]</p><p>Geologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).</p><p>Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions and application[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Dymaxion_map_unfolded-no-ocean.png/220px-Dymaxion_map_unfolded-no-ocean.png" width="220" height="126"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A Dymaxion map shows land masses with minimal shape distortion.</p><p>By convention, continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.[2] Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion large leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is deemed the smallest continent.</p><p>Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]</p><h3>Extent[edit]</h3><p>The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as the Continent) is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.</p><p>From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]</p><p>From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Island_nations.svg/300px-Island_nations.svg.png" width="300" height="154"><br><p>Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.</p><p>As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]</p><h3>Separation[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Boundaries between the continents of Earth
See also: List of transcontinental countries</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as more or less discrete masses of land.[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.</p><p>North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.</p><p>The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]</p><p>If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.</p><p>When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia–New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.</p><h3>Number[edit]</h3><p> There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:</p><p>The term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.</p><h2>Highest and lowest points[edit]</h2><p>See also: Extremes on Earth, Extreme points of Earth, and Seven Summits</p><p>The following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.</p><p>† The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (-1,512 metres (-4,961&nbsp;ft)[27]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (-2,540 metres (-8,330&nbsp;ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some sources list the Kuma–Manych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc (elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe - the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.</p><h2>Other divisions[edit]</h2><h3>Supercontinents[edit]</h3><p>Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.</p><h3>Subcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[28] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[28]</p><p>In many of these cases, the subcontinents concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[29] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[30][31] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.</p><p>Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[32][33][34] or three (with Central America being the third).[35][36] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[28]</p><h3>Submerged continents[edit]</h3><p>Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.</p><h3>Microcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as the eighth continent from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[37]</p><h3>Botanical continents[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/WGSRPD_World.svg/300px-WGSRPD_World.svg.png" width="300" height="164"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>"Botanical continents" defined by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.</p><p>Continents may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine botanical continents. Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[38]</p><h2>History of continental configurations[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Geological history of the Earth</p><h2>History of the concept[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Strabo.jpg/187px-Strabo.jpg" width="187" height="226"><br><p>The Ancient Greek geographer Strabo holding a globe showing Europa and Asia</p><h3>Early concepts of the Old World continents[edit]</h3><p>The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[39] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[40] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and ...&nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...[39]</p><p>Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[41] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[42] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[43] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[44] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (Libya) and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[45] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.</p><p>Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them islands. Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents peninsulas. These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[46]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Medieval T and O map showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah—Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham).</p><p>Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away.[47]</p><h3>European arrival in the Americas[edit]</h3><p>Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.</p><p>In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[48] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (New World), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[49] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[50] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa,[51] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.</p><p>Within a few years the name New World began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[50]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg/375px-Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg" width="375" height="208"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia</p><p>In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named America after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[52] On the map, the word America was placed on part of South America.</p><h3>The word continent[edit]</h3><p>From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[53] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[54] The noun was used to mean a connected or continuous tract of land or mainland.[53] It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[53] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three parts of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[55]</p><p>While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa. In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new. And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.[56] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as parts of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png/250px-Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png" width="250" height="198"><br><p>Hollandia Nova, 1659 map prepared by Joan Blaeu based on voyages by Abel Tasman and Willem Jansz, this image shows a French edition of 1663</p><h3>Beyond four continents[edit]</h3><p>From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[57]</p><p>Europeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[57] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[58]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Antarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great Antarctic (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[59]</p><p>From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[60]</p><p>From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[60] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]</p><p>Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[61] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Continental crust and Plate tectonics</p><p>Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian shield, typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are high and dry; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[62]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg/350px-Plates_tect2_en.svg.png" width="350" height="239"><br><p>The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal rafts that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.</p><p>There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[63][64] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.</p><p>Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (continental rocks, plate boundaries) are used as appropriate.</p><p>The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.[65][66] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes;[4] its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.[1] The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>For much of European history, the north polar regions remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. Pytheas of Massilia recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called Eschate Thule, where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance on which one can neither walk nor sail. He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as growlers or bergy bits; his Thule was probably Norway, though the Faroe Islands or Shetland have also been suggested.[5]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg/220px-Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg" width="220" height="189"><br><p>Emanuel Bowen's 1780s map of the Arctic features a "Northern Ocean".</p><p>Early cartographers were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in Johannes Ruysch's map of 1507, or Gerardus Mercator's map of 1595) or water (as with Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the Northern Sea Route or the Northwest Passage, to Cathay (China) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as Johann Homann featured an extensive Oceanus Septentrionalis at the northern edge of their charts.</p><p>The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the Arctic Circle in this era added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of navigational charts, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the myth of an Open Polar Sea was persistent. John Barrow, longtime Second Secretary of the British Admiralty, promoted exploration of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.</p><p>In the United States in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers Elisha Kane and Isaac Israel Hayes both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority Matthew Fontaine Maury included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook The Physical Geography of the Sea (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who travelled closer and closer to the pole reported, the polar ice cap is quite thick, and persists year-round.</p><p>Fridtjof Nansen was the first to make a nautical crossing of the Arctic Ocean, in 1896. The first surface crossing of the ocean was led by Wally Herbert in 1969, in a dog sled expedition from Alaska to Svalbard, with air support.[6] The first nautical transit of the north pole was made in 1958 by the submarine USS Nautilus, and the first surface nautical transit occurred in 1977 by the icebreaker NS Arktika.</p><p>Since 1937, Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations have extensively monitored the Arctic Ocean. Scientific settlements were established on the drift ice and carried thousands of kilometres by ice floes.[7]</p><p>In World War II, the European region of the Arctic Ocean was heavily contested: the Allied commitment to resupply the Soviet Union via its northern ports was opposed by German naval and air forces.</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/IBCAO_betamap.jpg/400px-IBCAO_betamap.jpg" width="400" height="456"><br><p>A bathymetric/topographic map of the Arctic Ocean and the surrounding lands.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Arctic.svg/400px-Arctic.svg.png" width="400" height="501"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The Arctic region; of note, the region's southerly border on this map is depicted by a red isotherm, with all territory to the north having an average temperature of less than 10&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) in July.</p><p>The Arctic Ocean occupies a roughly circular basin and covers an area of about 14,056,000&nbsp;km2 (5,427,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), almost the size of Antarctica.[8][9] The coastline is 45,390&nbsp;km (28,200&nbsp;mi) long.[8][10] It is surrounded by the land masses of Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands.</p><p>It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other tributary bodies of water.

The Russian continental shelf consists of three separate, smaller shelves, the Barents Shelf, Chukchi Sea Shelf and Siberian Shelf. Of these three, the Siberian Shelf is the largest such shelf in the world. The Siberian Shelf holds large oil and gas reserves, and the Chukchi shelf forms the border between Russian and the United States as stated in the USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement. The whole area is subject to international territorial claims.</p><h3>Underwater features[edit]</h3><p>An underwater ridge, the Lomonosov Ridge, divides the deep sea North Polar Basin into two oceanic basins: the Eurasian Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500&nbsp;m (13,100 and 14,800&nbsp;ft) deep, and the Amerasian Basin (sometimes called the North American, or Hyperborean Basin), which is about 4,000&nbsp;m (13,000&nbsp;ft) deep. The bathymetry of the ocean bottom is marked by fault block ridges, abyssal plains, ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038&nbsp;m (3,406&nbsp;ft).[13] The deepest point is Litke Deep in the Eurasian Basin, at 5,450&nbsp;m (17,880&nbsp;ft).</p><p>The two major basins are further subdivided by ridges into the Canada Basin (between Alaska/Canada and the Alpha Ridge), Makarov Basin (between the Alpha and Lomonosov Ridges), Amundsen Basin (between Lomonosov and Gakkel ridges), and Nansen Basin (between the Gakkel Ridge and the continental shelf that includes the Franz Josef Land).</p><h2>Oceanography[edit]</h2><h3>Water flow[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg/650px-BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg.png" width="650" height="200"><p>Distribution of the major water mass in the Arctic Ocean.

It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams (Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Mackenzie), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called halocline, in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Copepodkils.jpg/250px-Copepodkils.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>A Copepod</p><p>Because of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It is classified as a mediterranean sea, which as “a part of the world ocean which has only limited communication with the major ocean basins (these being the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans) and where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing”.[14] The Arctic Ocean has a total volume of 18.07×106 km3, equal to about 1.3% of the World Ocean. Mean surface circulation is predominately cyclonic on the Eurasian side and anticyclonic in the Canadian Basin.[15]</p><p>Water enters from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can be divided into three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around 900 metres (3,000 feet) depth.[14] It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow Bering Strait at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the Chukchi Sea.[16] During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4&nbsp;cm/s.[15] This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a halocline.[17]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png/220px-Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png" width="220" height="156"><br><p>The Kennedy Channel.</p><p>This water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.[14] Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the depth range of 150–900 metres (490–2,950 feet) is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the North Atlantic Current enters through the Fram Strait, cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the Arctic Basin counter-clockwise. This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.[16] It flows slowly, at about 0.02&nbsp;m/s.[14] Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&nbsp;°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density.[14] When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the Beaufort Gyre. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.[17]</p><p>The final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from 150–200 metres (490–660 feet). The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the Siberian Shelf.[14] As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3-0.6&nbsp;m/s.[14] Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.</p><p>Waters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard Island, which is about 2,700 metres (8,900 feet) deep and 350 kilometres (220 miles) wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.[16] The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the Coriolis force, which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the Norwegian Current on the eastern side.[14] Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the Hudson Strait (1-2 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.[16]</p><p>As noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses. With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.[15] During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the Icelandic Low, which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer. These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months. There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.[15]</p><h3>Sea ice[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg/300px-2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg" width="300" height="251"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Sea cover in the Arctic Ocean, showing the median, 2005 and 2007 coverage [18]


Main article: Arctic ice pack</p><p>Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the ice has been decreasing since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000&nbsp;km2 (6,023,200&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) at a rate of 3% per decade. The seasonal variations are about 7,000,000&nbsp;km2 (2,702,700&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) with the maximum in April and minimum in September. The sea ice is affected by wind and ocean currents, which can move and rotate very large areas of ice. Zones of compression also arise, where the ice piles up to form pack ice.[19][20][21]</p><p>Icebergs occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island, and icebergs are formed from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. These icebergs pose a hazard to ships, of which the Titanic is one of the most famous. Permafrost is found on most islands. The ocean is virtually icelocked from October to June, and the superstructure of ships are subject to icing from October to May.[11] Before the advent of modern icebreakers, ships sailing the Arctic Ocean risked being trapped or crushed by sea ice (although the Baychimo drifted through the Arctic Ocean untended for decades despite these hazards).</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>See also: Climate change in the Arctic</p><br><img alt="File:North Pole Sea Ice 1990-1999.ogv" style="width:210px;height:158px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv/210px--North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv.jpg"><p>Play media


Changes in ice between 1990–1999</p><p>Under the influence of the Quaternary glaciation, the Arctic Ocean is contained in a polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by the polar night, extreme cold, frequent low-level temperature inversions, and stable weather conditions.[22] Cyclones are only common on the Atlantic side.[23] Summers are characterized by continuous daylight (midnight sun), and temperatures can rise above the melting point (0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F). Cyclones are more frequent in summer and may bring rain or snow.[23] It is cloudy year-round, with mean cloud cover ranging from 60% in winter to over 80% in summer.[24]</p><p>The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Because the Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater, the temperature must reach -1.8&nbsp;°C (28.8&nbsp;°F) before freezing occurs.</p><p>The density of sea water, in contrast to fresh water, increases as it nears the freezing point and thus it tends to sink. It is generally necessary that the upper 100–150&nbsp;m (330–490&nbsp;ft) of ocean water cools to the freezing point for sea ice to form.[25] In the winter the relatively warm ocean water exerts a moderating influence, even when covered by ice. This is one reason why the Arctic does not experience the extreme temperatures seen on the Antarctic continent.</p><p>There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50&nbsp;cm (7.9 to 19.7&nbsp;in) over the frozen ocean.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20&nbsp;°C (50–68&nbsp;°F).[26] The surface waters of the northernmost[27] Arctic Ocean warmed, seasonally at least, enough to support tropical lifeforms[28] requiring surface temperatures of over 22&nbsp;°C (72&nbsp;°F).[29]</p><h2>Animal and plant life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg/220px-Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Three polar bears approach USS Honolulu near the North Pole.</p><p>Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales.

However, the reverse is true in winter when they struggle to get enough light to survive.[31]</p><h2>Natural resources[edit]</h2><p>See also: Natural resources of the Arctic, Territorial claims in the Arctic, and Marine mammal</p><p>Petroleum and natural gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, fish, seals and whales can all be found in abundance in the region.[11][21]</p><p>The political dead zone near the centre of the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark.[32] It is significant for the global energy market because it may hold 25% or more of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources.[33]</p><h2>Environmental concerns[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: Climate change in the Arctic, Ozone depletion, and Pollution in the Arctic Ocean</p><h3>Arctic ice melting[edit]</h3><p>The Arctic ice pack is thinning, and in many years there is also a seasonal hole in the ozone layer.[34] Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism.[21][35] Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free for the first time in human history within a few years or by 2040.[36][37] Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.[38]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>This is a list of contiguous urban areas of the world ordered according to population as of 2014/2015. The figures here have been taken from Demographia's World Urban Areas study.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions and issues</h2><p>For more details on definitions, see World's largest cities.</p><p>Demographia defines an urban area (urbanized area agglomeration or urban centre) as a continuously built up land mass of urban development that is within a labor market (i.e. metropolitan area or metropolitan region), without regard for administrative boundaries (i.e. municipality, city or commune). Except in Australia, the authorities use a minimum urban density definition of 400 persons per square kilometer (or the nearly identical 1,000 per square mile in the United States). Demographia uses maps, satellite photographs to estimate continuous urbanization. Demographia also uses small area population data, where available, to match population estimates to urbanized land area. National census authority data are presented in Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Census of India urban agglomerations are not used in some cases because the geographical size of constituent units (municipalities) often includes large rural (non-urban) areas.</p><p>Sources for population estimates and land area definitions are coded by letter in the Table below, respectively.</p><p>A: National census authority data agglomeration data (land area or population).
B: Demographia land area estimate based upon map or satellite photograph analysis.
C: Demographia population estimate from lower order jurisdictions, including reduction for rural areas.
D: Population estimate based upon the United Nations agglomeration estimate.
E: Demographia population estimate from national census authority data.
F: Other Demographia population estimate, such as from unofficial local reports.
L: Demographia population estimate from local authority data.
N: Combined urban area using national census authority data.
W: Population estimate based upon the World Bank Urban Area 2015 estimate.</p><p>The projected year (2013) population estimate is further calculated from the base year population estimate using population growth rate based upon the United Nations population growth rate with some exceptions.</p><p>The estimates are quite different from the list of World's largest urban agglomerations produced by the United Nations that reports inconsistently on urban geographic, despite its reference to agglomerations. This is evident, for example, in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Seoul and Moscow, where the UN data are for political jurisdictions, rather than urban areas. In other cases, the UN data is for metropolitan area, which are larger than urban areas (such as in Brazil). Finally, the United Nations data is incomplete, excluding some significant urban areas (such as Essen–Düsseldorf in Germany).[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Urban areas are confined to a single nation, unless there is freedom of movement (including labor) between the adjacent nations. Currently, this condition is met only between some continental nations of the European Union and Switzerland (e.g. Lille–Kortrijk in both France and Belgium, Aachen–Vaals in both Germany and Netherlands, Saarbrücken–Forbach in both Germany and France, Geneva–Annemasse in both Switzerland and France, and Basel–Lörrach–Saint-Louis in Switzerland, Germany and France). Thus, Detroit–Windsor in both the United States and Canada, and San Diego–Tijuana in both the United States and Mexico are not treated as single urban areas. Moreover, Shenzhen–Hong Kong is treated as separate urban areas, principally because labor movement between the two is limited, with the former within China and the latter a special administrative region of China.[citation needed]</p><p>According to the report, there are 875 identified urban areas in the world with 500,000 or more population as of 2013. Demographia released along with the report include a disclaimer that this list of data is compiled on best available information, the vary nature of which is changing rapidly and quality is improving as it becomes available, yet still remains highly variable between nations, and hefty revisions are not unforeseen for the future. Appropriate caution is therefore advised.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Cities2million.png/400px-Cities2million.png" width="400" height="199"><br><p>224 urban areas with population of over two million</p><h2>Urban areas (population over 1,000,000)</h2><h2>Number of urban areas by country in 2016</h2><h2>See also</h2><h2>References and notes</h2><h2> </h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

For instance, Long Island can be divided into its South and North Shores (usually when speaking about Nassau County and western Suffolk County) and the East End. The Hudson Valley and Connecticut are sometimes grouped together and referred to as the Northern Suburbs, largely because of the shared usage of the Metro-North Railroad system.[23]</p><h3>Subregions[edit]</h3><p>New York City[edit]
Main article: New York City</p><p>The geographical, cultural, and economic center of the metropolitan area is New York City, which consists of five boroughs, each of which is also a county of New York State.[24] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[25] With a Census-estimated population of 8,550,405 in 2015 (8,491,079 in 2014[26][27]), distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790&nbsp;km2),[28] New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[29] A global power city,[30] New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace[31][32] defining the term New York minute.[33] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[34] New York is an important center for international diplomacy[35] and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital[36][37] of the world.[38][39][40][41][42]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Long Island[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Pineapple_-_Garden_City_NY.jpg/220px-Pineapple_-_Garden_City_NY.jpg" width="220" height="236"><br><p>The Village of Garden City in Nassau County, Long Island's Town of Hempstead, which with over 770,000 people is the New York metropolitan area's most populous individual municipality outside New York City.[43]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/WesthamptonInnerWaterway.jpg/220px-WesthamptonInnerWaterway.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Westhampton, Suffolk County, New York, on the East End of Long Island.


Main article: Long Island</p><p>Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region wholly within both the U.S. state of New York and the New York City metropolitan area. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, most people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term Long Island (or The Island) exclusively to refer to the Nassau-Suffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character.[44] North of the island is Long Island Sound, across which are the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p><p>With a Census-estimated population of 7,838,722 in 2015, constituting nearly 40% of New York State's population,[45][46][47][48][49] The majority of New York City residents, 58% as of 2015, now live on Long Island, namely the estimated the 4,896,398 residents living in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.[50] Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 17th-most populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaido). Its population density is 5,571 inhabitants per square mile (2,151/km2). If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first in population density. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[51][52] The Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, with an estimated population of 770,367 in 2016, is the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside of New York City.[43]</p><p>Long Island is the most populated island in the United States and the 17th most populous island in the world. Known especially for recreation, boating and miles of public beaches, including numerous town, county and state parks and Fire Island National Seashore. Along the north shore, the Gold Coast of Long Island is an upscale section of Nassau and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th century, of which only a few remain preserved as historic sites. The East End of Long Island (known as the Twin Forks because of its physical shape) boasts open spaces for farmland and wineries. The South Fork, in particular, comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as The Hamptons and has an international reputation as a playground for the rich and famous, with some of the wealthiest communities in the United States. In 2015, according to Business Insider, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S. by real estate-listings site Property Shark, with a median home sale price of $5,125,000.[53] During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside in mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying the beaches, gardens, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Long Island is served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway being major east-west routes across significant portions of the island. Passenger rail access is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Long Island Rail Road, one of the largest commuter railroads in the United States. Air travel needs are served by several airports. Within Queens, the island is home to John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, two of the three major airline hubs serving the New York City area (with Newark Liberty International Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey). Islip MacArthur Airport (serving commercial airlines) and Farmingdale/Republic Airport (private and commuter flights) are both located in Suffolk County.</p><p>Northern New Jersey[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bigfalls14w_info.jpg/220px-Bigfalls14w_info.jpg" width="220" height="137"><br><p>The Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson, Passaic County, New Jersey, dedicated as a National Historical Park in November 2011, incorporates one of the largest waterfalls in the eastern United States.[54]

Lower Hudson Valley[edit]
Main article: Hudson Valley</p><p>Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, and quaint small towns and villages, the Lower Hudson Valley is centered around the Hudson River north of New York City and lies within New York State. Its two most populous counties, Westchester and Rockland, are located on the eastern and western sides of the river, respectively, connected by the heavily trafficked Tappan Zee Bridge (a major commuter route from Rockland County towards New York City) as well as the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region's rail commuters. Southern Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains. Although many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence and expense (some examples: Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Katonah, and Briarcliff Manor), the Lower Hudson Valley as a whole is one of the fastest-growing areas in the metropolitan area because of high housing costs in New York City and the inner suburbs.</p><p>Historically, the valley was home to many factories, including paper mills, but a significant number have closed. After years of lingering pollution, cleanup efforts to improve the Hudson River water quality are currently planned and will be supervised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[56]</p><p>Western Connecticut[edit]</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/MohawkMountain.jpg/220px-MohawkMountain.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area in Cornwall, Litchfield County, Connecticut, in the Berkshire Mountains.

Large business and industrial parks are scattered throughout the area, though mostly contained within Fairfield County. The three counties (and Connecticut in general) are known for affluence. Geographically, the areas are flat along the coast with low hills eventually giving way to larger hills such as The Berkshires further inland, to the Massachusetts border. Most of the largest cities in the state are located within New Haven County (home to Yale University) and Fairfield County.</p><p>Monroe and Pike Counties, Pennsylvania[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Dingmansfalls.jpg/220px-Dingmansfalls.jpg" width="220" height="291"><br><p>Dingmans Falls in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Pike County, northeastern Pennsylvania.

As of the 2010 Census, the population was 57,369.[57] Its county seat is Milford.[58] Part of the Pocono Mountains region lies within Pike County, which has ranked among the fastest-growing counties of Pennsylvania.[59]</p><p>Monroe County was added to the CMSA in March 2013, as was the Lehigh Valley. Monroe's county seat is Stroudsburg, and its largest borough is East Stroudsburg. Monroe and Pike are the fastest-growing counties in Pennsylvania and are home to many residents who commute to jobs in Northern New Jersey and New York City. They are located largely in the Pocono Mountains and have multiple state parks as well as most of the Pennsylvania portion of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Efforts continue to resume passenger rail service on the Lackawanna Cutoff route between Scranton and Northern New Jersey via Monroe County.</p><p>Lehigh Valley[edit]

It constitutes the third-largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania, and Allentown is the state's third-largest city. The region is important for east-west transportation between New York City, northern and central New Jersey, the Harrisburg metropolitan area, and points west, both by rail and Interstate 78. It is also critical for north-south road traffic via Interstate 476 and the Route 33 Expressway. The Lehigh Valley is in the process of major urban economic redevelopment, including development of the logistics industry as well as the Two Rivers Landing in downtown Easton, the Steel Stacks/Sands complex on the south side of Bethlehem, and a multi-purpose arena (which hosted its first event on September 12, 2014) in downtown Allentown. In 2010 the population was 712,481 for the PA portion and 821,173 in the MSA as a whole.

<div class="content"><p>From the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the Age of Discovery, and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the Great Divergence, a term coined by Samuel Huntington[58] the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.</p><h3>Modern era[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg/170px-Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg" width="170" height="206"><br><p>The United States Constitution</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg/170px-Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg" width="170" height="135"><br><p>La Liberté guidant le Peuple by French painter Eugène Delacroix</p><p>Coming into the modern era, the historical understanding of the East-West contrast—as the opposition of Christendom to its geographical neighbors—began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The Age of Discovery faded into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the Catholic Church; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism.</p><p>Philosophers of the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Voltaire (1694–1778), David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.[59] influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as enlightened absolutism. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by Voltaire spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the scientific revolution, spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of modern science, during which developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.[60][61][62][63][64][65] While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution, and its completion is attributed to the grand synthesis of Newton's 1687 Principia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools.[66] These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.[67]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/220px-Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>A Watt steam engine. The steam engine, made of iron and fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world.[68]</p><p>The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[69][70][71] The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[72][73][74][75] GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,[76] while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.[77] Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants[78] and fire.</p><p>The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories.[79][80][81]</p><h2>Arts and humanities[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg/220px-Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg" width="220" height="243"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry showing William the Conqueror (centre), his half-brothers Robert, Count of Mortain (right) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux in the Duchy of Normandy (left).

This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.[83]</p><p>The symphony, concerto, sonata, opera, and oratorio have their origins in Italy. Many important musical instruments used by cultures all over the world were also developed in the West; among them are the violin, piano, pipe organ, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, accordion, and the theremin. The solo piano, symphony orchestra, and the string quartet are also important performing musical forms.</p><p>Many forms of popular music have been derived from African-Americans, and their innovations of jazz and blues serve as the basis from which much of modern popular music derives. Folklore and music during 19th and 20th centuries, initially by themselves, but later played and further developed together with White and Black Americans, British people, and Westerners in general. These include jazz, blues and rock music (that in a wider sense include the rock and roll and heavy metal genres), rhythm and blues, funk, hip hop, techno as well as the ska and reggae genres from Jamaica. Several other related or derived styles were developed and introduced by Western pop culture such as pop and dance music.</p><h3>Painting and photography[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Attributed_to_Jan_van_Eyck%2C_Netherlandish_%28active_Bruges%29%2C_c._1395_-_1441_-_Saint_Francis_of_Assisi_Receiving_the_Stigmata_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Attributed_to_Jan_van_Eyck%2C_Netherlandish_%28active_Bruges%29%2C_c._1395_-_1441_-_Saint_Francis_of_Assisi_Receiving_the_Stigmata_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="189"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata, attributed to Jan van Eyck, from 1430 until 1432</p><p>Jan van Eyck, among other renaissance painters, made great advances in oil painting, and perspective drawings and paintings had their earliest practitioners in Florence.[84] In art, the Celtic knot is a very distinctive Western repeated motif.

It is widely considered the preeminent work in Italian literature,[86] and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.[87] The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. In this scene, Charon comes to ferry souls across the river Acheron to the Christian Hell. Engraving by Gustave Doré</p><p>While epic literary works in verse such as the Mahabharata and Homer's Iliad are ancient and occurred worldwide, the prose novel as a distinct form of storytelling, with developed, consistent human characters and, typically, some connected overall plot (although both of these characteristics have sometimes been modified and played with in later times), was popularized by the West[88] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the Hellenistic world and in Heian Japan. Both Petronius' Satyricon (c. 60 CE) and the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.</p><p>Tragedy, from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical opera.</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg/260px-Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg" width="260" height="260"><br><p>Rayonnant rose window in Notre Dame de Paris.

The scientific method as a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses was almost entirely fashioned by the Italian Galileo Galilei.[90][91]</p><p>The Western World has been the leading force in the technological and scientific disciplines: whether measured in people or events, 97 percent of accomplishment in the scientific inventories occurred in Europe and North America. The Dictionary of Scientific Biography (DoSB) sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies, concluded that Eighty-one percent of the most significant scientists and mathematicians come from Europe compared to 76 percent in the Human Accomplishment set, numbers that rise to 94 and 91 percent respectively when the United States and Canada are included.[92] The United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy alone account for 72 percent of all the significant scientific figures in science from 1400 to 1950. Add in Russia and the Netherlands, and 80 percent of all significant figures are accounted for.[93]</p><p>By the will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel the Nobel Prize were established in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[94] The percentage of ethnically European noble prize winners during the first and second halves of the 20th century were respectively 98 and 94 percent.[95] A study by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) - Japan's equivalent of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) concluded that 54% of the world's most important inventions were British. Of the rest, 25% were American and 5% Japanese.[96]</p><p>It was the West that first developed steam power and adapted its use into factories, and for the generation of electric power.[97][98] The electrical motor, dynamo, transformer, and electric light, and indeed most of the familiar electrical appliances, were inventions of the West.[99][100][101][102] The Otto and the Diesel internal combustion engines are products whose genesis and early development were in the West.[103][104] Nuclear power stations are derived from the first atomic pile constructed in Chicago in 1942.[105]</p><p>Communication devices and systems including the telegraph, the telephone, radio, television, communications and navigation satellites, mobile phone, and the Internet were all invented by Westerners.[106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] The pencil, ballpoint pen, Cathode ray tube, liquid-crystal display, light-emitting diode, camera, photocopier, laser printer, ink jet printer, plasma display screen and world wide web were also invented in the West.[114][115][116][117][118][119]</p><p>Ubiquitous materials including concrete, aluminium, clear glass, synthetic rubber, synthetic diamond and the plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene were invented in the West. Iron and steel ships, bridges and skyscrapers first appeared in the West. Nitrogen fixation and petrochemicals were invented by Westerners. Most of the elements, were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary atomic theories to explain them.[citation needed]</p><p>The transistor, integrated circuit, memory chip, and computer were all first seen in the West. The ship's chronometer, the screw propeller, the locomotive, bicycle, automobile, and airplane were all invented in the West. Eyeglasses, the telescope, the microscope and electron microscope, all the varieties of chromatography, protein and DNA sequencing, computerised tomography, Nuclear magnetic resonance, x-rays, and light, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories.[citation needed]</p><p>In medicine, the pure antibiotics were created in the West. The method of preventing Rh disease, the treatment of diabetes, and the germ theory of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of smallpox, was led by a Westerner, Donald Henderson. Radiography, Computed tomography, Positron emission tomography and Medical ultrasonography are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of clinical chemistry including the methods of spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay were first devised by Westerners. So were the stethoscope, electrocardiograph, and the endoscope. Vitamins, hormonal contraception, hormones, insulin, Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, along with a host of other medically proven drugs were first utilized to treat disease in the West. The double-blind study and evidence-based medicine are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In mathematics, calculus, statistics, logic, vectors, tensors and complex analysis, group theory and topology were developed by Westerners.[120][121][122][123][124][125][126] In biology, evolution, chromosomes, DNA, genetics and the methods of molecular biology are creatures of the West. In physics, the science of mechanics and quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics were all developed by Westerners. The discoveries and inventions by Westerners in electromagnetism include Coulomb's law (1785), the first battery (1800), the unity of electricity and magnetism (1820), Biot–Savart law (1820), Ohm's Law (1827), and the Maxwell's equations (1871).

The first expedition to circumnavigate the Earth (1522) was by Westerners, as well as the first journey to the South Pole (1911), and the first moon landing (1969).[129][130] The landing of robots on Mars (2004 and 2012) and on an asteroid (2001), the Voyager 2 explorations of the outer planets (Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989), Voyager 1's passage into interstellar space (2013), and New Horizons' flyby of Pluto (2015) were significant recent Western achievements.[131][132][133][134][135]</p><h2>Media[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Western media</p><p>The Western media refers to the news media of the Western world. The roots of the Western media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when printing presses began to operate throughout Western Europe. The emergence of news media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press, from which the publishing press derives its name.[136]</p><p>In the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of Latin in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the discoveries arising from trade and travel, navigation to the new world, science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in Western Europe.[137]</p><p>After the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the U.S. launching Telstar in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in America in 1975.[138]</p><p>Beginning in the 1990s, the Internet has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages (magazines, CDs, television and radio slots), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items (articles, audio and video files).[139]</p><h2>Religion[edit]</h2><p>The native religions of Europe were polytheistic but not homogenous—however they were similar insofar as they were predominantly Indo-European in origin. Roman religion was similar to but not the same as Hellenic religion—likewise the same for indigenous Germanic polytheism, Celtic polytheism and Slavic polytheism. Western culture, for at least the last 1000 years, has been considered nearly synonymous with Christian culture.[140] Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards.</p><p>Western culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians. The notion of Europe and the Western World has been intimately connected with the concept of Christianity and Christendom many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.[17]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As in other areas, Judaism is found in the Western world. Minority groups, and Jews in particular, often had to contend with discrimination and persecution. This could include being subjected to violence and/or destruction of property (this may be referred to as a pogrom) as well as being expelled or banned from various polities, hoping to find havens in other places.[141]</p><p>Religion has waned considerably in Europe, where many are today irreligious, agnostic or atheist and they make up about 18% of the European population.[142] In terms of irreligion, over half of the populations of the Czech Republic (79% of the population was agnostic, atheist or irreligious), the United Kingdom (~25%),[143] Germany (25–33%),[144] France (30–35%)[145][146][147] and the Netherlands (39–44%) are agnostic, atheist, or otherwise non-religious.</p><p>However, per another survey by Pew Research Center from 2011, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world where 70–84% are Christians,[148] According to this survey, 76% of Europeans described themselves as Christians,[148][149][150] and about 86% of the Americas population identified themselves as Christians,[151] (90% in Latin America and 77% in North America).[152] And 73% in Oceania are self-identify as Christian, and 76% in South Africa is Christian.[148]</p><p>According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population.[153] Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU population, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%.[154] Non believer/Agnostic account 16%,[153] Atheist account's 7%,[153] and Muslim 2%.[153]</p><p>Throughout the Western world there are increasing numbers of people who seek to revive the indigenous religions of their European ancestors, such groups include Germanic, Roman, Hellenic, Celtic and Slavic, polytheistic reconstructionist movements, likewise, Wicca, new age spirituality and other neo-pagan belief systems enjoy notable minority support in Western nations.</p><h2>Sport[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Bull-leaping.jpg/220px-Bull-leaping.jpg" width="220" height="119"><br><p>The Bull-Leaping Fresco from the Great Palace at Knossos, Crete.

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at Athens in 1896.</p><p>The Romans built immense structures such as the Colisseum in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for blood sports, such as the infamous Gladiatorial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of Classical Antiquity—such as Greco-Roman wrestling, discus and javelin. The sport of bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice and is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its Central and South American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.</p><p>Jousting and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the Middle Ages, and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of the popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. The Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence—these include Ping Pong, modern tennis, Association Football, Netball and Rugby.</p><p>Football (also known as soccer) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the world game. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the Rugby World Cup has been shared among the Western nations of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.</p><p>Australian Rules Football, an Australian variation of football with similarities to Gaelic football and rugby evolved in the British colony of Victoria in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of baseball to America during the colonial period. The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Many games known as football were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, the Father of American Football. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. From these American origins, basketball has become one of the great international participation sports.</p><p>Professionalism in sport in the West became prevalent during the 20th Century, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet—all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.</p><h2>Themes and traditions[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg/220px-Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg" width="220" height="279"><br><p>A Madonna and Child painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas.</p><p>Western culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:[citation needed]</p><h3>Notes[edit]</h3><h3> [edit]</h3><br><img alt="Page semi-protected" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png" width="20" height="20"><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Africa</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square&nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4% of its total land area.[2] With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population.[1] The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.[3]</p><p>Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[4][5] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[6] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.[7] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.[8]</p><p>Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonised almost all of Africa. Africa also varies greatly with regard to environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. However, most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations have attempted to cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg/170px-Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg" width="170" height="228"><br><p>Statue representing Africa at Palazzo Ferreria, in Valletta, Malta</p><p>Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[9][10] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician ?afar 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis[11] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) cave, in reference to cave dwellers.[12] The same word[12] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[13]</p><p>Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[14] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, located in modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.</p><p>According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while Asia was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.</p><p>Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name Africa:</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Africa

Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0&nbsp;million years BP,[20] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4&nbsp;million years BP)[21] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9&nbsp;million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[2]</p><p>After the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[22][23][24] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[25][26] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[27] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[28]</p><p>Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[29]</p><p>The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[30] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[31] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[32] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.</p><p>The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[33] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.</p><p>Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[34] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[34]</p><p>By the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,[35] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[34]</p><h3>Early civilizations</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Ancient African history</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg/220px-Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt, date from around 1400 BC.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Bantu_expansion.png/170px-Bantu_expansion.png" width="170" height="180"><br><p>The origins and spread of the Bantu languages c. 1000 BC to c. 500 AD</p><p>At about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.[36] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[37][38] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[39]</p><p>An independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[40][41][42]</p><p>European exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans.[citation needed] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[43]</p><p>Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[44]</p><p>Christianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[45] by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[46]</p><p>In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Ninth to eighteenth centuries</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg/170px-Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg" width="170" height="234"><br><p>African horseman of Baguirmi in full padded armour suit</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG/170px-Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG" width="170" height="232"><br><p>The intricate 9th-century bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu, in Nigeria displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.[48]</p><p>Pre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[49] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.</p><p>By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.</p><p>In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu.

Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.</p><p>The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[51] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[52] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[53]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg/220px-Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg" width="220" height="132"><br><p>Ruins of Great Zimbabwe (eleventh to fifteenth centuries)</p><p>Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[54] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cedid_Atlas_%28Africa%29_1803.jpg/220px-Cedid_Atlas_%28Africa%29_1803.jpg" width="220" height="184"><br><p>1803 Cedid Atlas, showing the Africa from the perspective of the Ottoman Empire.

Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.[57][58][59] More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[60]</p><p>In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[61]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg/220px-The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg" width="220" height="166"><br><p>Slave being inspected, from Captain Canot; or, Twenty Years of an African Slaver</p><p>Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against the usurping King of Lagos, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[62] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[63]</p><h3>Colonialism and the Scramble for Africa</h3><p>Main article: Colonization of Africa

Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.</p><h3>Berlin Conference</h3><p>The Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.</p><h3>Independence struggles</h3><p>Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[64] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[65] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.</p><p>Portugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.</p><h3>Post-colonial Africa</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Mobutu_Sese_Seko_1973.jpg" width="140" height="186"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5 billion from his country.</p><p>Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.</p><p>Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/SADF-Operations_4.jpg/220px-SADF-Operations_4.jpg" width="220" height="177"><br><p>South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the South African Border War</p><p>Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund,[citation needed] also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.[66][67][68] The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[69] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.</p><p>In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[70] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[71]</p><h2>Geography</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Geography of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/187_1003703_africa_dxm.png/220px-187_1003703_africa_dxm.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Satellite photo of Africa.

This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.[77]</p><p>Deforestation is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).[80] According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.[77] Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in West Africa have been destroyed.[81] Over 90% of Madagascar's original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.[82] About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.[83]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>See also: Afrotropic ecozone and Palearctic ecozone</p><h2>Politics</h2><p>See also: List of political parties in Africa by country</p><p>There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states.

Main article: African Union</p><p>The African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[84] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.</p><p>The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.</p><p>Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg/450px-Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg.png" width="450" height="405" usemap="#ImageMap_1_1093313515"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="The image above contains clickable links" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Interactive_icon.svg/18px-Interactive_icon.svg.png" title="The image above contains clickable links" width="18" height="27"><p>Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational African entities v • d • e</p><h2>Economy</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/RECs_of_the_AEC.svg/220px-RECs_of_the_AEC.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Map of the African Economic Community.

Main article: Economy of Africa
See also: Economy of the African Union and Water in Africa</p><p>Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[85] According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[86]</p><p>Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[87] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.[88]</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[89] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[90][91][92]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[93] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[94] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[95] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[96] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.[97]</p><p>In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[70]</p><p>A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.[98]</p><p>During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.[99]</p><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Main article: Demographics of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Kobli1.jpg/220px-Kobli1.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Woman from Benin</p><p>Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.[100] The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.[101] As of 2014, the population of Africa is estimated at 1.2 billion.[102] Africa's total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; African population surpassed Europe in the 1990s, while the Americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; Africa's rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time - India and China's 1.4 billion people each will swap ranking around the year 2022.[103]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/San_tribesman.jpg/170px-San_tribesman.jpg" width="170" height="254"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>San Bushman man from Botswana</p><p>Speakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger–Congo family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from The Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[104] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (San or Bushmen) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also San, closely related to, but distinct from Hottentots) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[105]</p><p>The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.</p><p>The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[106] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[citation needed]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bedscha.jpg/220px-Bedscha.jpg" width="220" height="196"><br><p>Beja bedouins from Northeast Africa</p><p>In the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.</p><p>Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[107] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[108] Kenya, Congo,[109] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[110] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[111] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa.[112] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[113] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[114]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[70] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[115]</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Main article: Languages of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg/170px-Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg" width="170" height="196"><br><p>Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa:

Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:</p><p>Following the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.</p><h2>Culture</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg/220px-Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The rock-hewn Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Main article: Culture of Africa</p><p>Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[118] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to civilize Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[118]</p><p>Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[119] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art. [120] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[120] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art. [121] In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.[122] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe. [123] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies. [124]</p><p>There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.</p><h3>Visual art and architecture</h3><p>African art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.[125] The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg/170px-Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg" width="170" height="340"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A musician from South Africa</p><h3>Music and dance</h3><p>Main article: Music of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg/170px-Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg" width="170" height="227"><br><p>The Namibia rugby team</p><p>Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.</p><h3>Sports</h3><p>Fifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.</p><p>Cricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p><h2>Religion</h2><p>Main article: Religion in Africa

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions.

				This article is about the group of islands. For the indigenous inhabitants of Caribbean region and people of Caribbean descent, see Caribbean people. For the body of water surrounding them, see Caribbean Sea. For other uses, see Caribbean (disambiguation).</p><p>The Caribbean (/?kær?'bi??n/ or /k?'r?bi?n/) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea[3] and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean[4]) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.</p><p>Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the region comprises more than 700 islands, islets, reefs and cays. (See the list.) These islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea.[5] The Caribbean islands, consisting of the Greater Antilles on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east (including the Leeward Antilles), are part of the somewhat larger West Indies grouping, which also includes the Lucayan Archipelago (comprising the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands) north of the Greater Antilles and Caribbean Sea. In a wider sense, the mainland countries of Belize, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana are often included due to their political and cultural ties with the region.[6]</p><p>Geopolitically, the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of North America[7][8][9][10][11] and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies. From December 15, 1954, to October 10, 2010, there was a country known as the Netherlands Antilles composed of five states, all of which were Dutch dependencies.[12] From January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was also a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then British dependencies. The West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology and pronunciation[edit]</h2><p>The region takes its name from that of the Caribs, an ethnic group present in the Lesser Antilles and parts of adjacent South America at the time of the Spanish conquest of America.[13]</p><p>The two most prevalent pronunciations of Caribbean are KARR-?-BEE-?n, with the primary accent on the third syllable, and k?-RIB-ee-?n, with the accent on the second. The former pronunciation is the older of the two, although the stressed-second-syllable variant has been established for over 75 years.[14] It has been suggested that speakers of British English prefer KARR-?-BEE-?n while North American speakers more typically use k?-RIB-ee-?n,[15] although not all sources agree.[16] Usage is split within Caribbean English itself.[17]</p><h2>Definition[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png/300px-CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png" width="300" height="207"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Map of the Caribbean</p><p>The word Caribbean has multiple uses.

<div class="content"><p> Further information: Evolution of microeconomics</p><p>Microeconomics (from Greek prefix mikro- meaning small) is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms.[1][2][3]</p><p>One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results.</p><p>Microeconomics stands in contrast to macroeconomics, which involves the sum total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment and with national policies relating to these issues.[2] Microeconomics also deals with the effects of economic policies (such as changing taxation levels) on the aforementioned aspects of the economy.[4] Particularly in the wake of the Lucas critique, much of modern macroeconomic theory has been built upon 'microfoundations'—i.e. based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Assumptions and definitions</h2><p>Microeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual. To economists, rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive. The technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function. Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable.</p><p>Microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set. It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no guarantee that a rational individual would maximize utility. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory. The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences. The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices but why individuals make choices as well.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is a constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. That is, since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed, a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence.</p><p>The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as the primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as the primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as Revealed preference theory.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg/220px-Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability at each price (supply) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand). The graph depicts a right-shift in demand from D1 to D2 along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new market-clearing equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).

			The theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive. This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions.</p><p>Mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss. A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good. In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating missing markets to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed.</p><p>This is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory. Optimal welfare usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor–Hicks method. This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory.</p><p>The demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set.</p><p>
		Microeconomic theories are involved with the choices that households and firms make. Some of these microeconomic concepts include elasticity of demand and supply, market structures and utility. Microeconomic looks into the way individuals and businesses behave in coming up with decisions to do with the distribution of rare resources and collaborations between these individuals and the firm. A production possibility frontier illustrates the maximum probable output combinations of two services or goods an economy may realise while all other resources are efficiently and wholly engaged. A production possibility frontier is used to explain the models of opportunity cost, illustrate the effects of economic development and demonstrate the theory of trade-offs.</p><p>Supply and demand is possibly amongst the most crucial conceptions of economics and it is the pillar of the economy of a market. Demand can be explained as the extent to which a service or a good is desired by users. The amount demanded is the sum of a commodity individuals are ready to purchase at a certain given price. Supply on the other hand refers to how much of a product a market can provide. The supplied quantity is the volume of a particular commodity manufacturers are willing to supply at a certain price. The relationship between demand and supply trigger the forces as a result of the sharing of resources. The law of demand states that when all other influences stay constant the higher the price of a good, the lesser the demand of the given produce. In other word the greater the price the lower the amount needed. The amount of a good bought by customers at a greater price is lower as the price rises the opportunity cost of buying a commodity. People will therefore naturally evade buying a commodity that will need them to sacrifice the use of something else that is more significant to them. Similar to the law of demand, the law of supply reveals the amounts that will be traded at a certain given price. Contrasting the law of demand, the supply relationship gives a rising slope. This means that the bigger the price the greater the quantity in supply. Manufacturers supply more at a high price because selling a quantity at a higher price rises income. Where demand and supply are the same, the economy is held to be at equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium the distribution of goods is at its most effectual because the amount of goods at supply is precisely the same as the volume of goods in demand. Therefore every individual is contented with prevailing state of the economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Elasticity is defined as the degree of receptiveness in demand and supply in relation to fluctuations in price. If a curve is more elastic then lesser alterations in price will result to a higher change in quantity used up. If a curve is less elastic it will then cause higher deviations in price to affect a change in amount consumed. Price elasticity of demand is the extent of responsiveness in quantity demanded in relation to price. Utility on the other hand is the amount of contentment resulting from the consumption of a commodity or services at a particular period. Utility is a psychological satisfaction not inherent. It is dependent on the persons own subjective approximate of satisfaction to be acquired from the consumption of a commodity. Utility is further divided into marginal utility, total utility and maximizing utility. Marginal utility refers to the extra utility resulting from the consumption of one extra unit of a commodity, the consumption of the rest of the goods remaining unaffected. Total utility is refers to as the number of units of utility that a consumer gains from consuming a given quantity of a good, service, or activity during a particular time period. The greater a consumers total utility, the larger the customer’s level of consumption. The cost to any firm of producing any output evidently depends upon the physical amounts of real resources. For instance material, labour and machine hours used in production. As the larger output needs a larger amount of resources, the total cost for larger output becomes high. Whereas the smaller output requires the smaller resources. The total cost for smaller output becomes smaller. A company can produce at lower cost when it produces better new techniques to products. Production with traditional and old method implicates high cost. The maximisation of returns includes the use of a definite technique to produce that can facilitate the optimal combination of factors. Production cost is defined as the expenditures by a business in producing a commodity. There are several kinds of cost concepts, these are marginal cost, total cost and average cost. Total is the cost of producing a certain output of the product in question. Total cost can be classified into variable cost and fixed cost. Fixed costs is also known as overhead cost. These are costs which do not differ with output. The costs will be the same whether the output is ten or twenty or a thousand of a product. Fixed costs entails interest on bank loans, depreciation of machinery, insurance charges and rent of factory. Variable costs are also called prime cost. Variable costs differ with alterations in output. The greater the output, the bigger the variable costs. Average cost is the cost of each unit of output and is achieved by dividing the total cost by the level of output. It is further divided into two parts, average fixed cost and average variable cost. Marginal cost is defined as the extra cost incurred by increasing output by one unit. It is the added cost of producing an additional unit of output. Perfect competition is a market structure in which the following characteristics are met. All businesses trade the same commodity, all firms will have a comparatively small market share, all firms are price takers meaning they cannot control the market price of their goods, the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit, and buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm. Perfect competition is a hypothetical market structure. Under perfect competition there are numerous buyers and sellers and prices reveal supply and demand. Customers will have several substitutes when the commodity they wish to buy quality begins to reduce or if it becomes more expensive. News firms can as well simply enter the market, leading to an extra competition. Monopoly on the other hand is where there is only one supplier in the market. For the reasons of regulation, monopoly power occurs where a single business owns 25% or more of a particular market. Monopolies can form for a number of reasons. For example, government can grant a business monopoly powers, if a firm has exclusive ownership of a limited resource, producers may have patents over designs for instance, giving them rights to trade a good or a service and a merger of two or more firms would create a monopoly. Monopolies have basic characteristics such as, they can maintain super normal returns in the long run, a monopolist with no substitute would be able to develop the greatest monopoly power and with no close substitutes, the monopolist can therefore derive supernormal profits.</p><p>In conclusion, microeconomics tries in any way not to explain what ought to happen in a market. Instead it will explains what to anticipate if some conditions are altered. For instance if producers increase the price of a commodity, customers will opt to purchase fewer of a product than before.</p><h2>Topics</h2><p>The study of microeconomics involves several key areas:</p><h3>Demand, supply, and equilibrium</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Main article: Supply and demand</p><p>Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market. It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.</p><h3>Measurement of elasticities</h3><p> Main article: Elasticity (economics)</p><p>Elasticity is the measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another variable. Elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable, when the later variable has a causal influence on the former. It is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable, or of the function that determines it, to changes in causative variables in unitless ways. Frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.</p><h3>Consumer demand theory</h3><p> Main article: Consumer choice</p><p>Consumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves. The link between personal preferences, consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics. It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints.</p><h3>Theory of production</h3><p> Main article: Production theory</p><p>Production theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs. Production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use, gift-giving in a gift economy, or exchange in a market economy. This can include manufacturing, storing, shipping, and packaging. Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption. They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production.</p><h3>Costs of production</h3><p> Main article: Cost-of-production theory of value</p><p>The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production: labour, capital, land. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (ex:plant) or circulating capital (ex:intermediate goods).</p><h3>Perfect competition</h3><p> Main article: Perfect competition</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Perfect competition describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as eBay, on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers.</p><p>Benefits of Perfect Competition- All the knowledge such as price and information pertaining goods is equally dispersed among all buyers and sellers. As there are no barriers to enter into the market, monopoly does not usually occur. As all goods and products are same, advertisement is not required and it helps save the advertisement cost.in perfect competition products are identical</p><h3>Monopoly</h3><p> Main article: monopoly</p><p>A monopoly (from Greek monos µ???? (alone or single) + polein p??e?? (to sell)) exists when a single company is the only supplier of a particular commodity.</p><p>Benefits of Monopoly Market- Prices in monopoly market are stable as there is only one firm and so there is no competition. Due to the absence of competition there are high profits and leads to high number of sales monopoly firms tend to receive super profits from their operations.</p><h3>Oligopoly</h3><p> Main article: Oligopoly</p><p>An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output.[5]</p><p>Benefits of oligopoly market-As there is less competition in the firm, it tends to have massive profit.It is also able to easily compare prices forces these companies to keep their prices in competition with the other companies involved in the market.Each company scrambles to come out with latest and greatest thing in order to sway consumers to go with their company over a different one.</p><h3>Market structure</h3><p>The market structure can have several types of interacting market systems. Different forms of markets are a feature of capitalism and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system.</p><p>Examples of markets include but are not limited to: commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, stock markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market.</p><h3>Game theory</h3><p> Main article: Game theory</p><p>Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. The term game here implies the study of any strategic interaction between people. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers &amp; acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design,and voting systems, and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Labour economics</h3><p> Main article: Labour economics</p><p>Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers), the demands of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, labour is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.</p><h3>Welfare economics</h3><p> Main article: Welfare economics</p><p>Welfare economics is a branch of economics that uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well-being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium.[7] It analyzes social welfare, however measured, in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no social welfare apart from the welfare associated with its individual units.</p><h3>Economics of information</h3><p> Main article: Information economics</p><p>Information economics or the economics of information is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions. Information has special characteristics. It is easy to create but hard to trust. It is easy to spread but hard to control. It influences many decisions. These special characteristics (as compared with other types of goods) complicate many standard economic theories.[8]</p><h2>Opportunity cost</h2><p> Main article: Opportunity cost</p><p>Opportunity cost of an activity (or goods) is equal to the best next alternative uses/forgone. Although opportunity cost can be hard to quantify, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real on the individual level. In fact, this principle applies to all decisions, not just economic ones.</p><p>Opportunity cost is one way to measure the cost of something. Rather than merely identifying and adding the costs of a project, one may also identify the next best alternative way to spend the same amount of money. The forgone profit of this next best alternative is the opportunity cost of the original choice. A common example is a farmer that chooses to farm their land rather than rent it to neighbors, wherein the opportunity cost is the forgone profit from renting. In this case, the farmer may expect to generate more profit alone. This kind of reasoning is a very important part of the calculation of discount rates in discounted cash flow investment valuation methodologies. Similarly, the opportunity cost of attending university is the lost wages a student could have earned in the workforce, rather than the cost of tuition, books, and other requisite items (whose sum makes up the total cost of attendance).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives, but rather the benefit of the single, best alternative. Possible opportunity costs of a city's decision to build a hospital on its vacant land are the loss of the land for a sporting center, or the inability to use the land for a parking lot, or the money that could have been made from selling the land, or the loss of any of the various other possible uses — but not all of these in aggregate. The true opportunity cost would be the forgone profit of the most lucrative of those listed.</p><p>One question that arises here is how to determine a money value for each alternative to facilitate comparison and assess opportunity cost, which may be more or less difficult depending on the things we are trying to compare. For example, many decisions involve environmental impacts whose monetary value is difficult to assess because of scientific uncertainty. Valuing a human life or the economic impact of an Arctic oil spill involves making subjective choices with ethical implications.</p><p>It is imperative to understand that no decision on allocating time is free. No matter what one chooses to do, they are always giving something up in return. An example of opportunity cost is deciding between going to a concert and doing homework. If one decides to go the concert, then they are giving up valuable time to study, but if they choose to do homework then the cost is giving up the concert. Any decision in allocating capital is likewise: there is an opportunity cost of capital, or a hurdle rate, defined as the expected rate one could get by investing in similar projects on the open market. Opportunity cost is vital in understanding microeconomics and decisions that are made.</p><h2>Applied</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg/220px-United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg" width="220" height="146"><p>

			Applied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study, many of which draw on methods from other fields. Industrial organization examines topics such as the entry and exit of firms, innovation, and the role of trademarks. Labor economics examines wages, employment, and labor market dynamics. Financial economics examines topics such as the structure of optimal portfolios, the rate of return to capital, econometric analysis of security returns, and corporate financial behavior. Public economics examines the design of government tax and expenditure policies and economic effects of these policies (e.g., social insurance programs). Political economy examines the role of political institutions in determining policy outcomes. Health economics examines the organization of health care systems, including the role of the health care workforce and health insurance programs. Education economics examines the organization of education provision and its implication for efficiency and equity, including the effects of education on productivity. Urban economics, which examines the challenges faced by cities, such as sprawl, air and water pollution, traffic congestion, and poverty, draws on the fields of urban geography and sociology. Law and economics applies microeconomic principles to the selection and enforcement of competing legal regimes and their relative efficiencies. Economic history examines the evolution of the economy and economic institutions, using methods and techniques from the fields of economics, history, geography, sociology, psychology, and political science.</p><p>&lt;ref&gt;==References==</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microeconomics&amp;oldid=783350389"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><h1 lang="en">Rational choice theory</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p> This article is about a theory of economics. For rational choice theory as applied to criminology, see Rational choice theory (criminology).</p><p>Rational choice theory, also known as choice theory or rational action theory, is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behavior.[1] The basic premise of rational choice theory is that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions. The theory also focuses on the determinants of the individual choices (methodological individualism).</p><p>Rational choice theory then assumes that an individual has preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.</p><p>Rationality is widely used as an assumption of the behavior of individuals in microeconomic models and analyses and appears in almost all economics textbook treatments of human decision-making. It is also used in political science,[2] sociology,[3] and philosophy. A particular version of rationality is instrumental rationality, which involves seeking the most cost-effective means to achieve a specific goal without reflecting on the worthiness of that goal. Gary Becker was an early proponent of applying rational actor models more widely.[4] Becker won the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his studies of discrimination, crime, and human capital.[5]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definition and scope</h2><p>The concept of rationality used in rational choice theory is different from the colloquial and most philosophical use of the word. Colloquially, rational behaviour typically means sensible, predictable, or in a thoughtful, clear-headed manner. Rational choice theory uses a narrower definition of rationality. At its most basic level, behavior is rational if it is goal-oriented, reflective (evaluative), and consistent (across time and different choice situations). This contrasts with behavior that is random, impulsive, conditioned, or adopted by (unevaluative) imitation.[citation needed]</p><p>Early neoclassical economists writing about rational choice, including William Stanley Jevons, assumed that agents make consumption choices so as to maximize their happiness, or utility. Contemporary theory bases rational choice on a set of choice axioms that need to be satisfied, and typically does not specify where the goal (preferences, desires) comes from. It mandates just a consistent ranking of the alternatives.[6]:501 Individuals choose the best action according to their personal preferences and the constraints facing them. E.g., there is nothing irrational in preferring fish to meat the first time, but there is something irrational in preferring fish to meat in one instant and preferring meat to fish in another, without anything else having changed.</p><p>Rational choice theorists do not claim that the theory describes the choice process, but rather that it predicts the outcome and pattern of choices. An assumption often added to the rational choice paradigm is that individual preferences are self-interested, in which case the individual can be referred to as a homo economicus. Such an individual acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage.[7] Proponents of such models, particularly those associated with the Chicago school of economics, do not claim that a model's assumptions are an accurate description of reality, only that they help formulate clear and falsifiable hypotheses.[citation needed] In this view, the only way to judge the success of a hypothesis is empirical tests.[7] To use an example from Milton Friedman, if a theory that says that the behavior of the leaves of a tree is explained by their rationality passes the empirical test, it is seen as successful.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg" width="150" height="179"><p>Without specifying the individual's goal or preferences it may not be possible to empirically test, or falsify, the rationality assumption. However, the predictions made by a specific version of the theory are testable. In recent years, the most prevalent version of rational choice theory, expected utility theory, has been challenged by the experimental results of behavioral economics. Economists are learning from other fields, such as psychology, and are enriching their theories of choice in order to get a more accurate view of human decision-making. For example, the behavioral economist and experimental psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for his work in this field.</p><p>Rational choice theory has become increasingly employed in social sciences other than economics, such as sociology, evolutionary theory and political science in recent decades.[8][9] It has had far-reaching impacts on the study of political science, especially in fields like the study of interest groups, elections, behaviour in legislatures, coalitions, and bureaucracy.[10] In these fields, the use of the rational choice paradigm to explain broad social phenomena is the subject of active controversy.[11][12]</p><h2>Actions, assumptions, and individual preferences</h2><p>The premise of rational choice theory as a social science methodology is that the aggregate behavior in society reflects the sum of the choices made by individuals. Each individual, in turn, makes their choice based on their own preferences and the constraints (or choice set) they face.</p><p>At the individual level, rational choice theory stipulates that the agent chooses the action (or outcome) they most prefer. In the case where actions (or outcomes) can be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, a rational individual chooses the action (or outcome) that provides the maximum net benefit, i.e., the maximum benefit minus cost.</p><p>The theory applies to more general settings than those identified by costs and benefit. In general, rational decision making entails choosing among all available alternatives the alternative that the individual most prefers. The alternatives can be a set of actions (what to do?) or a set of objects (what to choose/buy). In the case of actions, what the individual really cares about are the outcomes that results from each possible action. Actions, in this case, are only an instrument for obtaining a particular outcome.</p><h3>Formal statement</h3><p>The available alternatives are often expressed as a set of objects, for example a set of j exhaustive and exclusive actions:</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rational_choice_theory&amp;oldid=770556981"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Normative economics</h1><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Normative economics (as opposed to positive economics) is a part of economics that expresses value or normative judgments about economic fairness or what the outcome of the economy or goals of public policy ought to be.[1]</p><p>Economists commonly prefer to distinguish normative economics (what ought to be in economic matters) from positive economics (what is). Many normative (value) judgments, however, are held conditionally, to be given up if facts or knowledge of facts changes, so that a change of values may be purely scientific.[2] On the other hand, welfare economist Amartya Sen distinguishes basic (normative) judgments, which do not depend on such knowledge, from nonbasic judgments, which do. He finds it interesting to note that no judgments are demonstrably basic while some value judgments may be shown to be nonbasic. This leaves open the possibility of fruitful scientific discussion of value judgments.[3]</p><p>Positive and normative economics are often synthesized in the style of practical idealism. In this discipline, sometimes called the art of economics, positive economics is utilized as a practical tool for achieving normative objectives.</p><p>An example of a normative economic statement is as follows:</p><p>This is a normative statement, because it reflects value judgments. This specific statement makes the judgment that farmers need a higher living standard and that family farms need to be saved.[1]</p><p>Subfields of normative economics include social choice theory, cooperative game theory, and mechanism design.</p><p>Some earlier technical problems posed in welfare economics and the theory of justice have been sufficiently addressed as to leave room for consideration of proposals in applied fields such as resource allocation, public policy, social indicators, and inequality and poverty measurement.[4]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Normative_economics&amp;oldid=782036831"

					</p><br><h1 lang="en">Business economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Business economics is a field in applied economics which uses economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze business enterprises and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, capital and product markets.[1] A professional focus of the journal Business Economics has been expressed as providing practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Subject matter</h2><p>Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why corporate firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.[1]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Ambiguity in the use of term</h2><p>The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/industrial organisation, managerial economics, and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly. One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with industry but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.[3] Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.[4]</p><h2>Interpretations from various universities</h2><p>Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.[5] The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at University of Delhi is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.[6]</p><p>The program at Harvard University uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including business administration, management, and related fields of business economics.[7]</p><p>The University of Miami defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.[8]</p><p>Courses at the University of Manchester interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural theory of the firm; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the structure, conduct and performance of business at the industry level.[9]</p><p>Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of Gino Zappa, for example a standard course[10] at the Politecnico di Milano involves studying corporate governance, accounting, investment analysis, budgeting and business strategy.</p><p>La Trobe University of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.</p><h2>Notes</h2><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_economics&amp;oldid=771210217"

It can be contrasted to heterodox economics, which are various schools or approaches that are only accepted by their expositors, with little influence on the majority of academic economists. Mainstream economics has been associated with neoclassical economics[1] and with the neoclassical synthesis, which combines neoclassical methods and a Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>United States</h2><p>In the United States, mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary economic schools of thought have been the saltwater and freshwater schools. In the early 1970s, so-called fresh-water economists challenged the prevailing consensus in macroeconomics research. Key elements of their approach were that macroeconomics had to be dynamic, quantitative, and based on how individuals and institutions make decisions under uncertainty. Many of the proponents of this radically new approach to macroeconomics were associated with Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester and the University of Minnesota. They were referred to as the freshwater school since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester, and Minneapolis are located nearer to the Great Lakes. The established consensus was primarily defended by economists at the universities and other institutions located near the east and west coast of the United States, such as Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, and Yale. They were therefore often referred to as the saltwater schools. Today, mainstream economists do not, in general, identify themselves as members of a particular school.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Economics has always featured multiple schools of economic thought, with different schools having different prominence across countries and over time. The current use of the term mainstream economics is specific to the post–World War II era, particularly in the English-speaking world, and to a lesser extent globally.</p><p>Prior to the development of modern academic economics, the dominant school in Europe was mercantilism, which was rather a loose set of related ideas than an institutionalized school. With the development of modern economics, conventionally given as the late 18th-century The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, British economics developed and became dominated by what is now called the classical school. From The Wealth of Nations until the Great Depression, the dominant school within the English-speaking world was classical economics, and its successor, neoclassical economics.[3] In continental Europe, the earlier work of the physiocrats in France formed a distinct tradition, as did the later work of the historical school of economics in Germany, and throughout the 19th century there were debates in British economics, notably the opposition underconsumptionist school.</p><p>During the Great Depression and the following Second World War, the school of Keynesian economics gained prominence, which built on the work of the underconsumptionist school, and present-day mainstream economics stems from the neoclassical synthesis, which was the post–World War II merger of Keynesian macroeconomics and neoclassical microeconomics.</p><p>In continental Europe, by contrast, Keynesian economics was rejected, with German thought dominated by the Freiburg school, whose political philosophy of ordoliberalism formed the intellectual basis of Germany's post-war social market economy. Within developing economies, which formed the majority of the world's population, various schools of development economics have been influential.</p><p>Since 2007, the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the ensuing global economic crisis has publicly exposed divisions within mainstream economics and significantly intensified controversy about its status, with some arguing for radical overhaul or rejection of mainstream economics, others arguing for evolutionary change, and others still arguing that mainstream economics explains the crisis.[4]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Term</h3><p>The term mainstream economics came into common use in the late 20th century. It appears in 2001 edition of the seminal textbook Economics by Samuelson and Nordhaus[5] on the inside back cover in the Family Tree of Economics, which depicts arrows into Modern Mainstream Economics from J.M. Keynes (1936) and neoclassical economics (1860–1910). The term neoclassical synthesis itself also first appears in the 1955 edition of Samuelson's textbook.[6]</p><h2>Scope</h2><p>Mainstream economics can be defined, as distinct from other schools of economics, by various criteria, notably by its assumptions, its methods, and its topics.</p><h3>Assumptions</h3><p>A number of assumptions may underpin many mainstream economic models, while being rejected by some heterodox schools. These include the neoclassical assumptions of rational choice theory, a representative agent, and, often, rational expectations. Much of modern economic modelling consists of exploring the effects that complicating factors have on models, such as imperfect and asymmetric information, incomplete markets, imperfect competition and transaction costs.</p><p>The starting point of orthodox economic analysis is the individual. People are generally defined as units with a common goal: maximisation through rational behaviour. The only differences consist of:</p><p>From this theoretical framework, orthodox economists derive that political action should not be used to solve the problems of the economic system. Instead, the solution ought to derive from an intervention on the above-mentioned maximisation objectives and constraints. It is in this context that economic capitalism finds its justification. Capitalism and its arguments seem logical because orthodox economics theories think of the aggregate economy as the sum of the agents trying to maximise their utility or profit through exchange.[7]</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Mainstream economics has also been defined methodologically as work which mainstream economists are willing to engage, which requires conforming to the mainstream language of mathematical models,[8] featuring calculus, optimization, and comparative statics. Under this definition, areas of thought which are typically thought of as heterodox because they do not work under the typical neoclassical assumptions, such as econophysics, behavioral economics, and evolutionary economics, can be considered mainstream when they are engaged in the mainstream, using mainstream methods.[8] Geoffrey Hodgson has considered the possibility that evolutionary economics and institutional economics may eventually become a new mainstream.[9]</p><p>Additionally, some economic fields include elements of both mainstream economics and heterodox economics: for example, the Austrian economics[how?],[10] institutional economics, neuroeconomics and non-linear complexity theory.[11] They may use neoclassical economics as a point of departure. At least one institutionalist has argued that neoclassical economics no longer dominates a mainstream economics.[12]</p><p>A countervailing trend is the expansion of mainstream methods to such seemingly distant fields as crime, the family, law, politics, and religion. The latter phenomenon is sometimes referred to as economic imperialism.[13]</p><h3>Topics</h3><p>Mainstream economics includes theories of market and government failure and private and public goods. These developments suggest a range of views on the desirability or otherwise of government intervention.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>Since the financial crisis of 2007–2010, considerable conflict has arisen, among both economic theorists and a wider cross-section of the public, regarding the status and future of mainstream economics.[4][14] Some critics have argued that potentially promising approaches have been excluded in major mainstream publications by a focus on problems amenable to formal modeling.[15][16]</p><p>Chartalists, who are generally considered part of the Post-Keynesian school of thought, criticise mainstream theory as failing to describe the actual mechanics of modern fiat monetary economies. Chartalism focuses on a detailed understanding of the way money actually flows through the different sectors of an economy. Specifically, Chartalism focuses on the interaction between central banks, treasury and the private banking system. Chartalism rejects critical mainstream theories such as the loanable funds market, the money multiplier, and the utility of fiscal austerity.</p><p>Some economists, in the vein of ecological economics, believe that the neoclassical holy trinity of rationality, greed, and equilibrium, is being replaced by the holy trinity of purposeful behavior, enlightened self-interest, and sustainability, considerably broadening the scope of what is mainstream.[8] Ecological economics addresses sustainability issues, such as public goods, natural capital and negative externalities (such as pollution).[17]</p><p>Energy related theories of economic concepts also exist within energy economics relating to thermodynamic concepts of economic thinking, such as energy accounting.[18] Biophysical economics relates to this area.[19]</p><h3>Survey articles</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mainstream_economics&amp;oldid=783714535"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Green economy</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>The green economy is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus.[1][2] The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive. [3]</p><p>A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital) and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.[4]</p><p>Green Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Green economists and economics</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the ecology movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to some equally ill-defined mainstream economics.[citation needed]</p><p>The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capital-G Green term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of 'green economists' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson's presentation of these.)[citation needed]</p><p>Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as canals). Or, it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.[citation needed]</p><p>An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of green economics. As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank[5] and International Monetary Fund (via its Green Fund initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance.[citation needed] Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives.[citation needed] The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that [b]ased on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation.

It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:</p><h2>Ecological measurements</h2><p>Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of economic index indicators.

The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives.[citation needed] However, other experts[13] argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years.[14] Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, Towards a Green Economy,[15] while well-intentioned ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.[16] Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and green growth in particular, based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change and may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions.[17] Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,[18] and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis.[19] He has also criticised the UN's project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB),[20] and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Notes and references</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_economy&amp;oldid=781971723"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><p>Michael Grossman's 1972 model of health production[8] has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable. Grossman's model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health. Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of investments in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of capital. The model acknowledges that health is both a consumption good that yields direct satisfaction and utility, and an investment good, which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman's 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.</p><p>In Grossman's model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the marginal cost of health capital is equal to the marginal benefit. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate d. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: 
		  
			
			  
				M
				
				  C
				  
					H
					K
				  
				
				=
				r
				+
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle MC_{HK}=r+\delta \,}
		  
		. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, 
		  
			
			  
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle \delta \,}
		  
		 increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock. The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.</p><p>Beyond issues of the fundamental, real demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the marginal benefit of medical care (which is always associated with this real demand curve based on derived demand), and a separate effective demand curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices. Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price. The consumer sets MB=MC out of pocket, and so the effective demand will have a separate relationship between price and quantity than will the marginal benefit curve or real demand relationship. This distinction is often described under the rubric of ex-post moral hazard (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).</p><h2>Health technology assessment</h2><p>Economic evaluation, and in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen – IQWiG) in Germany and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.</p><p>Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of cost–utility analysis (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the Quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</p><h2>Healthcare markets</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The five health markets typically analyzed are:</p><p>Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created risk pools in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with adverse selection which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection (cherry-picking), and preexisting condition exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.</p><p>Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting moral hazard drives up costs, as shown by the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.</p><p>Consumers in healthcare markets often suffer from a lack of adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with supplier induced demand, whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial practice variations, whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.</p><p>Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.[9]</p><h2>Other issues</h2><h3>Medical economics</h3><p>Often used synonymously with health economics, medical economics, according to Culyer,[10] is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses mathematical models to synthesise data from biostatistics and epidemiology for support of medical decision-making, both for individuals and for wider health policy.</p><h3>Behavioral economics</h3><p>Peter Orszag has suggested that behavioral economics is an important factor for improving the healthcare system, but that relatively little progress has been made when compared to retirement policy.[11]</p><h3>Mental health economics</h3><p>Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from pharmacoeconomics to labor economics and welfare economics. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children.[12] Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home.[13] In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.[14]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual's potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture presenteeism, when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.[13]</p><p>Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral.[15] Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of knowledge brokers.[13]</p><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;oldid=783361465"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Public choice</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Public choice or public choice theory refers to the use of economic tools to deal with traditional problems of political science.[1] Its content includes the study of political behavior. In political science, it is the subset of positive political theory that studies self-interested agents (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained utility maximization, game theory, or decision theory.[1] Public-choice analysis has roots in positive analysis (what is) but is often used for normative purposes (what ought to be) in order to identify a problem or to suggest improvements to constitutional rules (i.e., constitutional economics).[1][2][3]</p><p>The Journal of Economic Literature's classification code regards public choice as a subarea of microeconomics, under JEL: D7: Analysis of Collective Decision-Making (specifically, JEL: D72: Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).[4] Public choice theory is also closely related to social-choice theory, a mathematical approach to aggregation of individual interests, welfares, or votes.[5] Much early work had aspects of both, and both fields use the tools of economics and game theory. Since voter behavior influences the behavior of public officials, public-choice theory often uses results from social-choice theory. General treatments of public choice may also be classified under public economics.[6]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background and development</h2><p>A precursor of modern public choice theory was the work of Knut Wicksell (1896),[7] which treated government as political exchange, a quid pro quo, in formulating a benefit principle linking taxes and expenditures.[8]</p><p>Some subsequent economic analysis has been described as treating government as though it attempted to maximize some kind sort of welfare function for society and as distinct from characterizations of economic agents, such as those in business.[1] In contrast, public choice theory modeled government as made up of officials who, besides pursuing the public interest, might act to benefit themselves, for example in the budget-maximizing model of bureaucracy, possibly at the cost of efficiency.[1][9]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Modern public-choice theory has been dated from the work of Duncan Black, sometimes called the founding father of public choice.[10] In a series of papers from 1948, which culminated in The Theory of Committees and Elections (1958),[11] and later, Black outlined a program of unification toward a more general Theory of Economic and Political Choices based on common formal methods,[12] developed underlying concepts of what would become median voter theory, and rediscovered earlier works on voting theory.[13][1][14]</p><p>Kenneth J. Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values (1951) influenced formulation of the theory. Among other important works are Anthony Downs (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy and Mancur Olson (1965) The Logic of Collective Action.[15]</p><p>James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock coauthored The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy (1962), considered one of the landmarks in public choice. In particular, the preface describes the book as about the political organization of a free society. But its methodology, conceptual apparatus, and analytics are derived, essentially, from the discipline that has as its subject the economic organization of such a society (1962, p. v). The book focuses on positive-economic analysis as to the development of constitutional democracy but in an ethical context of consent. The consent takes the form of a compensation principle like Pareto efficiency for making a policy change and unanimity or at least no opposition as a point of departure for social choice.</p><p>Somewhat later, the probabilistic voting theory started to displace the median voter theory in showing how to find Nash equilibria in multidimensional space. The theory was later formalized further by Peter Coughlin.[16]</p><h2>Decision-making processes and the state</h2><p>One way to organize the subject matter studied by public choice theorists is to begin with the foundations of the state itself. According to this procedure, the most fundamental subject is the origin of government. Although some work has been done on anarchy, autocracy, revolution, and even war, the bulk of the study in this area has concerned the fundamental problem of collectively choosing constitutional rules. This work assumes a group of individuals who aim to form a government, then it focuses on the problem of hiring the agents required to carry out government functions agreed upon by the members.[citation needed]</p><h2>Expressive interests and democratic irrationality</h2><p>Geoffrey Brennan and Loren Lomasky claim that democratic policy is biased to favor expressive interests and neglect practical and utilitarian considerations. Brennan and Lomasky differentiate between instrumental interests (any kind of practical benefit, both monetary and non-monetary) and expressive interests (forms of expression like applause). According to Brennan and Lomasky, the voting paradox can be resolved by differentiating between expressive and instrumental interests.</p><p>This argument has led some public choice scholars to claim that politics is plagued by irrationality. In articles published in the Econ Journal Watch, economist Bryan Caplan contended that voter choices and government economic decisions are inherently irrational.[17][18] Caplan's ideas are more fully developed in his book The Myth of the Rational Voter (Princeton University Press 2007). Countering Donald Wittman's arguments in The Myth of Democratic Failure, Caplan claims that politics is biased in favor of irrational beliefs.</p><p>According to Caplan, democracy effectively subsidizes irrational beliefs. Anyone who derives utility from potentially irrational policies like protectionism can receive private benefits while imposing the costs of such beliefs on the general public. Were people to bear the full costs of their irrational beliefs, they would lobby for them optimally, taking into account both their instrumental consequences and their expressive appeal. Instead, democracy oversupplies policies based on irrational beliefs. Caplan defines rationality mainly in terms of mainstream price theory, pointing out that mainstream economists tend to oppose protectionism and government regulation more than the general population, and that more educated people are closer to economists on this score, even after controlling for confounding factors such as income, wealth or political affiliation. One criticism is that many economists do not share Caplan's views on the nature of public choice. However, Caplan does have data to support his position. Economists have, in fact, often been frustrated by public opposition to economic reasoning. As Sam Peltzman puts it:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Economists know what steps would improve the efficiency of HSE [health, safety, and environmental] regulation, and they have not been bashful advocates of them. These steps include substituting markets in property rights, such as emission rights, for command and control...The real problem lies deeper than any lack of reform proposals or failure to press them. It is our inability to understand their lack of political appeal.[19]</p><p>Public choice's application to government regulation was developed by George Stigler (1971) and Sam Peltzman (1976).</p><h2>Special interests</h2><p>Public choice theory is often used to explain how political decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many advocacy group and pork barrel projects are not the desire of the overall democracy. However, it makes sense for politicians to support these projects. It may make them feel powerful and important. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as lobbyists. The project may be of interest to the politician's local constituency, increasing district votes or campaign contributions. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally. They can gain government favors worth millions or billions for relatively small investments. They face a risk of losing out to their competitors if they don't seek these favors. The taxpayer is also behaving rationally. The cost of defeating any one government give-away is very high, while the benefits to the individual taxpayer are very small. Each citizen pays only a few pennies or a few dollars for any given government favor, while the costs of ending that favor would be many times higher. Everyone involved has rational incentives to do exactly what they are doing, even though the desire of the general constituency is opposite. Costs are diffused, while benefits are concentrated. The voices of vocal minorities with much to gain are heard over those of indifferent majorities with little to individually lose.[20][21] However the notion that groups with concentrated interests will dominate politics is incomplete because it is only one half of political equilibrium. Something must incite those preyed upon to resist even the best organized concentrated interests. In his article on interest groups Gary Becker identified this countervailing force as being the deadweight loss from predation. His views capped what has come to be known as the Chicago school of political economy and it has come in sharp conflict with the so-called Virginia faction of public choice due to its assertion that politics will tend towards efficiency due to nonlinear deadweight losses and due to its claim that political efficiency renders policy advice irrelevant.[22]</p><p>While good government tends to be a pure public good for the mass of voters, there may be many advocacy groups that have strong incentives for lobbying the government to implement specific policies that would benefit them, potentially at the expense of the general public. For example, lobbying by the sugar manufacturers might result in an inefficient subsidy for the production of sugar, either direct or by protectionist measures. The costs of such inefficient policies are dispersed over all citizens, and therefore unnoticeable to each individual. On the other hand, the benefits are shared by a small special-interest group with a strong incentive to perpetuate the policy by further lobbying. Due to rational ignorance, the vast majority of voters will be unaware of the effort; in fact, although voters may be aware of special-interest lobbying efforts, this may merely select for policies which are even harder to evaluate by the general public, rather than improving their overall efficiency. Even if the public were able to evaluate policy proposals effectively, they would find it infeasible to engage in collective action in order to defend their diffuse interest. Therefore, theorists expect that numerous special interests will be able to successfully lobby for various inefficient policies. In public choice theory, such scenarios of inefficient government policies are referred to as government failure – a term akin to market failure from earlier theoretical welfare economics.[20]</p><h2>Rent-seeking</h2><p>A field that is closely related to public choice is rent-seeking. This field combines the study of a market economy with that of government. Thus, one might regard it as a new political economy. Its basic thesis is that when both a market economy and government are present, government agents provide numerous special market privileges. Both the government agents and self-interested market participants seek these privileges in order to partake in the resulting monopoly rent. Rentiers gain benefits above what the market would have offered, but in the process allocate resources in sub-optimal fashion from a societal point of view.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Rent-seeking is broader than public choice in that it applies to autocracies as well as democracies and, therefore, is not directly concerned with collective decision making. However, the obvious pressures it exerts on legislators, executives, bureaucrats, and even judges are factors that public choice theory must account for in its analysis of collective decision-making rules and institutions. Moreover, the members of a collective who are planning a government would be wise to take prospective rent-seeking into account.[21]</p><p>Another major claim is that much of political activity is a form of rent-seeking which wastes resources. Gordon Tullock, Jagdish Bhagwati, and Anne Osborn Krueger have argued that rent-seeking has caused considerable waste.[21] In a parallel line of research Fred McChesney claims that rent extraction causes considerable waste, especially in the developing world. As the term implies, rent extraction happens when officials use threats to extort payments from private parties.</p><h2>Bureaucracy</h2><p>Another major sub-field is the study of bureaucracy. The usual model depicts the top bureaucrats as being chosen by the chief executive and legislature, depending on whether the democratic system is presidential or parliamentary. The typical image of a bureau chief is a person on a fixed salary who is concerned with pleasing those who appointed him. The latter have the power to hire and fire him more or less at will. The bulk of the bureaucrats, however, are civil servants whose jobs and pay are protected by a civil service system against major changes by their appointed bureau chiefs. This image is often compared with that of a business owner whose profit varies with the success of production and sales, who aims to maximize profit, and who can in an ideal system hire and fire employees at will.[9] William Niskanen is generally considered the founder of public choice literature on the bureaucracy.[9]</p><h2>Political stance</h2><p>From such results it is sometimes asserted that public choice theory has an anti-state tilt. But there is ideological diversity among public choice theorists. Mancur Olson for example was an advocate of a strong state and instead opposed political interest group lobbying.[15] More generally, James Buchanan has suggested that public choice theory be interpreted as politics without romance, a critical approach to a pervasive earlier notion of idealized politics set against market failure.[23]</p><p>The British journalist, Alistair Cooke, commenting on the Nobel Prize awarded to James M. Buchanan in 1986, reportedly summarized the public choice view of politicians by saying, Public choice embodies the homely but important truth that politicians are, after all, no less selfish than the rest of us.[24]</p><h2>Recognition</h2><p>Several notable public choice scholars have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, including James M. Buchanan (1986), George Stigler (1982), Gary Becker (1992), Vernon Smith (2002) and Elinor Ostrom (2009). In addition, Vernon Smith and Elinor Ostrom were former presidents of the Public Choice Society.[25]</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>In their 1994 book Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory, political scientists Donald P. Green and Ian Shapiro argue that rational choice theory (of which public choice theory is a branch) has contributed less to the field than its popularity suggests.[26] They write:</p><p>Linda McQuaig writes in All You Can Eat:[citation needed]</p><p>Amartya Sen has acknowledged the contribution of Buchanan and Tullock's analysis of unanimity as a criterion for collective choice,[28] but argued for the logical inconsistency of the Pareto-principle version of unanimity with even minimal liberty in a social-choice framework.[29] More broadly he qualified its use when other information besides personal utility is given a weight in public judgments.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Buchanan and Tullock themselves outline methodological qualifications of the approach developed in their work The Calculus of Consent (1962), p. 30:</p><p>The reach of public choice theory might be even wider than Buchanan and Tullock indicate. Some theory shows that relaxing the assumption of self-interest leaves many public choice problems in place (although sometimes in altered from). As long as political actors are rational maximizers who disagree about the objectives government should pursue, public choice problems persist even if the disagreement stems from adherence to competing ethical principles rather than from competing self-interested wants.[31]</p><h3>New Ideas and Policy Innovation rather than Self Interest</h3><p>Another criticism suggests that some of the great developments in politics and policy have not been a product of individual actor's vested self interests, but rather because of new ideas. New ideas, by virtue of being innovative, expand the policy choices on the menu outside of simple vested interests and allow for equilibriums which were previously not possible. Dani Rodrik of the Harvard Kennedy School provides several examples of this phenomenon, where both Elites and Non-Elites were made better off through policy innovation, or in the case of the democratization of South Africa, making commitments to avoid Hold-up problems.[32]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_choice&amp;oldid=780790157"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Institutional economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behaviour. Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen's instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the ceremonial sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 American Economic Review article by Walton H. Hamilton.[1][2]</p><p>Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics.[3]</p><p>A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the Legal Foundations of Capitalism by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there is heated debate on the role of law (formal institution) on economic growth.[4] Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior.</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assume stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium). It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons.[5] Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically-bounded social system; other institutionalist economists[who?] disagree with Marx's definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals.</p><p>Traditional institutionalism rejects the reduction of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy).[6] Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world-views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley.)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The vacillations of institutions are necessarily a result of the very incentives created by such institutions, and are thus endogenous. Emphatically, traditional institutionalism is in many ways a response to the current economic orthodoxy; its reintroduction in the form of institutionalist political economy is thus an explicit challenge to neoclassical economics, since it is based on the fundamental premise that neoclassicists oppose: that economics cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded.</p><p>Some of the authors associated with this school include Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Mark Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Thorstein Veblen</h2><p> Main articles: Thorstein Veblen and The Theory of the Leisure Class</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Veblen3a.jpg/220px-Veblen3a.jpg" width="220" height="288"><p>


		Thorstein Veblen came from a Norwegian immigrant family in rural Mid-western America.


		</p><p>
			Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929) wrote his first and most influential book while he was at the University of Chicago, on The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899).[7] In it he analyzed the motivation in capitalism to conspicuously consume their riches as a way of demonstrating success. Conspicuous leisure was another focus of Veblen's critique. The concept of conspicuous consumption was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.</p><p>In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of profiteering, did not advocate change.</p><p>Through the 1920s and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Thorstein Veblen's warnings of the tendency for wasteful consumption and the necessity of creating sound financial institutions seemed to ring true. Veblen remains a leading critic, which cautions against the excesses of the American way.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1898 an article entitled Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science[8] and he became the precursor of current evolutionary economics.</p><h2>John R. Commons</h2><p> Main article: John R. Commons</p><p>John R. Commons (1862–1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in Institutional Economics (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes.</p><p>Commons thought that government should be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.</p><h2>Wesley Mitchell</h2><p> Main article: Wesley Mitchell</p><p>Wesley Clair Mitchell (August 5, 1874 – October 29, 1948) was an American economist known for his empirical work on business cycles and for guiding the National Bureau of Economic Research in its first decades. Mitchell’s teachers included economists Thorstein Veblen and J. L. Laughlin and philosopher John Dewey.</p><h2>Clarence Ayres</h2><p> Main article: Clarence Edwin Ayres</p><p>Clarence Ayres (May 6, 1891 – July 24, 1972) was the principal thinker of what some has called the Texas school of institutional economics. Ayres developed on the ideas of Thorstein Veblen with a dichotomy of technology and institutions to separate the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structures. He claimed that technology was always one step ahead of the socio-cultural institutions.</p><p>It can be argued that Ayres was not an institutionalist in any normal sense of the term; since he identified institutions with sentiments and superstition and in consequence institutions only played a kind of residual role in this theory of development which core center was that of technology. Ayres was under strong influence of Hegel and institutions for Ayres had the same function as Schein (with the connotation of deception, and illusion) for Hegel. A more appropriate name for Ayres' position would be that of a techno-behaviorist rather than an institutionalist.</p><h2>Adolf Berle</h2><p> Main article: Adolf Berle</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg/220px-Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg" width="220" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr.


		</p><p id="lastLine">
			Adolf A. Berle (1895–1971) was one of the first authors to combine legal and economic analysis, and his work stands as a foundig pillar of thought in modern corporate governance. Like Keynes, Berle was at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but subsequently resigned from his diplomatic job dissatisfied with the Versailles Treaty terms. In his book with Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account.</p><p>Directors of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered.</p><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Delaware Valley</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

				This article is about the Philadelphia metropolitan area. For other uses, see Delaware Valley (disambiguation).</p><p>The Delaware Valley is the valley through which the Delaware River flows. By extension, this toponym is commonly used to refer to Greater Philadelphia or Philadelphia metropolitan area (the [Lower] Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area), which straddles the Lower Delaware River just north of its estuary. The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is located at the southern part of the Northeast megalopolis and as such, the Delaware Valley can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is composed of several counties in southeastern Pennsylvania and southwestern New Jersey, one county in northern Delaware and one county in northeastern Maryland. The MSA has a population of over 6 million, while the CSA has a population of over 7.1 million (as of the 2010 Census Bureau count). Philadelphia, being the region's major commercial, cultural, and industrial center, wields a rather large sphere of influence that affects the counties that immediately surround it.</p><p>Some of the Delaware Valley's most well-known contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education and medical institutions. The Delaware Valley has been influential upon American history and industry. The region are leaders in higher education, biotechnology, medicine, tourism and many others. With a gross domestic product of $388&nbsp;billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation.[3]</p><p>The area has hosted many people and sites significant to American culture and history, particularly in the arts, where Philadelphia alone has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city[4], politics, including many influential people involved in politics such as Benjamin Franklin and Joe Biden, and the American Revolution. Philadelphia is famously known as The Birthplace of America[5] as the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were both drafted and signed there. On December&nbsp;7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution, and has since promoted itself as The First State.[6]</p><p>The Delaware Valley was home many other instrumental moments in the American Revolution , including the First and Second Continental Congress, the preservation of the Liberty Bell, the Battles of Germantown, Brandywine, and Red Bank, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, the winter of 1777–78 at Valley Forge, the Philadelphia Convention, and many others. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today, the area is home to some of the most prestigious universities in the world, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, and Temple University.[7] The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is consistently ranked as the best business school in the world.[8]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>In geology and geography, a strict sense of the term would incorporate the Delaware River's main drainage basin, and so encompass major tributaries such as the Schuylkill River and Lehigh River and their valleys or sub-basins. These extensions also apply culturally with decreasing degree gradually decreased by proximal distance because the ease of land travel enables a great deal of daily interaction; for example, the large number of commuters who travel daily 45–90 minutes creates cultural blends and parallel values.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/DelawareRiverBasin-01.png/200px-DelawareRiverBasin-01.png" width="200" height="232"><br><p>The drainage basin of the Delaware River.</p><h2>Population and economy[edit]</h2><p>As of March 2011, the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD Metropolitan Statistical Area[9] constitutes the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States.[10][11][12] Its CSA ranks 8th.</p><p>Based on commuter flows, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also defines a wider labor market region that adds Berks County, Pennsylvania to the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, bringing the total metropolitan population to 6.53 million.</p><p>Philadelphia's media market ranks fourth, behind New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, in Nielsen Media Market size rankings. It also borders the New York metropolitan area located directly to the north of this area.</p><p>Such educational institutions as Delaware Valley Regional High School in Alexandria Township and Delaware Valley College in Doylestown Township are named after the region.

Within the Hispanic population, the vast majority are Puerto Ricans, though other groups include Dominicans and Mexicans.[17] There is a significant West Indian community. There is even a small Native American community known as Lenapehoking for Lenni-Lenape Indians of West Philadelphia.</p><p>Philadelphia's suburbs contain a high concentration of malls, the two largest of which have at least 5,000,000 square feet (460,000&nbsp;m2) of office space, and at least 600,000 square feet (56,000&nbsp;m2) of retail. These are the King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is the largest in the United States (leasable sq. feet of retail space), and the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was the first enclosed mall on the East Coast. Malls, office complexes, strip shopping plazas, expressways, and tract housing are common sights, and more and more continue to replace rolling countryside, farms, woods, and wetlands. However, due to strong opposition by residents and political officials, many acres of land have been preserved throughout the Delaware Valley. Older townships and large boroughs such as Cheltenham, Norristown, Jenkintown, Upper Darby and West Chester retain distinct community identities while engulfed in suburbia. The fastest-growing counties[when?] are Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, and Gloucester. Upper Darby, in Delaware County is the largest township in the United States.[citation needed] Sometimes Reading is included in the Delaware Valley Metro Area.[citation needed]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>The Delaware Valley has four distinct seasons with ample precipitation and is divided by the 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) January isotherm. Most of Philadelphia and the NJ portion, almost all of the DE and MD portions, part of Delaware County, and extreme southern portions of Bucks and Chester Counties have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and normally do vary widely within the Delaware Valley. The region has only two ski areas: Bear Creek Ski and Recreation Area in eastern Berks County and Spring Mountain in central Montgomery County.</p><p>Using the -3&nbsp;°C January isotherm as a boundary, all of the Delaware Valley is humid subtropical except for portions of Berks County and higher areas of northern Chester County. The warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) only exists in higher areas of Berks where all monthly temperatures average below 22&nbsp;°C.</p><h2>Colonial history[edit]</h2><p>See also: Thirteen Colonies</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The valley was the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape, who are recalled in place names throughout the region. The region became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland after the exploration of Delaware Bay in 1609. The Dutch called the Delaware River the Zuyd Rivier, or South River, and considered the lands along it banks and those of its bay to be the southern flank of its province of New Netherland. In 1638, it began to be settled by Swedes, Forest Finns, Dutch, and Walloons and became the colony of New Sweden, though this was not officially recognized by the Dutch Empire which re-asserted control in 1655. The area was taken by the English in 1664.[31] The name Delaware comes from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who had arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1610, just as original settlers were about to abandon it, and thus maintaining the English foothold on the North American continent.</p><h2>Transportation[edit]</h2><p>Many residents commute to jobs in Philadelphia, Camden, and Wilmington with the help of expressways and trains.

Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions and application[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Dymaxion_map_unfolded-no-ocean.png/220px-Dymaxion_map_unfolded-no-ocean.png" width="220" height="126"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A Dymaxion map shows land masses with minimal shape distortion.</p><p>By convention, continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.[2] Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion large leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is deemed the smallest continent.</p><p>Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]</p><h3>Extent[edit]</h3><p>The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as the Continent) is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.</p><p>From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]</p><p>From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Island_nations.svg/300px-Island_nations.svg.png" width="300" height="154"><br><p>Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.</p><p>As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]</p><h3>Separation[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Boundaries between the continents of Earth
See also: List of transcontinental countries</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as more or less discrete masses of land.[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.</p><p>North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.</p><p>The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]</p><p>If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.</p><p>When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia–New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.</p><h3>Number[edit]</h3><p> There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:</p><p>The term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.</p><h2>Highest and lowest points[edit]</h2><p>See also: Extremes on Earth, Extreme points of Earth, and Seven Summits</p><p>The following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.</p><p>† The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (-1,512 metres (-4,961&nbsp;ft)[27]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (-2,540 metres (-8,330&nbsp;ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some sources list the Kuma–Manych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc (elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe - the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.</p><h2>Other divisions[edit]</h2><h3>Supercontinents[edit]</h3><p>Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.</p><h3>Subcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[28] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[28]</p><p>In many of these cases, the subcontinents concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[29] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[30][31] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.</p><p>Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[32][33][34] or three (with Central America being the third).[35][36] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[28]</p><h3>Submerged continents[edit]</h3><p>Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.</p><h3>Microcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as the eighth continent from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[37]</p><h3>Botanical continents[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/WGSRPD_World.svg/300px-WGSRPD_World.svg.png" width="300" height="164"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>"Botanical continents" defined by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.</p><p>Continents may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine botanical continents. Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[38]</p><h2>History of continental configurations[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Geological history of the Earth</p><h2>History of the concept[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Strabo.jpg/187px-Strabo.jpg" width="187" height="226"><br><p>The Ancient Greek geographer Strabo holding a globe showing Europa and Asia</p><h3>Early concepts of the Old World continents[edit]</h3><p>The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[39] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[40] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and ...&nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...[39]</p><p>Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[41] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[42] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[43] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[44] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (Libya) and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[45] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.</p><p>Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them islands. Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents peninsulas. These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[46]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Medieval T and O map showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah—Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham).</p><p>Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away.[47]</p><h3>European arrival in the Americas[edit]</h3><p>Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.</p><p>In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[48] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (New World), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[49] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[50] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa,[51] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.</p><p>Within a few years the name New World began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[50]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg/375px-Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg" width="375" height="208"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia</p><p>In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named America after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[52] On the map, the word America was placed on part of South America.</p><h3>The word continent[edit]</h3><p>From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[53] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[54] The noun was used to mean a connected or continuous tract of land or mainland.[53] It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[53] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three parts of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[55]</p><p>While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa. In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new. And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.[56] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as parts of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png/250px-Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png" width="250" height="198"><br><p>Hollandia Nova, 1659 map prepared by Joan Blaeu based on voyages by Abel Tasman and Willem Jansz, this image shows a French edition of 1663</p><h3>Beyond four continents[edit]</h3><p>From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[57]</p><p>Europeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[57] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[58]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Antarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great Antarctic (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[59]</p><p>From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[60]</p><p>From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[60] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]</p><p>Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[61] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Continental crust and Plate tectonics</p><p>Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian shield, typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are high and dry; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[62]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg/350px-Plates_tect2_en.svg.png" width="350" height="239"><br><p>The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal rafts that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.</p><p>There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[63][64] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.</p><p>Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (continental rocks, plate boundaries) are used as appropriate.</p><p>The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.[65][66] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes;[4] its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.[1] The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>For much of European history, the north polar regions remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. Pytheas of Massilia recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called Eschate Thule, where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance on which one can neither walk nor sail. He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as growlers or bergy bits; his Thule was probably Norway, though the Faroe Islands or Shetland have also been suggested.[5]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg/220px-Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg" width="220" height="189"><br><p>Emanuel Bowen's 1780s map of the Arctic features a "Northern Ocean".</p><p>Early cartographers were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in Johannes Ruysch's map of 1507, or Gerardus Mercator's map of 1595) or water (as with Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the Northern Sea Route or the Northwest Passage, to Cathay (China) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as Johann Homann featured an extensive Oceanus Septentrionalis at the northern edge of their charts.</p><p>The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the Arctic Circle in this era added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not so clear.

Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority Matthew Fontaine Maury included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook The Physical Geography of the Sea (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who travelled closer and closer to the pole reported, the polar ice cap is quite thick, and persists year-round.</p><p>Fridtjof Nansen was the first to make a nautical crossing of the Arctic Ocean, in 1896.

The Russian continental shelf consists of three separate, smaller shelves, the Barents Shelf, Chukchi Sea Shelf and Siberian Shelf. Of these three, the Siberian Shelf is the largest such shelf in the world. The Siberian Shelf holds large oil and gas reserves, and the Chukchi shelf forms the border between Russian and the United States as stated in the USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement. The whole area is subject to international territorial claims.</p><h3>Underwater features[edit]</h3><p>An underwater ridge, the Lomonosov Ridge, divides the deep sea North Polar Basin into two oceanic basins: the Eurasian Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500&nbsp;m (13,100 and 14,800&nbsp;ft) deep, and the Amerasian Basin (sometimes called the North American, or Hyperborean Basin), which is about 4,000&nbsp;m (13,000&nbsp;ft) deep. The bathymetry of the ocean bottom is marked by fault block ridges, abyssal plains, ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038&nbsp;m (3,406&nbsp;ft).[13] The deepest point is Litke Deep in the Eurasian Basin, at 5,450&nbsp;m (17,880&nbsp;ft).</p><p>The two major basins are further subdivided by ridges into the Canada Basin (between Alaska/Canada and the Alpha Ridge), Makarov Basin (between the Alpha and Lomonosov Ridges), Amundsen Basin (between Lomonosov and Gakkel ridges), and Nansen Basin (between the Gakkel Ridge and the continental shelf that includes the Franz Josef Land).</p><h2>Oceanography[edit]</h2><h3>Water flow[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg/650px-BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg.png" width="650" height="200"><p>Distribution of the major water mass in the Arctic Ocean.

It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams (Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Mackenzie), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called halocline, in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Copepodkils.jpg/250px-Copepodkils.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>A Copepod</p><p>Because of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It is classified as a mediterranean sea, which as “a part of the world ocean which has only limited communication with the major ocean basins (these being the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans) and where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing”.[14] The Arctic Ocean has a total volume of 18.07×106 km3, equal to about 1.3% of the World Ocean. Mean surface circulation is predominately cyclonic on the Eurasian side and anticyclonic in the Canadian Basin.[15]</p><p>Water enters from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can be divided into three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around 900 metres (3,000 feet) depth.[14] It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow Bering Strait at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the Chukchi Sea.[16] During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4&nbsp;cm/s.[15] This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a halocline.[17]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png/220px-Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png" width="220" height="156"><br><p>The Kennedy Channel.</p><p>This water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.[14] Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the depth range of 150–900 metres (490–2,950 feet) is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the North Atlantic Current enters through the Fram Strait, cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the Arctic Basin counter-clockwise. This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.[16] It flows slowly, at about 0.02&nbsp;m/s.[14] Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&nbsp;°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density.[14] When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the Beaufort Gyre. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.[17]</p><p>The final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from 150–200 metres (490–660 feet). The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the Siberian Shelf.[14] As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3-0.6&nbsp;m/s.[14] Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.</p><p>Waters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard Island, which is about 2,700 metres (8,900 feet) deep and 350 kilometres (220 miles) wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.[16] The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the Coriolis force, which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the Norwegian Current on the eastern side.[14] Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the Hudson Strait (1-2 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.[16]</p><p>As noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses. With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.[15] During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the Icelandic Low, which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer. These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months. There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.[15]</p><h3>Sea ice[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg/300px-2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg" width="300" height="251"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Sea cover in the Arctic Ocean, showing the median, 2005 and 2007 coverage [18]


Main article: Arctic ice pack</p><p>Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the ice has been decreasing since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000&nbsp;km2 (6,023,200&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) at a rate of 3% per decade. The seasonal variations are about 7,000,000&nbsp;km2 (2,702,700&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) with the maximum in April and minimum in September. The sea ice is affected by wind and ocean currents, which can move and rotate very large areas of ice. Zones of compression also arise, where the ice piles up to form pack ice.[19][20][21]</p><p>Icebergs occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island, and icebergs are formed from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. These icebergs pose a hazard to ships, of which the Titanic is one of the most famous. Permafrost is found on most islands. The ocean is virtually icelocked from October to June, and the superstructure of ships are subject to icing from October to May.[11] Before the advent of modern icebreakers, ships sailing the Arctic Ocean risked being trapped or crushed by sea ice (although the Baychimo drifted through the Arctic Ocean untended for decades despite these hazards).</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>See also: Climate change in the Arctic</p><br><img alt="File:North Pole Sea Ice 1990-1999.ogv" style="width:210px;height:158px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv/210px--North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv.jpg"><p>Play media


Changes in ice between 1990–1999</p><p>Under the influence of the Quaternary glaciation, the Arctic Ocean is contained in a polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by the polar night, extreme cold, frequent low-level temperature inversions, and stable weather conditions.[22] Cyclones are only common on the Atlantic side.[23] Summers are characterized by continuous daylight (midnight sun), and temperatures can rise above the melting point (0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F). Cyclones are more frequent in summer and may bring rain or snow.[23] It is cloudy year-round, with mean cloud cover ranging from 60% in winter to over 80% in summer.[24]</p><p>The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Because the Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater, the temperature must reach -1.8&nbsp;°C (28.8&nbsp;°F) before freezing occurs.</p><p>The density of sea water, in contrast to fresh water, increases as it nears the freezing point and thus it tends to sink. It is generally necessary that the upper 100–150&nbsp;m (330–490&nbsp;ft) of ocean water cools to the freezing point for sea ice to form.[25] In the winter the relatively warm ocean water exerts a moderating influence, even when covered by ice. This is one reason why the Arctic does not experience the extreme temperatures seen on the Antarctic continent.</p><p>There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50&nbsp;cm (7.9 to 19.7&nbsp;in) over the frozen ocean.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20&nbsp;°C (50–68&nbsp;°F).[26] The surface waters of the northernmost[27] Arctic Ocean warmed, seasonally at least, enough to support tropical lifeforms[28] requiring surface temperatures of over 22&nbsp;°C (72&nbsp;°F).[29]</p><h2>Animal and plant life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg/220px-Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Three polar bears approach USS Honolulu near the North Pole.</p><p>Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem which is slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage.[11] Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean.</p><p>The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton.[30] Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[31] During summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to photosynthesize for long periods of time and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter when they struggle to get enough light to survive.[31]</p><h2>Natural resources[edit]</h2><p>See also: Natural resources of the Arctic, Territorial claims in the Arctic, and Marine mammal</p><p>Petroleum and natural gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, fish, seals and whales can all be found in abundance in the region.[11][21]</p><p>The political dead zone near the centre of the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark.[32] It is significant for the global energy market because it may hold 25% or more of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources.[33]</p><h2>Environmental concerns[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: Climate change in the Arctic, Ozone depletion, and Pollution in the Arctic Ocean</p><h3>Arctic ice melting[edit]</h3><p>The Arctic ice pack is thinning, and in many years there is also a seasonal hole in the ozone layer.[34] Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism.[21][35] Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free for the first time in human history within a few years or by 2040.[36][37] Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.[38]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.[35]</p><p>As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.[39]</p><h3>Clathrate breakdown[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Clathrate gun hypothesis</p><br><img alt="Extinction intensity.svg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Extinction_intensity.svg/320px-Extinction_intensity.svg.png" width="320" height="195" usemap="#ImageMap_1_838532597"><p>Marine extinction intensity during the Phanerozoic

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>This is a list of contiguous urban areas of the world ordered according to population as of 2014/2015. The figures here have been taken from Demographia's World Urban Areas study.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions and issues</h2><p>For more details on definitions, see World's largest cities.</p><p>Demographia defines an urban area (urbanized area agglomeration or urban centre) as a continuously built up land mass of urban development that is within a labor market (i.e. metropolitan area or metropolitan region), without regard for administrative boundaries (i.e. municipality, city or commune). Except in Australia, the authorities use a minimum urban density definition of 400 persons per square kilometer (or the nearly identical 1,000 per square mile in the United States). Demographia uses maps, satellite photographs to estimate continuous urbanization. Demographia also uses small area population data, where available, to match population estimates to urbanized land area. National census authority data are presented in Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Census of India urban agglomerations are not used in some cases because the geographical size of constituent units (municipalities) often includes large rural (non-urban) areas.</p><p>Sources for population estimates and land area definitions are coded by letter in the Table below, respectively.</p><p>A: National census authority data agglomeration data (land area or population).

W: Population estimate based upon the World Bank Urban Area 2015 estimate.</p><p>The projected year (2013) population estimate is further calculated from the base year population estimate using population growth rate based upon the United Nations population growth rate with some exceptions.</p><p>The estimates are quite different from the list of World's largest urban agglomerations produced by the United Nations that reports inconsistently on urban geographic, despite its reference to agglomerations. This is evident, for example, in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Seoul and Moscow, where the UN data are for political jurisdictions, rather than urban areas. In other cases, the UN data is for metropolitan area, which are larger than urban areas (such as in Brazil). Finally, the United Nations data is incomplete, excluding some significant urban areas (such as Essen–Düsseldorf in Germany).[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Urban areas are confined to a single nation, unless there is freedom of movement (including labor) between the adjacent nations. Currently, this condition is met only between some continental nations of the European Union and Switzerland (e.g. Lille–Kortrijk in both France and Belgium, Aachen–Vaals in both Germany and Netherlands, Saarbrücken–Forbach in both Germany and France, Geneva–Annemasse in both Switzerland and France, and Basel–Lörrach–Saint-Louis in Switzerland, Germany and France). Thus, Detroit–Windsor in both the United States and Canada, and San Diego–Tijuana in both the United States and Mexico are not treated as single urban areas. Moreover, Shenzhen–Hong Kong is treated as separate urban areas, principally because labor movement between the two is limited, with the former within China and the latter a special administrative region of China.[citation needed]</p><p>According to the report, there are 875 identified urban areas in the world with 500,000 or more population as of 2013.

For other such areas in the state, see New York State metropolitan areas.</p><p>The New York metropolitan area, also referred to as the Tri-State Area, includes the most populous city in the United States (New York City), Long Island, and the Mid- and Lower Hudson Valley in the state of New York; the five largest cities in New Jersey: Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth, and Edison, and their vicinities; six of the seven largest cities in Connecticut: Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk, and Danbury, and their vicinities; and five counties in northeastern Pennsylvania.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As per the 2015 United States Census Bureau estimates, the New York metropolitan area remains, by a significant margin, the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2&nbsp;million residents)[2] and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7&nbsp;million residents);[1] it is also one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world, and the single largest in North America.[3][4][5] The New York metropolitan area continues to be the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States,[6][7][8][9] with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The MSA covers 6,720&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi (17,405&nbsp;km2), while the CSA area is 13,318&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi (34,493&nbsp;km2), encompassing an ethnically and geographically diverse region. The New York metropolitan area's population is larger than that of the state of New York, and the metropolitan airspace accommodated over 130 million passengers in 2016.[10]</p><p>As a center of many industries, including finance, international trade, new and traditional media, real estate, education, fashion, entertainment, tourism, biotechnology, and manufacturing, the New York City metropolitan region is one of the most important economic regions in the world; in 2015, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.60&nbsp;trillion,[11] while in 2015, the CSA[12] had a GMP of over US$1.83&nbsp;trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only nine nations and seven nations, respectively.[13] In 2012, the New York metropolitan area was also home to seven of the 25 wealthiest counties in the United States by median household income, according to the American Community Survey.[14] According to Forbes, in 2014, the New York City metropolitan area was home to eight of the top ten ZIP codes in the United States by median housing price, with six in Manhattan alone.[15] The New York metropolitan region's higher education network comprises hundreds of colleges and universities, including Columbia University, Princeton University, and Yale University which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.[16][17]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions[edit]</h2><h3>Metropolitan Statistical Area[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/New_York_City%2C_Southern_RI_and_CT%2C_illuminated_at_night.jpg/250px-New_York_City%2C_Southern_RI_and_CT%2C_illuminated_at_night.jpg" width="250" height="167"><br><p>Satellite imagery showing the New York metropolitan area at night</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Palisades_cliff.jpg/220px-Palisades_cliff.jpg" width="220" height="294"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Part of the Palisades Interstate Park, the cliffs of the New Jersey Palisades of Bergen County overlook the Hudson River as well as The Bronx and Upper Manhattan in New York City.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/LI_region_DEM-2.jpg/220px-LI_region_DEM-2.jpg" width="220" height="105"><br><p>Enveloped by the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound, New York City and Long Island alone are home to approximately 11 million residents conjointly.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Bear_Mtn_Bridge.jpg/220px-Bear_Mtn_Bridge.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>The Bear Mountain Bridge connecting Westchester and Rockland Counties, New York across the Hudson River as seen from Bear Mountain.</p><p>The U.S. Office of Management and Budget utilizes two definitions of the area: the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

The New York City television designated market area (DMA) includes Pike County, Pennsylvania,[19] which is also included in the CSA.</p><p>In addition to the New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA Metropolitan Statistical Area, the following core-based statistical areas are also included in the New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area:</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/High_Point_Monument_and_Lake_Marcia_framed.jpg/220px-High_Point_Monument_and_Lake_Marcia_framed.jpg" width="220" height="287"><br><p>High Point Monument as seen from Lake Marcia at High Point, Sussex County, the highest elevation in New Jersey at 1803 feet above sea level.[20]</p><p>The area is frequently divided into the following subregions:[21][22]</p><p>All eight subregions are often further divided. For instance, Long Island can be divided into its South and North Shores (usually when speaking about Nassau County and western Suffolk County) and the East End. The Hudson Valley and Connecticut are sometimes grouped together and referred to as the Northern Suburbs, largely because of the shared usage of the Metro-North Railroad system.[23]</p><h3>Subregions[edit]</h3><p>New York City[edit]
Main article: New York City</p><p>The geographical, cultural, and economic center of the metropolitan area is New York City, which consists of five boroughs, each of which is also a county of New York State.[24] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[25] With a Census-estimated population of 8,550,405 in 2015 (8,491,079 in 2014[26][27]), distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790&nbsp;km2),[28] New York is the most densely populated major city in the United States.[29] A global power city,[30] New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace[31][32] defining the term New York minute.[33] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[34] New York is an important center for international diplomacy[35] and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital[36][37] of the world.[38][39][40][41][42]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Long Island[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Pineapple_-_Garden_City_NY.jpg/220px-Pineapple_-_Garden_City_NY.jpg" width="220" height="236"><br><p>The Village of Garden City in Nassau County, Long Island's Town of Hempstead, which with over 770,000 people is the New York metropolitan area's most populous individual municipality outside New York City.[43]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/WesthamptonInnerWaterway.jpg/220px-WesthamptonInnerWaterway.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Westhampton, Suffolk County, New York, on the East End of Long Island.


Main article: Long Island</p><p>Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region wholly within both the U.S. state of New York and the New York City metropolitan area. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, most people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term Long Island (or The Island) exclusively to refer to the Nassau-Suffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character.[44] North of the island is Long Island Sound, across which are the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p><p>With a Census-estimated population of 7,838,722 in 2015, constituting nearly 40% of New York State's population,[45][46][47][48][49] The majority of New York City residents, 58% as of 2015, now live on Long Island, namely the estimated the 4,896,398 residents living in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.[50] Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 17th-most populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaido). Its population density is 5,571 inhabitants per square mile (2,151/km2). If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first in population density. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[51][52] The Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, with an estimated population of 770,367 in 2016, is the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside of New York City.[43]</p><p>Long Island is the most populated island in the United States and the 17th most populous island in the world. Known especially for recreation, boating and miles of public beaches, including numerous town, county and state parks and Fire Island National Seashore. Along the north shore, the Gold Coast of Long Island is an upscale section of Nassau and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th century, of which only a few remain preserved as historic sites. The East End of Long Island (known as the Twin Forks because of its physical shape) boasts open spaces for farmland and wineries. The South Fork, in particular, comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as The Hamptons and has an international reputation as a playground for the rich and famous, with some of the wealthiest communities in the United States. In 2015, according to Business Insider, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S. by real estate-listings site Property Shark, with a median home sale price of $5,125,000.[53] During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside in mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying the beaches, gardens, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Long Island is served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway being major east-west routes across significant portions of the island. Passenger rail access is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Long Island Rail Road, one of the largest commuter railroads in the United States. Air travel needs are served by several airports. Within Queens, the island is home to John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, two of the three major airline hubs serving the New York City area (with Newark Liberty International Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey). Islip MacArthur Airport (serving commercial airlines) and Farmingdale/Republic Airport (private and commuter flights) are both located in Suffolk County.</p><p>Northern New Jersey[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bigfalls14w_info.jpg/220px-Bigfalls14w_info.jpg" width="220" height="137"><br><p>The Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson, Passaic County, New Jersey, dedicated as a National Historical Park in November 2011, incorporates one of the largest waterfalls in the eastern United States.[54]

Lower Hudson Valley[edit]
Main article: Hudson Valley</p><p>Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, and quaint small towns and villages, the Lower Hudson Valley is centered around the Hudson River north of New York City and lies within New York State. Its two most populous counties, Westchester and Rockland, are located on the eastern and western sides of the river, respectively, connected by the heavily trafficked Tappan Zee Bridge (a major commuter route from Rockland County towards New York City) as well as the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region's rail commuters. Southern Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains. Although many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence and expense (some examples: Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Katonah, and Briarcliff Manor), the Lower Hudson Valley as a whole is one of the fastest-growing areas in the metropolitan area because of high housing costs in New York City and the inner suburbs.</p><p>Historically, the valley was home to many factories, including paper mills, but a significant number have closed. After years of lingering pollution, cleanup efforts to improve the Hudson River water quality are currently planned and will be supervised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[56]</p><p>Western Connecticut[edit]</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/MohawkMountain.jpg/220px-MohawkMountain.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area in Cornwall, Litchfield County, Connecticut, in the Berkshire Mountains.

Geographically, the areas are flat along the coast with low hills eventually giving way to larger hills such as The Berkshires further inland, to the Massachusetts border. Most of the largest cities in the state are located within New Haven County (home to Yale University) and Fairfield County.</p><p>Monroe and Pike Counties, Pennsylvania[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Dingmansfalls.jpg/220px-Dingmansfalls.jpg" width="220" height="291"><br><p>Dingmans Falls in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Pike County, northeastern Pennsylvania.

Main article: Pike County, Pennsylvania</p><p>Pike County is located in northeastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 57,369.[57] Its county seat is Milford.[58] Part of the Pocono Mountains region lies within Pike County, which has ranked among the fastest-growing counties of Pennsylvania.[59]</p><p>Monroe County was added to the CMSA in March 2013, as was the Lehigh Valley. Monroe's county seat is Stroudsburg, and its largest borough is East Stroudsburg. Monroe and Pike are the fastest-growing counties in Pennsylvania and are home to many residents who commute to jobs in Northern New Jersey and New York City. They are located largely in the Pocono Mountains and have multiple state parks as well as most of the Pennsylvania portion of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Efforts continue to resume passenger rail service on the Lackawanna Cutoff route between Scranton and Northern New Jersey via Monroe County.</p><p>Lehigh Valley[edit]
Main articles: Carbon County, Pennsylvania; Lehigh County, Pennsylvania; Northampton County, Pennsylvania; and Warren County, New Jersey</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA (better known as the Lehigh Valley) consists of Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton counties. It constitutes the third-largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania, and Allentown is the state's third-largest city. The region is important for east-west transportation between New York City, northern and central New Jersey, the Harrisburg metropolitan area, and points west, both by rail and Interstate 78. It is also critical for north-south road traffic via Interstate 476 and the Route 33 Expressway. The Lehigh Valley is in the process of major urban economic redevelopment, including development of the logistics industry as well as the Two Rivers Landing in downtown Easton, the Steel Stacks/Sands complex on the south side of Bethlehem, and a multi-purpose arena (which hosted its first event on September 12, 2014) in downtown Allentown. In 2010 the population was 712,481 for the PA portion and 821,173 in the MSA as a whole. While a large portion of Carbon County is in the Pocono Mountains, it is also in the Lehigh River valley and the employment interchange is mainly with Lehigh and Northampton Counties.</p><h3>Urban areas of the region[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg/220px-StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Downtown Stamford in Fairfield County, Connecticut.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/NewHavenCT_Green.jpg/220px-NewHavenCT_Green.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>The New Haven Green Historic District in Connecticut was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1970.[60]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fullnycskyline.jpg/1600px-Fullnycskyline.jpg" width="1600" height="238"><p>Skyline of New York City and Jersey City from Newark, New Jersey, seen prior to completion of One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>From the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the Age of Discovery, and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the Great Divergence, a term coined by Samuel Huntington[58] the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.</p><h3>Modern era[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg/170px-Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg" width="170" height="206"><br><p>The United States Constitution</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg/170px-Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg" width="170" height="135"><br><p>La Liberté guidant le Peuple by French painter Eugène Delacroix</p><p>Coming into the modern era, the historical understanding of the East-West contrast—as the opposition of Christendom to its geographical neighbors—began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The Age of Discovery faded into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the Catholic Church; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism.</p><p>Philosophers of the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Voltaire (1694–1778), David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.[59] influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as enlightened absolutism. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by Voltaire spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the scientific revolution, spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of modern science, during which developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.[60][61][62][63][64][65] While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution, and its completion is attributed to the grand synthesis of Newton's 1687 Principia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools.[66] These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.[67]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/220px-Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>A Watt steam engine. The steam engine, made of iron and fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world.[68]</p><p>The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[69][70][71] The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[72][73][74][75] GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,[76] while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.[77] Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants[78] and fire.</p><p>The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories.[79][80][81]</p><h2>Arts and humanities[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg/220px-Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg" width="220" height="243"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry showing William the Conqueror (centre), his half-brothers Robert, Count of Mortain (right) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux in the Duchy of Normandy (left).

While dance, music, visual art, story-telling, and architecture are human universals, they are expressed in the West in certain characteristic ways.</p><p>In Western dance, music, plays and other arts, the performers are only very infrequently masked. There are essentially no taboos against depicting a god, or other religious figures, in a representational fashion.</p><h3>Music[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg/180px-Beethoven.jpg" width="180" height="216"><br><p>Ludwig van Beethoven composed many Masses and religious works, including his Ninth Symphony Ode to Joy.</p><p>In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,[82] and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.[83]</p><p>The symphony, concerto, sonata, opera, and oratorio have their origins in Italy. Many important musical instruments used by cultures all over the world were also developed in the West; among them are the violin, piano, pipe organ, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, accordion, and the theremin. The solo piano, symphony orchestra, and the string quartet are also important performing musical forms.</p><p>Many forms of popular music have been derived from African-Americans, and their innovations of jazz and blues serve as the basis from which much of modern popular music derives. Folklore and music during 19th and 20th centuries, initially by themselves, but later played and further developed together with White and Black Americans, British people, and Westerners in general. These include jazz, blues and rock music (that in a wider sense include the rock and roll and heavy metal genres), rhythm and blues, funk, hip hop, techno as well as the ska and reggae genres from Jamaica. Several other related or derived styles were developed and introduced by Western pop culture such as pop and dance music.</p><h3>Painting and photography[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Attributed_to_Jan_van_Eyck%2C_Netherlandish_%28active_Bruges%29%2C_c._1395_-_1441_-_Saint_Francis_of_Assisi_Receiving_the_Stigmata_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Attributed_to_Jan_van_Eyck%2C_Netherlandish_%28active_Bruges%29%2C_c._1395_-_1441_-_Saint_Francis_of_Assisi_Receiving_the_Stigmata_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="189"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata, attributed to Jan van Eyck, from 1430 until 1432</p><p>Jan van Eyck, among other renaissance painters, made great advances in oil painting, and perspective drawings and paintings had their earliest practitioners in Florence.[84] In art, the Celtic knot is a very distinctive Western repeated motif.

It is widely considered the preeminent work in Italian literature,[86] and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.[87] The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. In this scene, Charon comes to ferry souls across the river Acheron to the Christian Hell. Engraving by Gustave Doré</p><p>While epic literary works in verse such as the Mahabharata and Homer's Iliad are ancient and occurred worldwide, the prose novel as a distinct form of storytelling, with developed, consistent human characters and, typically, some connected overall plot (although both of these characteristics have sometimes been modified and played with in later times), was popularized by the West[88] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the Hellenistic world and in Heian Japan. Both Petronius' Satyricon (c. 60 CE) and the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.</p><p>Tragedy, from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical opera.</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg/260px-Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg" width="260" height="260"><br><p>Rayonnant rose window in Notre Dame de Paris.

The scientific method as a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses was almost entirely fashioned by the Italian Galileo Galilei.[90][91]</p><p>The Western World has been the leading force in the technological and scientific disciplines: whether measured in people or events, 97 percent of accomplishment in the scientific inventories occurred in Europe and North America. The Dictionary of Scientific Biography (DoSB) sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies, concluded that Eighty-one percent of the most significant scientists and mathematicians come from Europe compared to 76 percent in the Human Accomplishment set, numbers that rise to 94 and 91 percent respectively when the United States and Canada are included.[92] The United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy alone account for 72 percent of all the significant scientific figures in science from 1400 to 1950. Add in Russia and the Netherlands, and 80 percent of all significant figures are accounted for.[93]</p><p>By the will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel the Nobel Prize were established in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[94] The percentage of ethnically European noble prize winners during the first and second halves of the 20th century were respectively 98 and 94 percent.[95] A study by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) - Japan's equivalent of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) concluded that 54% of the world's most important inventions were British. Of the rest, 25% were American and 5% Japanese.[96]</p><p>It was the West that first developed steam power and adapted its use into factories, and for the generation of electric power.[97][98] The electrical motor, dynamo, transformer, and electric light, and indeed most of the familiar electrical appliances, were inventions of the West.[99][100][101][102] The Otto and the Diesel internal combustion engines are products whose genesis and early development were in the West.[103][104] Nuclear power stations are derived from the first atomic pile constructed in Chicago in 1942.[105]</p><p>Communication devices and systems including the telegraph, the telephone, radio, television, communications and navigation satellites, mobile phone, and the Internet were all invented by Westerners.[106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] The pencil, ballpoint pen, Cathode ray tube, liquid-crystal display, light-emitting diode, camera, photocopier, laser printer, ink jet printer, plasma display screen and world wide web were also invented in the West.[114][115][116][117][118][119]</p><p>Ubiquitous materials including concrete, aluminium, clear glass, synthetic rubber, synthetic diamond and the plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene were invented in the West. Iron and steel ships, bridges and skyscrapers first appeared in the West. Nitrogen fixation and petrochemicals were invented by Westerners. Most of the elements, were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary atomic theories to explain them.[citation needed]</p><p>The transistor, integrated circuit, memory chip, and computer were all first seen in the West. The ship's chronometer, the screw propeller, the locomotive, bicycle, automobile, and airplane were all invented in the West. Eyeglasses, the telescope, the microscope and electron microscope, all the varieties of chromatography, protein and DNA sequencing, computerised tomography, Nuclear magnetic resonance, x-rays, and light, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories.[citation needed]</p><p>In medicine, the pure antibiotics were created in the West. The method of preventing Rh disease, the treatment of diabetes, and the germ theory of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of smallpox, was led by a Westerner, Donald Henderson. Radiography, Computed tomography, Positron emission tomography and Medical ultrasonography are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of clinical chemistry including the methods of spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay were first devised by Westerners. So were the stethoscope, electrocardiograph, and the endoscope. Vitamins, hormonal contraception, hormones, insulin, Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, along with a host of other medically proven drugs were first utilized to treat disease in the West. The double-blind study and evidence-based medicine are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In mathematics, calculus, statistics, logic, vectors, tensors and complex analysis, group theory and topology were developed by Westerners.[120][121][122][123][124][125][126] In biology, evolution, chromosomes, DNA, genetics and the methods of molecular biology are creatures of the West. In physics, the science of mechanics and quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics were all developed by Westerners. The discoveries and inventions by Westerners in electromagnetism include Coulomb's law (1785), the first battery (1800), the unity of electricity and magnetism (1820), Biot–Savart law (1820), Ohm's Law (1827), and the Maxwell's equations (1871). The atom, nucleus, electron, neutron and proton were all unveiled by Westerners.[citation needed]</p><p>In business, economics, and finance, double entry bookkeeping, credit card, and the charge card were all first used in the West.[127][128]</p><p>Westerners are also known for their explorations of the globe and outer space. The first expedition to circumnavigate the Earth (1522) was by Westerners, as well as the first journey to the South Pole (1911), and the first moon landing (1969).[129][130] The landing of robots on Mars (2004 and 2012) and on an asteroid (2001), the Voyager 2 explorations of the outer planets (Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989), Voyager 1's passage into interstellar space (2013), and New Horizons' flyby of Pluto (2015) were significant recent Western achievements.[131][132][133][134][135]</p><h2>Media[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Western media</p><p>The Western media refers to the news media of the Western world. The roots of the Western media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when printing presses began to operate throughout Western Europe. The emergence of news media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press, from which the publishing press derives its name.[136]</p><p>In the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of Latin in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the discoveries arising from trade and travel, navigation to the new world, science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in Western Europe.[137]</p><p>After the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the U.S. launching Telstar in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in America in 1975.[138]</p><p>Beginning in the 1990s, the Internet has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages (magazines, CDs, television and radio slots), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items (articles, audio and video files).[139]</p><h2>Religion[edit]</h2><p>The native religions of Europe were polytheistic but not homogenous—however they were similar insofar as they were predominantly Indo-European in origin. Roman religion was similar to but not the same as Hellenic religion—likewise the same for indigenous Germanic polytheism, Celtic polytheism and Slavic polytheism. Western culture, for at least the last 1000 years, has been considered nearly synonymous with Christian culture.[140] Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards.</p><p>Western culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians. The notion of Europe and the Western World has been intimately connected with the concept of Christianity and Christendom many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.[17]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As in other areas, Judaism is found in the Western world. Minority groups, and Jews in particular, often had to contend with discrimination and persecution. This could include being subjected to violence and/or destruction of property (this may be referred to as a pogrom) as well as being expelled or banned from various polities, hoping to find havens in other places.[141]</p><p>Religion has waned considerably in Europe, where many are today irreligious, agnostic or atheist and they make up about 18% of the European population.[142] In terms of irreligion, over half of the populations of the Czech Republic (79% of the population was agnostic, atheist or irreligious), the United Kingdom (~25%),[143] Germany (25–33%),[144] France (30–35%)[145][146][147] and the Netherlands (39–44%) are agnostic, atheist, or otherwise non-religious.</p><p>However, per another survey by Pew Research Center from 2011, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world where 70–84% are Christians,[148] According to this survey, 76% of Europeans described themselves as Christians,[148][149][150] and about 86% of the Americas population identified themselves as Christians,[151] (90% in Latin America and 77% in North America).[152] And 73% in Oceania are self-identify as Christian, and 76% in South Africa is Christian.[148]</p><p>According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population.[153] Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU population, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%.[154] Non believer/Agnostic account 16%,[153] Atheist account's 7%,[153] and Muslim 2%.[153]</p><p>Throughout the Western world there are increasing numbers of people who seek to revive the indigenous religions of their European ancestors, such groups include Germanic, Roman, Hellenic, Celtic and Slavic, polytheistic reconstructionist movements, likewise, Wicca, new age spirituality and other neo-pagan belief systems enjoy notable minority support in Western nations.</p><h2>Sport[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Bull-leaping.jpg/220px-Bull-leaping.jpg" width="220" height="119"><br><p>The Bull-Leaping Fresco from the Great Palace at Knossos, Crete.

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at Athens in 1896.</p><p>The Romans built immense structures such as the Colisseum in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for blood sports, such as the infamous Gladiatorial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of Classical Antiquity—such as Greco-Roman wrestling, discus and javelin. The sport of bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice and is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its Central and South American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.</p><p>Jousting and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the Middle Ages, and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of the popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. The Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence—these include Ping Pong, modern tennis, Association Football, Netball and Rugby.</p><p>Football (also known as soccer) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the world game. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the Rugby World Cup has been shared among the Western nations of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.</p><p>Australian Rules Football, an Australian variation of football with similarities to Gaelic football and rugby evolved in the British colony of Victoria in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of baseball to America during the colonial period. The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Many games known as football were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, the Father of American Football. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. From these American origins, basketball has become one of the great international participation sports.</p><p>Professionalism in sport in the West became prevalent during the 20th Century, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet—all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.</p><h2>Themes and traditions[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg/220px-Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg" width="220" height="279"><br><p>A Madonna and Child painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas.</p><p>Western culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:[citation needed]</p><h3>Notes[edit]</h3><h3> [edit]</h3><br><img alt="Page semi-protected" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png" width="20" height="20"><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Africa</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square&nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4% of its total land area.[2] With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population.[1] The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.[3]</p><p>Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[4][5] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[6] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.[7] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.[8]</p><p>Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonised almost all of Africa. Africa also varies greatly with regard to environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. However, most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations have attempted to cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg/170px-Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg" width="170" height="228"><br><p>Statue representing Africa at Palazzo Ferreria, in Valletta, Malta</p><p>Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[9][10] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician ?afar 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis[11] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) cave, in reference to cave dwellers.[12] The same word[12] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[13]</p><p>Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[14] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, located in modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.</p><p>According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while Asia was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.</p><p>Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name Africa:</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Africa

Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0&nbsp;million years BP,[20] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4&nbsp;million years BP)[21] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9&nbsp;million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[2]</p><p>After the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[22][23][24] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[25][26] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[27] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[28]</p><p>Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[29]</p><p>The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[30] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[31] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[32] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.</p><p>The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[33] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.</p><p>Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[34] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[34]</p><p>By the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,[35] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[34]</p><h3>Early civilizations</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Ancient African history</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg/220px-Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt, date from around 1400 BC.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Bantu_expansion.png/170px-Bantu_expansion.png" width="170" height="180"><br><p>The origins and spread of the Bantu languages c. 1000 BC to c. 500 AD</p><p>At about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.[36] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[37][38] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[39]</p><p>An independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[40][41][42]</p><p>European exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans.[citation needed] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[43]</p><p>Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[44]</p><p>Christianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[45] by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[46]</p><p>In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Ninth to eighteenth centuries</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg/170px-Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg" width="170" height="234"><br><p>African horseman of Baguirmi in full padded armour suit</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG/170px-Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG" width="170" height="232"><br><p>The intricate 9th-century bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu, in Nigeria displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.[48]</p><p>Pre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[49] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa; the large Sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Akan; Edo, Yoruba, and Igbo people in West Africa; and the Swahili coastal trading towns of Southeast Africa.</p><p>By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.</p><p>In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri. The Nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of Igbo-Ukwu.

Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture. The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.</p><p>The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[51] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[52] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[53]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg/220px-Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg" width="220" height="132"><br><p>Ruins of Great Zimbabwe (eleventh to fifteenth centuries)</p><p>Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[54] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods.

Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.[57][58][59] More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[60]</p><p>In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[61]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg/220px-The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg" width="220" height="166"><br><p>Slave being inspected, from Captain Canot; or, Twenty Years of an African Slaver</p><p>Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against the usurping King of Lagos, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[62] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[63]</p><h3>Colonialism and the Scramble for Africa</h3><p>Main article: Colonization of Africa

Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.</p><h3>Berlin Conference</h3><p>The Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.</p><h3>Independence struggles</h3><p>Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[64] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[65] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.</p><p>Portugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.</p><h3>Post-colonial Africa</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Mobutu_Sese_Seko_1973.jpg" width="140" height="186"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5 billion from his country.</p><p>Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.</p><p>Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/SADF-Operations_4.jpg/220px-SADF-Operations_4.jpg" width="220" height="177"><br><p>South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the South African Border War</p><p>Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund,[citation needed] also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.[66][67][68] The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[69] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.</p><p>In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[70] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[71]</p><h2>Geography</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Geography of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/187_1003703_africa_dxm.png/220px-187_1003703_africa_dxm.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Satellite photo of Africa.

Main article: African Union</p><p>The African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[84] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.</p><p>The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.</p><p>Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg/450px-Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg.png" width="450" height="405" usemap="#ImageMap_1_1093313515"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="The image above contains clickable links" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Interactive_icon.svg/18px-Interactive_icon.svg.png" title="The image above contains clickable links" width="18" height="27"><p>Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational African entities v • d • e</p><h2>Economy</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/RECs_of_the_AEC.svg/220px-RECs_of_the_AEC.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Map of the African Economic Community.

Main article: Economy of Africa
See also: Economy of the African Union and Water in Africa</p><p>Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[85] According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[86]</p><p>Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[87] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.[88]</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[89] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[90][91][92]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[93] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[94] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[95] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[96] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.[97]</p><p>In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[70]</p><p>A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.[98]</p><p>During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.[99]</p><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Main article: Demographics of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Kobli1.jpg/220px-Kobli1.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Woman from Benin</p><p>Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young.

The Bantu-speaking peoples from The Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[104] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (San or Bushmen) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also San, closely related to, but distinct from Hottentots) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[105]</p><p>The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.</p><p>The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[106] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[citation needed]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bedscha.jpg/220px-Bedscha.jpg" width="220" height="196"><br><p>Beja bedouins from Northeast Africa</p><p>In the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.</p><p>Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[107] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[108] Kenya, Congo,[109] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[110] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[111] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa.[112] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[113] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[114]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[70] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[115]</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Main article: Languages of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg/170px-Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg" width="170" height="196"><br><p>Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa:

Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:</p><p>Following the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.</p><h2>Culture</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg/220px-Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The rock-hewn Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Main article: Culture of Africa</p><p>Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[118] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to civilize Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[118]</p><p>Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[119] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art. [120] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[120] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art. [121] In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.[122] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe. [123] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies. [124]</p><p>There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.</p><h3>Visual art and architecture</h3><p>African art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.[125] The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg/170px-Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg" width="170" height="340"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A musician from South Africa</p><h3>Music and dance</h3><p>Main article: Music of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg/170px-Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg" width="170" height="227"><br><p>The Namibia rugby team</p><p>Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.</p><h3>Sports</h3><p>Fifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups.

South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup.

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions.

For the body of water surrounding them, see Caribbean Sea. For other uses, see Caribbean (disambiguation).</p><p>The Caribbean (/?kær?'bi??n/ or /k?'r?bi?n/) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea[3] and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean[4]) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.</p><p>Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the region comprises more than 700 islands, islets, reefs and cays. (See the list.) These islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea.[5] The Caribbean islands, consisting of the Greater Antilles on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east (including the Leeward Antilles), are part of the somewhat larger West Indies grouping, which also includes the Lucayan Archipelago (comprising the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands) north of the Greater Antilles and Caribbean Sea. In a wider sense, the mainland countries of Belize, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana are often included due to their political and cultural ties with the region.[6]</p><p>Geopolitically, the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of North America[7][8][9][10][11] and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies. From December 15, 1954, to October 10, 2010, there was a country known as the Netherlands Antilles composed of five states, all of which were Dutch dependencies.[12] From January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was also a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then British dependencies. The West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology and pronunciation[edit]</h2><p>The region takes its name from that of the Caribs, an ethnic group present in the Lesser Antilles and parts of adjacent South America at the time of the Spanish conquest of America.[13]</p><p>The two most prevalent pronunciations of Caribbean are KARR-?-BEE-?n, with the primary accent on the third syllable, and k?-RIB-ee-?n, with the accent on the second. The former pronunciation is the older of the two, although the stressed-second-syllable variant has been established for over 75 years.[14] It has been suggested that speakers of British English prefer KARR-?-BEE-?n while North American speakers more typically use k?-RIB-ee-?n,[15] although not all sources agree.[16] Usage is split within Caribbean English itself.[17]</p><h2>Definition[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png/300px-CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png" width="300" height="207"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Map of the Caribbean</p><p>The word Caribbean has multiple uses.

<div class="content"><p> Further information: Evolution of microeconomics</p><p>Microeconomics (from Greek prefix mikro- meaning small) is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms.[1][2][3]</p><p>One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results.</p><p>Microeconomics stands in contrast to macroeconomics, which involves the sum total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment and with national policies relating to these issues.[2] Microeconomics also deals with the effects of economic policies (such as changing taxation levels) on the aforementioned aspects of the economy.[4] Particularly in the wake of the Lucas critique, much of modern macroeconomic theory has been built upon 'microfoundations'—i.e. based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Assumptions and definitions</h2><p>Microeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual. To economists, rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive. The technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function. Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable.</p><p>Microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set. It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no guarantee that a rational individual would maximize utility. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory. The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences. The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices but why individuals make choices as well.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is a constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. That is, since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed, a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence.</p><p>The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as the primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as the primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as Revealed preference theory.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg/220px-Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability at each price (supply) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand). The graph depicts a right-shift in demand from D1 to D2 along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new market-clearing equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).


		</p><p>
			The theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive. This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions.</p><p>Mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss. A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good. In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating missing markets to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed.</p><p>This is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory. Optimal welfare usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor–Hicks method. This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory.</p><p>The demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set.</p><p>
		Microeconomic theories are involved with the choices that households and firms make. Some of these microeconomic concepts include elasticity of demand and supply, market structures and utility. Microeconomic looks into the way individuals and businesses behave in coming up with decisions to do with the distribution of rare resources and collaborations between these individuals and the firm. A production possibility frontier illustrates the maximum probable output combinations of two services or goods an economy may realise while all other resources are efficiently and wholly engaged. A production possibility frontier is used to explain the models of opportunity cost, illustrate the effects of economic development and demonstrate the theory of trade-offs.</p><p>Supply and demand is possibly amongst the most crucial conceptions of economics and it is the pillar of the economy of a market. Demand can be explained as the extent to which a service or a good is desired by users. The amount demanded is the sum of a commodity individuals are ready to purchase at a certain given price. Supply on the other hand refers to how much of a product a market can provide. The supplied quantity is the volume of a particular commodity manufacturers are willing to supply at a certain price. The relationship between demand and supply trigger the forces as a result of the sharing of resources. The law of demand states that when all other influences stay constant the higher the price of a good, the lesser the demand of the given produce. In other word the greater the price the lower the amount needed. The amount of a good bought by customers at a greater price is lower as the price rises the opportunity cost of buying a commodity. People will therefore naturally evade buying a commodity that will need them to sacrifice the use of something else that is more significant to them. Similar to the law of demand, the law of supply reveals the amounts that will be traded at a certain given price. Contrasting the law of demand, the supply relationship gives a rising slope. This means that the bigger the price the greater the quantity in supply. Manufacturers supply more at a high price because selling a quantity at a higher price rises income. Where demand and supply are the same, the economy is held to be at equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium the distribution of goods is at its most effectual because the amount of goods at supply is precisely the same as the volume of goods in demand. Therefore every individual is contented with prevailing state of the economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Elasticity is defined as the degree of receptiveness in demand and supply in relation to fluctuations in price. If a curve is more elastic then lesser alterations in price will result to a higher change in quantity used up. If a curve is less elastic it will then cause higher deviations in price to affect a change in amount consumed. Price elasticity of demand is the extent of responsiveness in quantity demanded in relation to price. Utility on the other hand is the amount of contentment resulting from the consumption of a commodity or services at a particular period. Utility is a psychological satisfaction not inherent. It is dependent on the persons own subjective approximate of satisfaction to be acquired from the consumption of a commodity. Utility is further divided into marginal utility, total utility and maximizing utility. Marginal utility refers to the extra utility resulting from the consumption of one extra unit of a commodity, the consumption of the rest of the goods remaining unaffected. Total utility is refers to as the number of units of utility that a consumer gains from consuming a given quantity of a good, service, or activity during a particular time period. The greater a consumers total utility, the larger the customer’s level of consumption. The cost to any firm of producing any output evidently depends upon the physical amounts of real resources. For instance material, labour and machine hours used in production. As the larger output needs a larger amount of resources, the total cost for larger output becomes high. Whereas the smaller output requires the smaller resources. The total cost for smaller output becomes smaller. A company can produce at lower cost when it produces better new techniques to products. Production with traditional and old method implicates high cost. The maximisation of returns includes the use of a definite technique to produce that can facilitate the optimal combination of factors. Production cost is defined as the expenditures by a business in producing a commodity. There are several kinds of cost concepts, these are marginal cost, total cost and average cost. Total is the cost of producing a certain output of the product in question. Total cost can be classified into variable cost and fixed cost. Fixed costs is also known as overhead cost. These are costs which do not differ with output. The costs will be the same whether the output is ten or twenty or a thousand of a product. Fixed costs entails interest on bank loans, depreciation of machinery, insurance charges and rent of factory. Variable costs are also called prime cost. Variable costs differ with alterations in output. The greater the output, the bigger the variable costs. Average cost is the cost of each unit of output and is achieved by dividing the total cost by the level of output. It is further divided into two parts, average fixed cost and average variable cost. Marginal cost is defined as the extra cost incurred by increasing output by one unit. It is the added cost of producing an additional unit of output. Perfect competition is a market structure in which the following characteristics are met. All businesses trade the same commodity, all firms will have a comparatively small market share, all firms are price takers meaning they cannot control the market price of their goods, the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit, and buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm. Perfect competition is a hypothetical market structure. Under perfect competition there are numerous buyers and sellers and prices reveal supply and demand. Customers will have several substitutes when the commodity they wish to buy quality begins to reduce or if it becomes more expensive. News firms can as well simply enter the market, leading to an extra competition. Monopoly on the other hand is where there is only one supplier in the market. For the reasons of regulation, monopoly power occurs where a single business owns 25% or more of a particular market. Monopolies can form for a number of reasons. For example, government can grant a business monopoly powers, if a firm has exclusive ownership of a limited resource, producers may have patents over designs for instance, giving them rights to trade a good or a service and a merger of two or more firms would create a monopoly. Monopolies have basic characteristics such as, they can maintain super normal returns in the long run, a monopolist with no substitute would be able to develop the greatest monopoly power and with no close substitutes, the monopolist can therefore derive supernormal profits.</p><p>In conclusion, microeconomics tries in any way not to explain what ought to happen in a market. Instead it will explains what to anticipate if some conditions are altered. For instance if producers increase the price of a commodity, customers will opt to purchase fewer of a product than before.</p><h2>Topics</h2><p>The study of microeconomics involves several key areas:</p><h3>Demand, supply, and equilibrium</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Main article: Supply and demand</p><p>Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market. It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.</p><h3>Measurement of elasticities</h3><p> Main article: Elasticity (economics)</p><p>Elasticity is the measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another variable. Elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable, when the later variable has a causal influence on the former. It is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable, or of the function that determines it, to changes in causative variables in unitless ways. Frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.</p><h3>Consumer demand theory</h3><p> Main article: Consumer choice</p><p>Consumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves. The link between personal preferences, consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics. It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints.</p><h3>Theory of production</h3><p> Main article: Production theory</p><p>Production theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs. Production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use, gift-giving in a gift economy, or exchange in a market economy. This can include manufacturing, storing, shipping, and packaging. Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption. They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production.</p><h3>Costs of production</h3><p> Main article: Cost-of-production theory of value</p><p>The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production: labour, capital, land. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (ex:plant) or circulating capital (ex:intermediate goods).</p><h3>Perfect competition</h3><p> Main article: Perfect competition</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Perfect competition describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as eBay, on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers.</p><p>Benefits of Perfect Competition- All the knowledge such as price and information pertaining goods is equally dispersed among all buyers and sellers. As there are no barriers to enter into the market, monopoly does not usually occur. As all goods and products are same, advertisement is not required and it helps save the advertisement cost.in perfect competition products are identical</p><h3>Monopoly</h3><p> Main article: monopoly</p><p>A monopoly (from Greek monos µ???? (alone or single) + polein p??e?? (to sell)) exists when a single company is the only supplier of a particular commodity.</p><p>Benefits of Monopoly Market- Prices in monopoly market are stable as there is only one firm and so there is no competition. Due to the absence of competition there are high profits and leads to high number of sales monopoly firms tend to receive super profits from their operations.</p><h3>Oligopoly</h3><p> Main article: Oligopoly</p><p>An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output.[5]</p><p>Benefits of oligopoly market-As there is less competition in the firm, it tends to have massive profit.It is also able to easily compare prices forces these companies to keep their prices in competition with the other companies involved in the market.Each company scrambles to come out with latest and greatest thing in order to sway consumers to go with their company over a different one.</p><h3>Market structure</h3><p>The market structure can have several types of interacting market systems. Different forms of markets are a feature of capitalism and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system.</p><p>Examples of markets include but are not limited to: commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, stock markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market.</p><h3>Game theory</h3><p> Main article: Game theory</p><p>Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. The term game here implies the study of any strategic interaction between people. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers &amp; acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design,and voting systems, and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Labour economics</h3><p> Main article: Labour economics</p><p>Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers), the demands of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, labour is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.</p><h3>Welfare economics</h3><p> Main article: Welfare economics</p><p>Welfare economics is a branch of economics that uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well-being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium.[7] It analyzes social welfare, however measured, in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no social welfare apart from the welfare associated with its individual units.</p><h3>Economics of information</h3><p> Main article: Information economics</p><p>Information economics or the economics of information is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions. Information has special characteristics. It is easy to create but hard to trust. It is easy to spread but hard to control. It influences many decisions. These special characteristics (as compared with other types of goods) complicate many standard economic theories.[8]</p><h2>Opportunity cost</h2><p> Main article: Opportunity cost</p><p>Opportunity cost of an activity (or goods) is equal to the best next alternative uses/forgone. Although opportunity cost can be hard to quantify, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real on the individual level. In fact, this principle applies to all decisions, not just economic ones.</p><p>Opportunity cost is one way to measure the cost of something. Rather than merely identifying and adding the costs of a project, one may also identify the next best alternative way to spend the same amount of money. The forgone profit of this next best alternative is the opportunity cost of the original choice. A common example is a farmer that chooses to farm their land rather than rent it to neighbors, wherein the opportunity cost is the forgone profit from renting. In this case, the farmer may expect to generate more profit alone. This kind of reasoning is a very important part of the calculation of discount rates in discounted cash flow investment valuation methodologies. Similarly, the opportunity cost of attending university is the lost wages a student could have earned in the workforce, rather than the cost of tuition, books, and other requisite items (whose sum makes up the total cost of attendance).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives, but rather the benefit of the single, best alternative. Possible opportunity costs of a city's decision to build a hospital on its vacant land are the loss of the land for a sporting center, or the inability to use the land for a parking lot, or the money that could have been made from selling the land, or the loss of any of the various other possible uses — but not all of these in aggregate. The true opportunity cost would be the forgone profit of the most lucrative of those listed.</p><p>One question that arises here is how to determine a money value for each alternative to facilitate comparison and assess opportunity cost, which may be more or less difficult depending on the things we are trying to compare. For example, many decisions involve environmental impacts whose monetary value is difficult to assess because of scientific uncertainty. Valuing a human life or the economic impact of an Arctic oil spill involves making subjective choices with ethical implications.</p><p>It is imperative to understand that no decision on allocating time is free. No matter what one chooses to do, they are always giving something up in return. An example of opportunity cost is deciding between going to a concert and doing homework. If one decides to go the concert, then they are giving up valuable time to study, but if they choose to do homework then the cost is giving up the concert. Any decision in allocating capital is likewise: there is an opportunity cost of capital, or a hurdle rate, defined as the expected rate one could get by investing in similar projects on the open market. Opportunity cost is vital in understanding microeconomics and decisions that are made.</p><h2>Applied</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg/220px-United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg" width="220" height="146"><p>

			Applied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study, many of which draw on methods from other fields. Industrial organization examines topics such as the entry and exit of firms, innovation, and the role of trademarks. Labor economics examines wages, employment, and labor market dynamics. Financial economics examines topics such as the structure of optimal portfolios, the rate of return to capital, econometric analysis of security returns, and corporate financial behavior. Public economics examines the design of government tax and expenditure policies and economic effects of these policies (e.g., social insurance programs). Political economy examines the role of political institutions in determining policy outcomes. Health economics examines the organization of health care systems, including the role of the health care workforce and health insurance programs. Education economics examines the organization of education provision and its implication for efficiency and equity, including the effects of education on productivity. Urban economics, which examines the challenges faced by cities, such as sprawl, air and water pollution, traffic congestion, and poverty, draws on the fields of urban geography and sociology. Law and economics applies microeconomic principles to the selection and enforcement of competing legal regimes and their relative efficiencies. Economic history examines the evolution of the economy and economic institutions, using methods and techniques from the fields of economics, history, geography, sociology, psychology, and political science.</p><p>&lt;ref&gt;==References==</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microeconomics&amp;oldid=783350389"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><h1 lang="en">Rational choice theory</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p> This article is about a theory of economics. For rational choice theory as applied to criminology, see Rational choice theory (criminology).</p><p>Rational choice theory, also known as choice theory or rational action theory, is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behavior.[1] The basic premise of rational choice theory is that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions. The theory also focuses on the determinants of the individual choices (methodological individualism).</p><p>Rational choice theory then assumes that an individual has preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.</p><p>Rationality is widely used as an assumption of the behavior of individuals in microeconomic models and analyses and appears in almost all economics textbook treatments of human decision-making. It is also used in political science,[2] sociology,[3] and philosophy. A particular version of rationality is instrumental rationality, which involves seeking the most cost-effective means to achieve a specific goal without reflecting on the worthiness of that goal. Gary Becker was an early proponent of applying rational actor models more widely.[4] Becker won the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his studies of discrimination, crime, and human capital.[5]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definition and scope</h2><p>The concept of rationality used in rational choice theory is different from the colloquial and most philosophical use of the word. Colloquially, rational behaviour typically means sensible, predictable, or in a thoughtful, clear-headed manner. Rational choice theory uses a narrower definition of rationality. At its most basic level, behavior is rational if it is goal-oriented, reflective (evaluative), and consistent (across time and different choice situations). This contrasts with behavior that is random, impulsive, conditioned, or adopted by (unevaluative) imitation.[citation needed]</p><p>Early neoclassical economists writing about rational choice, including William Stanley Jevons, assumed that agents make consumption choices so as to maximize their happiness, or utility. Contemporary theory bases rational choice on a set of choice axioms that need to be satisfied, and typically does not specify where the goal (preferences, desires) comes from. It mandates just a consistent ranking of the alternatives.[6]:501 Individuals choose the best action according to their personal preferences and the constraints facing them. E.g., there is nothing irrational in preferring fish to meat the first time, but there is something irrational in preferring fish to meat in one instant and preferring meat to fish in another, without anything else having changed.</p><p>Rational choice theorists do not claim that the theory describes the choice process, but rather that it predicts the outcome and pattern of choices. An assumption often added to the rational choice paradigm is that individual preferences are self-interested, in which case the individual can be referred to as a homo economicus. Such an individual acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage.[7] Proponents of such models, particularly those associated with the Chicago school of economics, do not claim that a model's assumptions are an accurate description of reality, only that they help formulate clear and falsifiable hypotheses.[citation needed] In this view, the only way to judge the success of a hypothesis is empirical tests.[7] To use an example from Milton Friedman, if a theory that says that the behavior of the leaves of a tree is explained by their rationality passes the empirical test, it is seen as successful.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg" width="150" height="179"><p>Without specifying the individual's goal or preferences it may not be possible to empirically test, or falsify, the rationality assumption. However, the predictions made by a specific version of the theory are testable. In recent years, the most prevalent version of rational choice theory, expected utility theory, has been challenged by the experimental results of behavioral economics. Economists are learning from other fields, such as psychology, and are enriching their theories of choice in order to get a more accurate view of human decision-making. For example, the behavioral economist and experimental psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for his work in this field.</p><p>Rational choice theory has become increasingly employed in social sciences other than economics, such as sociology, evolutionary theory and political science in recent decades.[8][9] It has had far-reaching impacts on the study of political science, especially in fields like the study of interest groups, elections, behaviour in legislatures, coalitions, and bureaucracy.[10] In these fields, the use of the rational choice paradigm to explain broad social phenomena is the subject of active controversy.[11][12]</p><h2>Actions, assumptions, and individual preferences</h2><p>The premise of rational choice theory as a social science methodology is that the aggregate behavior in society reflects the sum of the choices made by individuals. Each individual, in turn, makes their choice based on their own preferences and the constraints (or choice set) they face.</p><p>At the individual level, rational choice theory stipulates that the agent chooses the action (or outcome) they most prefer. In the case where actions (or outcomes) can be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, a rational individual chooses the action (or outcome) that provides the maximum net benefit, i.e., the maximum benefit minus cost.</p><p>The theory applies to more general settings than those identified by costs and benefit. In general, rational decision making entails choosing among all available alternatives the alternative that the individual most prefers. The alternatives can be a set of actions (what to do?) or a set of objects (what to choose/buy). In the case of actions, what the individual really cares about are the outcomes that results from each possible action. Actions, in this case, are only an instrument for obtaining a particular outcome.</p><h3>Formal statement</h3><p>The available alternatives are often expressed as a set of objects, for example a set of j exhaustive and exclusive actions:</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rational_choice_theory&amp;oldid=770556981"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Normative economics</h1><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Normative economics (as opposed to positive economics) is a part of economics that expresses value or normative judgments about economic fairness or what the outcome of the economy or goals of public policy ought to be.[1]</p><p>Economists commonly prefer to distinguish normative economics (what ought to be in economic matters) from positive economics (what is). Many normative (value) judgments, however, are held conditionally, to be given up if facts or knowledge of facts changes, so that a change of values may be purely scientific.[2] On the other hand, welfare economist Amartya Sen distinguishes basic (normative) judgments, which do not depend on such knowledge, from nonbasic judgments, which do. He finds it interesting to note that no judgments are demonstrably basic while some value judgments may be shown to be nonbasic. This leaves open the possibility of fruitful scientific discussion of value judgments.[3]</p><p>Positive and normative economics are often synthesized in the style of practical idealism. In this discipline, sometimes called the art of economics, positive economics is utilized as a practical tool for achieving normative objectives.</p><p>An example of a normative economic statement is as follows:</p><p>This is a normative statement, because it reflects value judgments. This specific statement makes the judgment that farmers need a higher living standard and that family farms need to be saved.[1]</p><p>Subfields of normative economics include social choice theory, cooperative game theory, and mechanism design.</p><p>Some earlier technical problems posed in welfare economics and the theory of justice have been sufficiently addressed as to leave room for consideration of proposals in applied fields such as resource allocation, public policy, social indicators, and inequality and poverty measurement.[4]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Normative_economics&amp;oldid=782036831"

					</p><br><h1 lang="en">Business economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Business economics is a field in applied economics which uses economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze business enterprises and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, capital and product markets.[1] A professional focus of the journal Business Economics has been expressed as providing practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Subject matter</h2><p>Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why corporate firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.[1]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Ambiguity in the use of term</h2><p>The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/industrial organisation, managerial economics, and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly. One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with industry but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.[3] Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.[4]</p><h2>Interpretations from various universities</h2><p>Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.[5] The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at University of Delhi is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.[6]</p><p>The program at Harvard University uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including business administration, management, and related fields of business economics.[7]</p><p>The University of Miami defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.[8]</p><p>Courses at the University of Manchester interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural theory of the firm; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the structure, conduct and performance of business at the industry level.[9]</p><p>Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of Gino Zappa, for example a standard course[10] at the Politecnico di Milano involves studying corporate governance, accounting, investment analysis, budgeting and business strategy.</p><p>La Trobe University of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.</p><h2>Notes</h2><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_economics&amp;oldid=771210217"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Mainstream economics</h1><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Mainstream economics is the body of knowledge, theories, and models of economics, as taught across prominent universities, that are widely accepted by scholars in the field. It can be contrasted to heterodox economics, which are various schools or approaches that are only accepted by their expositors, with little influence on the majority of academic economists. Mainstream economics has been associated with neoclassical economics[1] and with the neoclassical synthesis, which combines neoclassical methods and a Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>United States</h2><p>In the United States, mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary economic schools of thought have been the saltwater and freshwater schools. In the early 1970s, so-called fresh-water economists challenged the prevailing consensus in macroeconomics research. Key elements of their approach were that macroeconomics had to be dynamic, quantitative, and based on how individuals and institutions make decisions under uncertainty. Many of the proponents of this radically new approach to macroeconomics were associated with Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester and the University of Minnesota. They were referred to as the freshwater school since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester, and Minneapolis are located nearer to the Great Lakes. The established consensus was primarily defended by economists at the universities and other institutions located near the east and west coast of the United States, such as Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, and Yale. They were therefore often referred to as the saltwater schools. Today, mainstream economists do not, in general, identify themselves as members of a particular school.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Economics has always featured multiple schools of economic thought, with different schools having different prominence across countries and over time. The current use of the term mainstream economics is specific to the post–World War II era, particularly in the English-speaking world, and to a lesser extent globally.</p><p>Prior to the development of modern academic economics, the dominant school in Europe was mercantilism, which was rather a loose set of related ideas than an institutionalized school. With the development of modern economics, conventionally given as the late 18th-century The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, British economics developed and became dominated by what is now called the classical school. From The Wealth of Nations until the Great Depression, the dominant school within the English-speaking world was classical economics, and its successor, neoclassical economics.[3] In continental Europe, the earlier work of the physiocrats in France formed a distinct tradition, as did the later work of the historical school of economics in Germany, and throughout the 19th century there were debates in British economics, notably the opposition underconsumptionist school.</p><p>During the Great Depression and the following Second World War, the school of Keynesian economics gained prominence, which built on the work of the underconsumptionist school, and present-day mainstream economics stems from the neoclassical synthesis, which was the post–World War II merger of Keynesian macroeconomics and neoclassical microeconomics.</p><p>In continental Europe, by contrast, Keynesian economics was rejected, with German thought dominated by the Freiburg school, whose political philosophy of ordoliberalism formed the intellectual basis of Germany's post-war social market economy. Within developing economies, which formed the majority of the world's population, various schools of development economics have been influential.</p><p>Since 2007, the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the ensuing global economic crisis has publicly exposed divisions within mainstream economics and significantly intensified controversy about its status, with some arguing for radical overhaul or rejection of mainstream economics, others arguing for evolutionary change, and others still arguing that mainstream economics explains the crisis.[4]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Term</h3><p>The term mainstream economics came into common use in the late 20th century. It appears in 2001 edition of the seminal textbook Economics by Samuelson and Nordhaus[5] on the inside back cover in the Family Tree of Economics, which depicts arrows into Modern Mainstream Economics from J.M. Keynes (1936) and neoclassical economics (1860–1910). The term neoclassical synthesis itself also first appears in the 1955 edition of Samuelson's textbook.[6]</p><h2>Scope</h2><p>Mainstream economics can be defined, as distinct from other schools of economics, by various criteria, notably by its assumptions, its methods, and its topics.</p><h3>Assumptions</h3><p>A number of assumptions may underpin many mainstream economic models, while being rejected by some heterodox schools. These include the neoclassical assumptions of rational choice theory, a representative agent, and, often, rational expectations. Much of modern economic modelling consists of exploring the effects that complicating factors have on models, such as imperfect and asymmetric information, incomplete markets, imperfect competition and transaction costs.</p><p>The starting point of orthodox economic analysis is the individual. People are generally defined as units with a common goal: maximisation through rational behaviour. The only differences consist of:</p><p>From this theoretical framework, orthodox economists derive that political action should not be used to solve the problems of the economic system. Instead, the solution ought to derive from an intervention on the above-mentioned maximisation objectives and constraints. It is in this context that economic capitalism finds its justification. Capitalism and its arguments seem logical because orthodox economics theories think of the aggregate economy as the sum of the agents trying to maximise their utility or profit through exchange.[7]</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Mainstream economics has also been defined methodologically as work which mainstream economists are willing to engage, which requires conforming to the mainstream language of mathematical models,[8] featuring calculus, optimization, and comparative statics. Under this definition, areas of thought which are typically thought of as heterodox because they do not work under the typical neoclassical assumptions, such as econophysics, behavioral economics, and evolutionary economics, can be considered mainstream when they are engaged in the mainstream, using mainstream methods.[8] Geoffrey Hodgson has considered the possibility that evolutionary economics and institutional economics may eventually become a new mainstream.[9]</p><p>Additionally, some economic fields include elements of both mainstream economics and heterodox economics: for example, the Austrian economics[how?],[10] institutional economics, neuroeconomics and non-linear complexity theory.[11] They may use neoclassical economics as a point of departure. At least one institutionalist has argued that neoclassical economics no longer dominates a mainstream economics.[12]</p><p>A countervailing trend is the expansion of mainstream methods to such seemingly distant fields as crime, the family, law, politics, and religion. The latter phenomenon is sometimes referred to as economic imperialism.[13]</p><h3>Topics</h3><p>Mainstream economics includes theories of market and government failure and private and public goods. These developments suggest a range of views on the desirability or otherwise of government intervention.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>Since the financial crisis of 2007–2010, considerable conflict has arisen, among both economic theorists and a wider cross-section of the public, regarding the status and future of mainstream economics.[4][14] Some critics have argued that potentially promising approaches have been excluded in major mainstream publications by a focus on problems amenable to formal modeling.[15][16]</p><p>Chartalists, who are generally considered part of the Post-Keynesian school of thought, criticise mainstream theory as failing to describe the actual mechanics of modern fiat monetary economies. Chartalism focuses on a detailed understanding of the way money actually flows through the different sectors of an economy. Specifically, Chartalism focuses on the interaction between central banks, treasury and the private banking system. Chartalism rejects critical mainstream theories such as the loanable funds market, the money multiplier, and the utility of fiscal austerity.</p><p>Some economists, in the vein of ecological economics, believe that the neoclassical holy trinity of rationality, greed, and equilibrium, is being replaced by the holy trinity of purposeful behavior, enlightened self-interest, and sustainability, considerably broadening the scope of what is mainstream.[8] Ecological economics addresses sustainability issues, such as public goods, natural capital and negative externalities (such as pollution).[17]</p><p>Energy related theories of economic concepts also exist within energy economics relating to thermodynamic concepts of economic thinking, such as energy accounting.[18] Biophysical economics relates to this area.[19]</p><h3>Survey articles</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mainstream_economics&amp;oldid=783714535"

It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus.[1][2] The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive. [3]</p><p>A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital) and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.[4]</p><p>Green Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Green economists and economics</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the ecology movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to some equally ill-defined mainstream economics.[citation needed]</p><p>The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capital-G Green term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of 'green economists' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson's presentation of these.)[citation needed]</p><p>Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as canals). Or, it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.[citation needed]</p><p>An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of green economics. As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank[5] and International Monetary Fund (via its Green Fund initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance.[citation needed] Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives.[citation needed] The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that [b]ased on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation. [3]</p><h2>Definition</h2><p>Karl Burkart defines a green economy as based on six main sectors:[6]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/300px-Sustainable_development.svg.png" width="300" height="191" usemap="#ImageMap_1_1484116788"><p>The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) representing global business defines green economy as “an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development”.[7][8]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 2012, the ICC published the Green Economy Roadmap, containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two-year consultation process. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of “green economy”. It highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges. It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:</p><h2>Ecological measurements</h2><p>Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of economic index indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact, efficiency sectors like transport, energy, buildings and tourism, as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation.</p><li>2010 - 2016 Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI),[9] published by consultancy Dual Citizen LLC is in its 5th edition.

The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives.[citation needed] However, other experts[13] argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years.[14] Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, Towards a Green Economy,[15] while well-intentioned ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.[16] Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and green growth in particular, based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change and may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions.[17] Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,[18] and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis.[19] He has also criticised the UN's project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB),[20] and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Notes and references</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_economy&amp;oldid=781971723"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><p>Michael Grossman's 1972 model of health production[8] has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable. Grossman's model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health. Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of investments in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of capital. The model acknowledges that health is both a consumption good that yields direct satisfaction and utility, and an investment good, which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman's 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.</p><p>In Grossman's model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the marginal cost of health capital is equal to the marginal benefit. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate d. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: 
		  
			
			  
				M
				
				  C
				  
					H
					K
				  
				
				=
				r
				+
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle MC_{HK}=r+\delta \,}
		  
		. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, 
		  
			
			  
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle \delta \,}
		  
		 increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock. The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.</p><p>Beyond issues of the fundamental, real demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the marginal benefit of medical care (which is always associated with this real demand curve based on derived demand), and a separate effective demand curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices. Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price. The consumer sets MB=MC out of pocket, and so the effective demand will have a separate relationship between price and quantity than will the marginal benefit curve or real demand relationship. This distinction is often described under the rubric of ex-post moral hazard (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).</p><h2>Health technology assessment</h2><p>Economic evaluation, and in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen – IQWiG) in Germany and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.</p><p>Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of cost–utility analysis (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the Quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</p><h2>Healthcare markets</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The five health markets typically analyzed are:</p><p>Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created risk pools in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with adverse selection which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection (cherry-picking), and preexisting condition exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.</p><p>Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting moral hazard drives up costs, as shown by the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.</p><p>Consumers in healthcare markets often suffer from a lack of adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with supplier induced demand, whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial practice variations, whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.</p><p>Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.[9]</p><h2>Other issues</h2><h3>Medical economics</h3><p>Often used synonymously with health economics, medical economics, according to Culyer,[10] is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses mathematical models to synthesise data from biostatistics and epidemiology for support of medical decision-making, both for individuals and for wider health policy.</p><h3>Behavioral economics</h3><p>Peter Orszag has suggested that behavioral economics is an important factor for improving the healthcare system, but that relatively little progress has been made when compared to retirement policy.[11]</p><h3>Mental health economics</h3><p>Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from pharmacoeconomics to labor economics and welfare economics. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children.[12] Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home.[13] In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.[14]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual's potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture presenteeism, when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.[13]</p><p>Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral.[15] Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of knowledge brokers.[13]</p><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;oldid=783361465"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Public choice</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Public choice or public choice theory refers to the use of economic tools to deal with traditional problems of political science.[1] Its content includes the study of political behavior. In political science, it is the subset of positive political theory that studies self-interested agents (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained utility maximization, game theory, or decision theory.[1] Public-choice analysis has roots in positive analysis (what is) but is often used for normative purposes (what ought to be) in order to identify a problem or to suggest improvements to constitutional rules (i.e., constitutional economics).[1][2][3]</p><p>The Journal of Economic Literature's classification code regards public choice as a subarea of microeconomics, under JEL: D7: Analysis of Collective Decision-Making (specifically, JEL: D72: Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).[4] Public choice theory is also closely related to social-choice theory, a mathematical approach to aggregation of individual interests, welfares, or votes.[5] Much early work had aspects of both, and both fields use the tools of economics and game theory. Since voter behavior influences the behavior of public officials, public-choice theory often uses results from social-choice theory. General treatments of public choice may also be classified under public economics.[6]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background and development</h2><p>A precursor of modern public choice theory was the work of Knut Wicksell (1896),[7] which treated government as political exchange, a quid pro quo, in formulating a benefit principle linking taxes and expenditures.[8]</p><p>Some subsequent economic analysis has been described as treating government as though it attempted to maximize some kind sort of welfare function for society and as distinct from characterizations of economic agents, such as those in business.[1] In contrast, public choice theory modeled government as made up of officials who, besides pursuing the public interest, might act to benefit themselves, for example in the budget-maximizing model of bureaucracy, possibly at the cost of efficiency.[1][9]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Modern public-choice theory has been dated from the work of Duncan Black, sometimes called the founding father of public choice.[10] In a series of papers from 1948, which culminated in The Theory of Committees and Elections (1958),[11] and later, Black outlined a program of unification toward a more general Theory of Economic and Political Choices based on common formal methods,[12] developed underlying concepts of what would become median voter theory, and rediscovered earlier works on voting theory.[13][1][14]</p><p>Kenneth J. Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values (1951) influenced formulation of the theory. Among other important works are Anthony Downs (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy and Mancur Olson (1965) The Logic of Collective Action.[15]</p><p>James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock coauthored The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy (1962), considered one of the landmarks in public choice. In particular, the preface describes the book as about the political organization of a free society. But its methodology, conceptual apparatus, and analytics are derived, essentially, from the discipline that has as its subject the economic organization of such a society (1962, p. v). The book focuses on positive-economic analysis as to the development of constitutional democracy but in an ethical context of consent. The consent takes the form of a compensation principle like Pareto efficiency for making a policy change and unanimity or at least no opposition as a point of departure for social choice.</p><p>Somewhat later, the probabilistic voting theory started to displace the median voter theory in showing how to find Nash equilibria in multidimensional space. The theory was later formalized further by Peter Coughlin.[16]</p><h2>Decision-making processes and the state</h2><p>One way to organize the subject matter studied by public choice theorists is to begin with the foundations of the state itself. According to this procedure, the most fundamental subject is the origin of government. Although some work has been done on anarchy, autocracy, revolution, and even war, the bulk of the study in this area has concerned the fundamental problem of collectively choosing constitutional rules. This work assumes a group of individuals who aim to form a government, then it focuses on the problem of hiring the agents required to carry out government functions agreed upon by the members.[citation needed]</p><h2>Expressive interests and democratic irrationality</h2><p>Geoffrey Brennan and Loren Lomasky claim that democratic policy is biased to favor expressive interests and neglect practical and utilitarian considerations. Brennan and Lomasky differentiate between instrumental interests (any kind of practical benefit, both monetary and non-monetary) and expressive interests (forms of expression like applause). According to Brennan and Lomasky, the voting paradox can be resolved by differentiating between expressive and instrumental interests.</p><p>This argument has led some public choice scholars to claim that politics is plagued by irrationality. In articles published in the Econ Journal Watch, economist Bryan Caplan contended that voter choices and government economic decisions are inherently irrational.[17][18] Caplan's ideas are more fully developed in his book The Myth of the Rational Voter (Princeton University Press 2007). Countering Donald Wittman's arguments in The Myth of Democratic Failure, Caplan claims that politics is biased in favor of irrational beliefs.</p><p>According to Caplan, democracy effectively subsidizes irrational beliefs. Anyone who derives utility from potentially irrational policies like protectionism can receive private benefits while imposing the costs of such beliefs on the general public. Were people to bear the full costs of their irrational beliefs, they would lobby for them optimally, taking into account both their instrumental consequences and their expressive appeal. Instead, democracy oversupplies policies based on irrational beliefs. Caplan defines rationality mainly in terms of mainstream price theory, pointing out that mainstream economists tend to oppose protectionism and government regulation more than the general population, and that more educated people are closer to economists on this score, even after controlling for confounding factors such as income, wealth or political affiliation. One criticism is that many economists do not share Caplan's views on the nature of public choice. However, Caplan does have data to support his position. Economists have, in fact, often been frustrated by public opposition to economic reasoning. As Sam Peltzman puts it:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Economists know what steps would improve the efficiency of HSE [health, safety, and environmental] regulation, and they have not been bashful advocates of them. These steps include substituting markets in property rights, such as emission rights, for command and control...The real problem lies deeper than any lack of reform proposals or failure to press them. It is our inability to understand their lack of political appeal.[19]</p><p>Public choice's application to government regulation was developed by George Stigler (1971) and Sam Peltzman (1976).</p><h2>Special interests</h2><p>Public choice theory is often used to explain how political decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many advocacy group and pork barrel projects are not the desire of the overall democracy. However, it makes sense for politicians to support these projects. It may make them feel powerful and important. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as lobbyists. The project may be of interest to the politician's local constituency, increasing district votes or campaign contributions. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally. They can gain government favors worth millions or billions for relatively small investments. They face a risk of losing out to their competitors if they don't seek these favors. The taxpayer is also behaving rationally. The cost of defeating any one government give-away is very high, while the benefits to the individual taxpayer are very small. Each citizen pays only a few pennies or a few dollars for any given government favor, while the costs of ending that favor would be many times higher. Everyone involved has rational incentives to do exactly what they are doing, even though the desire of the general constituency is opposite. Costs are diffused, while benefits are concentrated. The voices of vocal minorities with much to gain are heard over those of indifferent majorities with little to individually lose.[20][21] However the notion that groups with concentrated interests will dominate politics is incomplete because it is only one half of political equilibrium. Something must incite those preyed upon to resist even the best organized concentrated interests. In his article on interest groups Gary Becker identified this countervailing force as being the deadweight loss from predation. His views capped what has come to be known as the Chicago school of political economy and it has come in sharp conflict with the so-called Virginia faction of public choice due to its assertion that politics will tend towards efficiency due to nonlinear deadweight losses and due to its claim that political efficiency renders policy advice irrelevant.[22]</p><p>While good government tends to be a pure public good for the mass of voters, there may be many advocacy groups that have strong incentives for lobbying the government to implement specific policies that would benefit them, potentially at the expense of the general public. For example, lobbying by the sugar manufacturers might result in an inefficient subsidy for the production of sugar, either direct or by protectionist measures. The costs of such inefficient policies are dispersed over all citizens, and therefore unnoticeable to each individual. On the other hand, the benefits are shared by a small special-interest group with a strong incentive to perpetuate the policy by further lobbying. Due to rational ignorance, the vast majority of voters will be unaware of the effort; in fact, although voters may be aware of special-interest lobbying efforts, this may merely select for policies which are even harder to evaluate by the general public, rather than improving their overall efficiency. Even if the public were able to evaluate policy proposals effectively, they would find it infeasible to engage in collective action in order to defend their diffuse interest. Therefore, theorists expect that numerous special interests will be able to successfully lobby for various inefficient policies. In public choice theory, such scenarios of inefficient government policies are referred to as government failure – a term akin to market failure from earlier theoretical welfare economics.[20]</p><h2>Rent-seeking</h2><p>A field that is closely related to public choice is rent-seeking. This field combines the study of a market economy with that of government. Thus, one might regard it as a new political economy. Its basic thesis is that when both a market economy and government are present, government agents provide numerous special market privileges. Both the government agents and self-interested market participants seek these privileges in order to partake in the resulting monopoly rent. Rentiers gain benefits above what the market would have offered, but in the process allocate resources in sub-optimal fashion from a societal point of view.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Rent-seeking is broader than public choice in that it applies to autocracies as well as democracies and, therefore, is not directly concerned with collective decision making. However, the obvious pressures it exerts on legislators, executives, bureaucrats, and even judges are factors that public choice theory must account for in its analysis of collective decision-making rules and institutions. Moreover, the members of a collective who are planning a government would be wise to take prospective rent-seeking into account.[21]</p><p>Another major claim is that much of political activity is a form of rent-seeking which wastes resources. Gordon Tullock, Jagdish Bhagwati, and Anne Osborn Krueger have argued that rent-seeking has caused considerable waste.[21] In a parallel line of research Fred McChesney claims that rent extraction causes considerable waste, especially in the developing world. As the term implies, rent extraction happens when officials use threats to extort payments from private parties.</p><h2>Bureaucracy</h2><p>Another major sub-field is the study of bureaucracy. The usual model depicts the top bureaucrats as being chosen by the chief executive and legislature, depending on whether the democratic system is presidential or parliamentary. The typical image of a bureau chief is a person on a fixed salary who is concerned with pleasing those who appointed him. The latter have the power to hire and fire him more or less at will. The bulk of the bureaucrats, however, are civil servants whose jobs and pay are protected by a civil service system against major changes by their appointed bureau chiefs. This image is often compared with that of a business owner whose profit varies with the success of production and sales, who aims to maximize profit, and who can in an ideal system hire and fire employees at will.[9] William Niskanen is generally considered the founder of public choice literature on the bureaucracy.[9]</p><h2>Political stance</h2><p>From such results it is sometimes asserted that public choice theory has an anti-state tilt. But there is ideological diversity among public choice theorists. Mancur Olson for example was an advocate of a strong state and instead opposed political interest group lobbying.[15] More generally, James Buchanan has suggested that public choice theory be interpreted as politics without romance, a critical approach to a pervasive earlier notion of idealized politics set against market failure.[23]</p><p>The British journalist, Alistair Cooke, commenting on the Nobel Prize awarded to James M. Buchanan in 1986, reportedly summarized the public choice view of politicians by saying, Public choice embodies the homely but important truth that politicians are, after all, no less selfish than the rest of us.[24]</p><h2>Recognition</h2><p>Several notable public choice scholars have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, including James M. Buchanan (1986), George Stigler (1982), Gary Becker (1992), Vernon Smith (2002) and Elinor Ostrom (2009). In addition, Vernon Smith and Elinor Ostrom were former presidents of the Public Choice Society.[25]</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>In their 1994 book Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory, political scientists Donald P. Green and Ian Shapiro argue that rational choice theory (of which public choice theory is a branch) has contributed less to the field than its popularity suggests.[26] They write:</p><p>Linda McQuaig writes in All You Can Eat:[citation needed]</p><p>Amartya Sen has acknowledged the contribution of Buchanan and Tullock's analysis of unanimity as a criterion for collective choice,[28] but argued for the logical inconsistency of the Pareto-principle version of unanimity with even minimal liberty in a social-choice framework.[29] More broadly he qualified its use when other information besides personal utility is given a weight in public judgments.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Buchanan and Tullock themselves outline methodological qualifications of the approach developed in their work The Calculus of Consent (1962), p. 30:</p><p>The reach of public choice theory might be even wider than Buchanan and Tullock indicate. Some theory shows that relaxing the assumption of self-interest leaves many public choice problems in place (although sometimes in altered from). As long as political actors are rational maximizers who disagree about the objectives government should pursue, public choice problems persist even if the disagreement stems from adherence to competing ethical principles rather than from competing self-interested wants.[31]</p><h3>New Ideas and Policy Innovation rather than Self Interest</h3><p>Another criticism suggests that some of the great developments in politics and policy have not been a product of individual actor's vested self interests, but rather because of new ideas. New ideas, by virtue of being innovative, expand the policy choices on the menu outside of simple vested interests and allow for equilibriums which were previously not possible. Dani Rodrik of the Harvard Kennedy School provides several examples of this phenomenon, where both Elites and Non-Elites were made better off through policy innovation, or in the case of the democratization of South Africa, making commitments to avoid Hold-up problems.[32]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_choice&amp;oldid=780790157"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Institutional economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behaviour. Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen's instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the ceremonial sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 American Economic Review article by Walton H. Hamilton.[1][2]</p><p>Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics.[3]</p><p>A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the Legal Foundations of Capitalism by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there is heated debate on the role of law (formal institution) on economic growth.[4] Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior.</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assume stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium). It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons.[5] Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically-bounded social system; other institutionalist economists[who?] disagree with Marx's definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals.</p><p>Traditional institutionalism rejects the reduction of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy).[6] Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world-views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley.)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The vacillations of institutions are necessarily a result of the very incentives created by such institutions, and are thus endogenous. Emphatically, traditional institutionalism is in many ways a response to the current economic orthodoxy; its reintroduction in the form of institutionalist political economy is thus an explicit challenge to neoclassical economics, since it is based on the fundamental premise that neoclassicists oppose: that economics cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded.</p><p>Some of the authors associated with this school include Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Mark Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Thorstein Veblen</h2><p> Main articles: Thorstein Veblen and The Theory of the Leisure Class</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Veblen3a.jpg/220px-Veblen3a.jpg" width="220" height="288"><p>


		Thorstein Veblen came from a Norwegian immigrant family in rural Mid-western America.


		</p><p>
			Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929) wrote his first and most influential book while he was at the University of Chicago, on The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899).[7] In it he analyzed the motivation in capitalism to conspicuously consume their riches as a way of demonstrating success. Conspicuous leisure was another focus of Veblen's critique. The concept of conspicuous consumption was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.</p><p>In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of profiteering, did not advocate change.</p><p>Through the 1920s and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Thorstein Veblen's warnings of the tendency for wasteful consumption and the necessity of creating sound financial institutions seemed to ring true. Veblen remains a leading critic, which cautions against the excesses of the American way.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1898 an article entitled Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science[8] and he became the precursor of current evolutionary economics.</p><h2>John R. Commons</h2><p> Main article: John R. Commons</p><p>John R. Commons (1862–1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in Institutional Economics (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes.</p><p>Commons thought that government should be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.</p><h2>Wesley Mitchell</h2><p> Main article: Wesley Mitchell</p><p>Wesley Clair Mitchell (August 5, 1874 – October 29, 1948) was an American economist known for his empirical work on business cycles and for guiding the National Bureau of Economic Research in its first decades. Mitchell’s teachers included economists Thorstein Veblen and J. L. Laughlin and philosopher John Dewey.</p><h2>Clarence Ayres</h2><p> Main article: Clarence Edwin Ayres</p><p>Clarence Ayres (May 6, 1891 – July 24, 1972) was the principal thinker of what some has called the Texas school of institutional economics. Ayres developed on the ideas of Thorstein Veblen with a dichotomy of technology and institutions to separate the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structures. He claimed that technology was always one step ahead of the socio-cultural institutions.</p><p>It can be argued that Ayres was not an institutionalist in any normal sense of the term; since he identified institutions with sentiments and superstition and in consequence institutions only played a kind of residual role in this theory of development which core center was that of technology. Ayres was under strong influence of Hegel and institutions for Ayres had the same function as Schein (with the connotation of deception, and illusion) for Hegel. A more appropriate name for Ayres' position would be that of a techno-behaviorist rather than an institutionalist.</p><h2>Adolf Berle</h2><p> Main article: Adolf Berle</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg/220px-Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg" width="220" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr.


		</p><p id="lastLine">
			Adolf A. Berle (1895–1971) was one of the first authors to combine legal and economic analysis, and his work stands as a foundig pillar of thought in modern corporate governance. Like Keynes, Berle was at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but subsequently resigned from his diplomatic job dissatisfied with the Versailles Treaty terms. In his book with Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account.</p><p>Directors of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered.</p><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Delaware Valley</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

				This article is about the Philadelphia metropolitan area. For other uses, see Delaware Valley (disambiguation).</p><p>The Delaware Valley is the valley through which the Delaware River flows. By extension, this toponym is commonly used to refer to Greater Philadelphia or Philadelphia metropolitan area (the [Lower] Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area), which straddles the Lower Delaware River just north of its estuary. The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is located at the southern part of the Northeast megalopolis and as such, the Delaware Valley can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is composed of several counties in southeastern Pennsylvania and southwestern New Jersey, one county in northern Delaware and one county in northeastern Maryland. The MSA has a population of over 6 million, while the CSA has a population of over 7.1 million (as of the 2010 Census Bureau count). Philadelphia, being the region's major commercial, cultural, and industrial center, wields a rather large sphere of influence that affects the counties that immediately surround it.</p><p>Some of the Delaware Valley's most well-known contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education and medical institutions. The Delaware Valley has been influential upon American history and industry. The region are leaders in higher education, biotechnology, medicine, tourism and many others. With a gross domestic product of $388&nbsp;billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation.[3]</p><p>The area has hosted many people and sites significant to American culture and history, particularly in the arts, where Philadelphia alone has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city[4], politics, including many influential people involved in politics such as Benjamin Franklin and Joe Biden, and the American Revolution. Philadelphia is famously known as The Birthplace of America[5] as the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were both drafted and signed there. On December&nbsp;7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution, and has since promoted itself as The First State.[6]</p><p>The Delaware Valley was home many other instrumental moments in the American Revolution , including the First and Second Continental Congress, the preservation of the Liberty Bell, the Battles of Germantown, Brandywine, and Red Bank, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, the winter of 1777–78 at Valley Forge, the Philadelphia Convention, and many others. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today, the area is home to some of the most prestigious universities in the world, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, and Temple University.[7] The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is consistently ranked as the best business school in the world.[8]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>In geology and geography, a strict sense of the term would incorporate the Delaware River's main drainage basin, and so encompass major tributaries such as the Schuylkill River and Lehigh River and their valleys or sub-basins. These extensions also apply culturally with decreasing degree gradually decreased by proximal distance because the ease of land travel enables a great deal of daily interaction; for example, the large number of commuters who travel daily 45–90 minutes creates cultural blends and parallel values.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/DelawareRiverBasin-01.png/200px-DelawareRiverBasin-01.png" width="200" height="232"><br><p>The drainage basin of the Delaware River.</p><h2>Population and economy[edit]</h2><p>As of March 2011, the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD Metropolitan Statistical Area[9] constitutes the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States.[10][11][12] Its CSA ranks 8th.</p><p>Based on commuter flows, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also defines a wider labor market region that adds Berks County, Pennsylvania to the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, bringing the total metropolitan population to 6.53 million.</p><p>Philadelphia's media market ranks fourth, behind New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, in Nielsen Media Market size rankings. It also borders the New York metropolitan area located directly to the north of this area.</p><p>Such educational institutions as Delaware Valley Regional High School in Alexandria Township and Delaware Valley College in Doylestown Township are named after the region. Likewise, Frenchtown's now defunct newspaper The Delaware Valley News was another example of the usage.</p><h3>Counties making up the Delaware Valley[edit]</h3><p>See also: Metropolitan Statistical Areas of New Jersey

Within the Hispanic population, the vast majority are Puerto Ricans, though other groups include Dominicans and Mexicans.[17] There is a significant West Indian community. There is even a small Native American community known as Lenapehoking for Lenni-Lenape Indians of West Philadelphia.</p><p>Philadelphia's suburbs contain a high concentration of malls, the two largest of which have at least 5,000,000 square feet (460,000&nbsp;m2) of office space, and at least 600,000 square feet (56,000&nbsp;m2) of retail. These are the King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is the largest in the United States (leasable sq. feet of retail space), and the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was the first enclosed mall on the East Coast. Malls, office complexes, strip shopping plazas, expressways, and tract housing are common sights, and more and more continue to replace rolling countryside, farms, woods, and wetlands. However, due to strong opposition by residents and political officials, many acres of land have been preserved throughout the Delaware Valley. Older townships and large boroughs such as Cheltenham, Norristown, Jenkintown, Upper Darby and West Chester retain distinct community identities while engulfed in suburbia. The fastest-growing counties[when?] are Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, and Gloucester. Upper Darby, in Delaware County is the largest township in the United States.[citation needed] Sometimes Reading is included in the Delaware Valley Metro Area.[citation needed]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>The Delaware Valley has four distinct seasons with ample precipitation and is divided by the 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) January isotherm. Most of Philadelphia and the NJ portion, almost all of the DE and MD portions, part of Delaware County, and extreme southern portions of Bucks and Chester Counties have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and normally do vary widely within the Delaware Valley. The region has only two ski areas: Bear Creek Ski and Recreation Area in eastern Berks County and Spring Mountain in central Montgomery County.</p><p>Using the -3&nbsp;°C January isotherm as a boundary, all of the Delaware Valley is humid subtropical except for portions of Berks County and higher areas of northern Chester County. The warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) only exists in higher areas of Berks where all monthly temperatures average below 22&nbsp;°C.</p><h2>Colonial history[edit]</h2><p>See also: Thirteen Colonies</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The valley was the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape, who are recalled in place names throughout the region. The region became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland after the exploration of Delaware Bay in 1609. The Dutch called the Delaware River the Zuyd Rivier, or South River, and considered the lands along it banks and those of its bay to be the southern flank of its province of New Netherland. In 1638, it began to be settled by Swedes, Forest Finns, Dutch, and Walloons and became the colony of New Sweden, though this was not officially recognized by the Dutch Empire which re-asserted control in 1655. The area was taken by the English in 1664.[31] The name Delaware comes from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who had arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1610, just as original settlers were about to abandon it, and thus maintaining the English foothold on the North American continent.</p><h2>Transportation[edit]</h2><p>Many residents commute to jobs in Philadelphia, Camden, and Wilmington with the help of expressways and trains. Commutes from one suburb to another are also common, as office parks have sprung up in new commercial centers such as King of Prussia, Fort Washington, Cherry Hill, and Plymouth Meeting.</p><h3>Commuter rail[edit]</h3><p>Formerly, the region was served by the Delaware Valley Railway.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Thirty_St_Station.jpg/220px-Thirty_St_Station.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Philadelphia's 30th St. Station has SEPTA Regional Rail and Amtrak service</p><h3>Major highways[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/I-95_SB_approaching_Girard_Avenue-Lehigh_Avenue.JPG/220px-I-95_SB_approaching_Girard_Avenue-Lehigh_Avenue.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Traffic heading into Philadelphia on Interstate 95.</p><p>Pennsylvania</p><p>New Jersey</p><p>Delaware</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often subdivided into Asia and Europe (red shades), while North and South America are sometimes recognised as one American continent (green shades).</p><p>A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[1]</p><p>Geologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).</p><p>Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions.

The criterion large leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is deemed the smallest continent.</p><p>Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]</p><h3>Extent[edit]</h3><p>The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as the Continent) is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.</p><p>From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]</p><p>From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Island_nations.svg/300px-Island_nations.svg.png" width="300" height="154"><br><p>Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.</p><p>As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]</p><h3>Separation[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Boundaries between the continents of Earth
See also: List of transcontinental countries</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as more or less discrete masses of land.[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.</p><p>North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.</p><p>The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]</p><p>If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.</p><p>When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia–New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.</p><h3>Number[edit]</h3><p> There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:</p><p>The term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.</p><h2>Highest and lowest points[edit]</h2><p>See also: Extremes on Earth, Extreme points of Earth, and Seven Summits</p><p>The following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.</p><p>† The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (-1,512 metres (-4,961&nbsp;ft)[27]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (-2,540 metres (-8,330&nbsp;ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some sources list the Kuma–Manych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc (elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe - the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.</p><h2>Other divisions[edit]</h2><h3>Supercontinents[edit]</h3><p>Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.</p><h3>Subcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[28] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[28]</p><p>In many of these cases, the subcontinents concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[29] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[30][31] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.</p><p>Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[32][33][34] or three (with Central America being the third).[35][36] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[28]</p><h3>Submerged continents[edit]</h3><p>Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.</p><h3>Microcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as the eighth continent from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[37]</p><h3>Botanical continents[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/WGSRPD_World.svg/300px-WGSRPD_World.svg.png" width="300" height="164"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>"Botanical continents" defined by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.</p><p>Continents may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine botanical continents. Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[38]</p><h2>History of continental configurations[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Geological history of the Earth</p><h2>History of the concept[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Strabo.jpg/187px-Strabo.jpg" width="187" height="226"><br><p>The Ancient Greek geographer Strabo holding a globe showing Europa and Asia</p><h3>Early concepts of the Old World continents[edit]</h3><p>The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[39] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[40] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and ...&nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...[39]</p><p>Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[41] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[42] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[43] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[44] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (Libya) and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[45] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.</p><p>Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them islands. Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents peninsulas. These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[46]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Medieval T and O map showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah—Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham).</p><p>Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away.[47]</p><h3>European arrival in the Americas[edit]</h3><p>Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.</p><p>In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[48] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (New World), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[49] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[50] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa,[51] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.</p><p>Within a few years the name New World began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[50]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg/375px-Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg" width="375" height="208"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia</p><p>In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named America after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[52] On the map, the word America was placed on part of South America.</p><h3>The word continent[edit]</h3><p>From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[53] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[54] The noun was used to mean a connected or continuous tract of land or mainland.[53] It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[53] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three parts of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[55]</p><p>While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa. In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new. And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.[56] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as parts of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png/250px-Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png" width="250" height="198"><br><p>Hollandia Nova, 1659 map prepared by Joan Blaeu based on voyages by Abel Tasman and Willem Jansz, this image shows a French edition of 1663</p><h3>Beyond four continents[edit]</h3><p>From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[57]</p><p>Europeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[57] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[58]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Antarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great Antarctic (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[59]</p><p>From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[60]</p><p>From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[60] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]</p><p>Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[61] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Continental crust and Plate tectonics</p><p>Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian shield, typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are high and dry; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[62]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg/350px-Plates_tect2_en.svg.png" width="350" height="239"><br><p>The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal rafts that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.</p><p>There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[63][64] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.</p><p>Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (continental rocks, plate boundaries) are used as appropriate.</p><p>The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.[65][66] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes;[4] its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.[1] The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>For much of European history, the north polar regions remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. Pytheas of Massilia recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called Eschate Thule, where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance on which one can neither walk nor sail. He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as growlers or bergy bits; his Thule was probably Norway, though the Faroe Islands or Shetland have also been suggested.[5]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg/220px-Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg" width="220" height="189"><br><p>Emanuel Bowen's 1780s map of the Arctic features a "Northern Ocean".</p><p>Early cartographers were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in Johannes Ruysch's map of 1507, or Gerardus Mercator's map of 1595) or water (as with Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the Northern Sea Route or the Northwest Passage, to Cathay (China) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as Johann Homann featured an extensive Oceanus Septentrionalis at the northern edge of their charts.</p><p>The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the Arctic Circle in this era added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of navigational charts, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the myth of an Open Polar Sea was persistent. John Barrow, longtime Second Secretary of the British Admiralty, promoted exploration of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.</p><p>In the United States in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers Elisha Kane and Isaac Israel Hayes both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority Matthew Fontaine Maury included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook The Physical Geography of the Sea (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who travelled closer and closer to the pole reported, the polar ice cap is quite thick, and persists year-round.</p><p>Fridtjof Nansen was the first to make a nautical crossing of the Arctic Ocean, in 1896. The first surface crossing of the ocean was led by Wally Herbert in 1969, in a dog sled expedition from Alaska to Svalbard, with air support.[6] The first nautical transit of the north pole was made in 1958 by the submarine USS Nautilus, and the first surface nautical transit occurred in 1977 by the icebreaker NS Arktika.</p><p>Since 1937, Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations have extensively monitored the Arctic Ocean.

The Russian continental shelf consists of three separate, smaller shelves, the Barents Shelf, Chukchi Sea Shelf and Siberian Shelf. Of these three, the Siberian Shelf is the largest such shelf in the world. The Siberian Shelf holds large oil and gas reserves, and the Chukchi shelf forms the border between Russian and the United States as stated in the USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement. The whole area is subject to international territorial claims.</p><h3>Underwater features[edit]</h3><p>An underwater ridge, the Lomonosov Ridge, divides the deep sea North Polar Basin into two oceanic basins: the Eurasian Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500&nbsp;m (13,100 and 14,800&nbsp;ft) deep, and the Amerasian Basin (sometimes called the North American, or Hyperborean Basin), which is about 4,000&nbsp;m (13,000&nbsp;ft) deep. The bathymetry of the ocean bottom is marked by fault block ridges, abyssal plains, ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038&nbsp;m (3,406&nbsp;ft).[13] The deepest point is Litke Deep in the Eurasian Basin, at 5,450&nbsp;m (17,880&nbsp;ft).</p><p>The two major basins are further subdivided by ridges into the Canada Basin (between Alaska/Canada and the Alpha Ridge), Makarov Basin (between the Alpha and Lomonosov Ridges), Amundsen Basin (between Lomonosov and Gakkel ridges), and Nansen Basin (between the Gakkel Ridge and the continental shelf that includes the Franz Josef Land).</p><h2>Oceanography[edit]</h2><h3>Water flow[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg/650px-BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg.png" width="650" height="200"><p>Distribution of the major water mass in the Arctic Ocean.

It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams (Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Mackenzie), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called halocline, in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Copepodkils.jpg/250px-Copepodkils.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>A Copepod</p><p>Because of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It is classified as a mediterranean sea, which as “a part of the world ocean which has only limited communication with the major ocean basins (these being the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans) and where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing”.[14] The Arctic Ocean has a total volume of 18.07×106 km3, equal to about 1.3% of the World Ocean. Mean surface circulation is predominately cyclonic on the Eurasian side and anticyclonic in the Canadian Basin.[15]</p><p>Water enters from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can be divided into three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around 900 metres (3,000 feet) depth.[14] It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow Bering Strait at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the Chukchi Sea.[16] During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4&nbsp;cm/s.[15] This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a halocline.[17]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png/220px-Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png" width="220" height="156"><br><p>The Kennedy Channel.</p><p>This water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.[14] Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the depth range of 150–900 metres (490–2,950 feet) is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the North Atlantic Current enters through the Fram Strait, cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the Arctic Basin counter-clockwise. This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.[16] It flows slowly, at about 0.02&nbsp;m/s.[14] Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&nbsp;°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density.[14] When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the Beaufort Gyre. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.[17]</p><p>The final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from 150–200 metres (490–660 feet). The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the Siberian Shelf.[14] As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3-0.6&nbsp;m/s.[14] Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.</p><p>Waters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard Island, which is about 2,700 metres (8,900 feet) deep and 350 kilometres (220 miles) wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.[16] The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the Coriolis force, which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the Norwegian Current on the eastern side.[14] Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the Hudson Strait (1-2 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.[16]</p><p>As noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses. With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.[15] During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the Icelandic Low, which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer. These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months. There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.[15]</p><h3>Sea ice[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg/300px-2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg" width="300" height="251"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Sea cover in the Arctic Ocean, showing the median, 2005 and 2007 coverage [18]


Main article: Arctic ice pack</p><p>Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the ice has been decreasing since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000&nbsp;km2 (6,023,200&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) at a rate of 3% per decade. The seasonal variations are about 7,000,000&nbsp;km2 (2,702,700&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) with the maximum in April and minimum in September. The sea ice is affected by wind and ocean currents, which can move and rotate very large areas of ice. Zones of compression also arise, where the ice piles up to form pack ice.[19][20][21]</p><p>Icebergs occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island, and icebergs are formed from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. These icebergs pose a hazard to ships, of which the Titanic is one of the most famous. Permafrost is found on most islands. The ocean is virtually icelocked from October to June, and the superstructure of ships are subject to icing from October to May.[11] Before the advent of modern icebreakers, ships sailing the Arctic Ocean risked being trapped or crushed by sea ice (although the Baychimo drifted through the Arctic Ocean untended for decades despite these hazards).</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>See also: Climate change in the Arctic</p><br><img alt="File:North Pole Sea Ice 1990-1999.ogv" style="width:210px;height:158px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv/210px--North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv.jpg"><p>Play media


Changes in ice between 1990–1999</p><p>Under the influence of the Quaternary glaciation, the Arctic Ocean is contained in a polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by the polar night, extreme cold, frequent low-level temperature inversions, and stable weather conditions.[22] Cyclones are only common on the Atlantic side.[23] Summers are characterized by continuous daylight (midnight sun), and temperatures can rise above the melting point (0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F). Cyclones are more frequent in summer and may bring rain or snow.[23] It is cloudy year-round, with mean cloud cover ranging from 60% in winter to over 80% in summer.[24]</p><p>The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Because the Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater, the temperature must reach -1.8&nbsp;°C (28.8&nbsp;°F) before freezing occurs.</p><p>The density of sea water, in contrast to fresh water, increases as it nears the freezing point and thus it tends to sink. It is generally necessary that the upper 100–150&nbsp;m (330–490&nbsp;ft) of ocean water cools to the freezing point for sea ice to form.[25] In the winter the relatively warm ocean water exerts a moderating influence, even when covered by ice. This is one reason why the Arctic does not experience the extreme temperatures seen on the Antarctic continent.</p><p>There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50&nbsp;cm (7.9 to 19.7&nbsp;in) over the frozen ocean.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20&nbsp;°C (50–68&nbsp;°F).[26] The surface waters of the northernmost[27] Arctic Ocean warmed, seasonally at least, enough to support tropical lifeforms[28] requiring surface temperatures of over 22&nbsp;°C (72&nbsp;°F).[29]</p><h2>Animal and plant life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg/220px-Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Three polar bears approach USS Honolulu near the North Pole.</p><p>Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem which is slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage.[11] Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean.</p><p>The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton.[30] Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[31] During summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to photosynthesize for long periods of time and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter when they struggle to get enough light to survive.[31]</p><h2>Natural resources[edit]</h2><p>See also: Natural resources of the Arctic, Territorial claims in the Arctic, and Marine mammal</p><p>Petroleum and natural gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, fish, seals and whales can all be found in abundance in the region.[11][21]</p><p>The political dead zone near the centre of the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark.[32] It is significant for the global energy market because it may hold 25% or more of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources.[33]</p><h2>Environmental concerns[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: Climate change in the Arctic, Ozone depletion, and Pollution in the Arctic Ocean</p><h3>Arctic ice melting[edit]</h3><p>The Arctic ice pack is thinning, and in many years there is also a seasonal hole in the ozone layer.[34] Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism.[21][35] Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free for the first time in human history within a few years or by 2040.[36][37] Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.[38]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.[35]</p><p>As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.[39]</p><h3>Clathrate breakdown[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Clathrate gun hypothesis</p><br><img alt="Extinction intensity.svg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Extinction_intensity.svg/320px-Extinction_intensity.svg.png" width="320" height="195" usemap="#ImageMap_1_838532597"><p>Marine extinction intensity during the Phanerozoic

Melting of this ice may release large quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, causing further warming in a strong positive feedback cycle and; marine genus and species to become extinct.[40][41]</p><h3>Other concerns[edit]</h3><p>Other environmental concerns relate to the radioactive contamination of the Arctic Ocean from, for example, Russian radioactive waste dump sites in the Kara Sea[42] and Cold War nuclear test sites such as Novaya Zemlya.[43] In addition, Shell planned to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas during the summer of 2012, which environmental groups filed a lawsuit about in an attempt to protect native communities, endangered wildlife, and the Arctic Ocean in the event of a major oil spill.[44]</p><p>On July 16, 2015, five nations (United States of America, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark/Greenland) signed a declaration committing to keep their fishing vessels out of a 1.1 million square mile zone in the central Arctic Ocean near the North Pole.

Except in Australia, the authorities use a minimum urban density definition of 400 persons per square kilometer (or the nearly identical 1,000 per square mile in the United States). Demographia uses maps, satellite photographs to estimate continuous urbanization. Demographia also uses small area population data, where available, to match population estimates to urbanized land area. National census authority data are presented in Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

This is evident, for example, in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Seoul and Moscow, where the UN data are for political jurisdictions, rather than urban areas. In other cases, the UN data is for metropolitan area, which are larger than urban areas (such as in Brazil). Finally, the United Nations data is incomplete, excluding some significant urban areas (such as Essen–Düsseldorf in Germany).[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Urban areas are confined to a single nation, unless there is freedom of movement (including labor) between the adjacent nations.

Thus, Detroit–Windsor in both the United States and Canada, and San Diego–Tijuana in both the United States and Mexico are not treated as single urban areas. Moreover, Shenzhen–Hong Kong is treated as separate urban areas, principally because labor movement between the two is limited, with the former within China and the latter a special administrative region of China.[citation needed]</p><p>According to the report, there are 875 identified urban areas in the world with 500,000 or more population as of 2013.

Main article: Long Island</p><p>Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region wholly within both the U.S. state of New York and the New York City metropolitan area. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, most people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term Long Island (or The Island) exclusively to refer to the Nassau-Suffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character.[44] North of the island is Long Island Sound, across which are the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p><p>With a Census-estimated population of 7,838,722 in 2015, constituting nearly 40% of New York State's population,[45][46][47][48][49] The majority of New York City residents, 58% as of 2015, now live on Long Island, namely the estimated the 4,896,398 residents living in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.[50] Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 17th-most populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaido). Its population density is 5,571 inhabitants per square mile (2,151/km2). If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first in population density. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[51][52] The Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, with an estimated population of 770,367 in 2016, is the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside of New York City.[43]</p><p>Long Island is the most populated island in the United States and the 17th most populous island in the world. Known especially for recreation, boating and miles of public beaches, including numerous town, county and state parks and Fire Island National Seashore. Along the north shore, the Gold Coast of Long Island is an upscale section of Nassau and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th century, of which only a few remain preserved as historic sites. The East End of Long Island (known as the Twin Forks because of its physical shape) boasts open spaces for farmland and wineries. The South Fork, in particular, comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as The Hamptons and has an international reputation as a playground for the rich and famous, with some of the wealthiest communities in the United States. In 2015, according to Business Insider, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S. by real estate-listings site Property Shark, with a median home sale price of $5,125,000.[53] During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside in mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying the beaches, gardens, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Long Island is served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway being major east-west routes across significant portions of the island. Passenger rail access is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Long Island Rail Road, one of the largest commuter railroads in the United States. Air travel needs are served by several airports. Within Queens, the island is home to John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, two of the three major airline hubs serving the New York City area (with Newark Liberty International Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey).

Lower Hudson Valley[edit]
Main article: Hudson Valley</p><p>Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, and quaint small towns and villages, the Lower Hudson Valley is centered around the Hudson River north of New York City and lies within New York State. Its two most populous counties, Westchester and Rockland, are located on the eastern and western sides of the river, respectively, connected by the heavily trafficked Tappan Zee Bridge (a major commuter route from Rockland County towards New York City) as well as the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region's rail commuters. Southern Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains. Although many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence and expense (some examples: Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Katonah, and Briarcliff Manor), the Lower Hudson Valley as a whole is one of the fastest-growing areas in the metropolitan area because of high housing costs in New York City and the inner suburbs.</p><p>Historically, the valley was home to many factories, including paper mills, but a significant number have closed.

<div class="content"><p>From the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the Age of Discovery, and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the Great Divergence, a term coined by Samuel Huntington[58] the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.</p><h3>Modern era[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg/170px-Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg" width="170" height="206"><br><p>The United States Constitution</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg/170px-Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_La_libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple.jpg" width="170" height="135"><br><p>La Liberté guidant le Peuple by French painter Eugène Delacroix</p><p>Coming into the modern era, the historical understanding of the East-West contrast—as the opposition of Christendom to its geographical neighbors—began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The Age of Discovery faded into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the Catholic Church; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism.</p><p>Philosophers of the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Voltaire (1694–1778), David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.[59] influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as enlightened absolutism. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by Voltaire spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the scientific revolution, spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of modern science, during which developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.[60][61][62][63][64][65] While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution, and its completion is attributed to the grand synthesis of Newton's 1687 Principia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools.[66] These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.[67]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/220px-Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>A Watt steam engine. The steam engine, made of iron and fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world.[68]</p><p>The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.[69][70][71] The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[72][73][74][75] GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy,[76] while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies.[77] Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants[78] and fire.</p><p>The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories.[79][80][81]</p><h2>Arts and humanities[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg/220px-Bayeux_Tapestry_scene44_William_Odo_Robert.jpg" width="220" height="243"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry showing William the Conqueror (centre), his half-brothers Robert, Count of Mortain (right) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux in the Duchy of Normandy (left).

This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.[83]</p><p>The symphony, concerto, sonata, opera, and oratorio have their origins in Italy. Many important musical instruments used by cultures all over the world were also developed in the West; among them are the violin, piano, pipe organ, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, accordion, and the theremin. The solo piano, symphony orchestra, and the string quartet are also important performing musical forms.</p><p>Many forms of popular music have been derived from African-Americans, and their innovations of jazz and blues serve as the basis from which much of modern popular music derives.

These include jazz, blues and rock music (that in a wider sense include the rock and roll and heavy metal genres), rhythm and blues, funk, hip hop, techno as well as the ska and reggae genres from Jamaica.

Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the Hellenistic world and in Heian Japan. Both Petronius' Satyricon (c. 60 CE) and the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.</p><p>Tragedy, from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical opera.</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg/260px-Rozeta_Pary%C5%BC_notre-dame_chalger.jpg" width="260" height="260"><br><p>Rayonnant rose window in Notre Dame de Paris.

The scientific method as a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses was almost entirely fashioned by the Italian Galileo Galilei.[90][91]</p><p>The Western World has been the leading force in the technological and scientific disciplines: whether measured in people or events, 97 percent of accomplishment in the scientific inventories occurred in Europe and North America. The Dictionary of Scientific Biography (DoSB) sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies, concluded that Eighty-one percent of the most significant scientists and mathematicians come from Europe compared to 76 percent in the Human Accomplishment set, numbers that rise to 94 and 91 percent respectively when the United States and Canada are included.[92] The United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy alone account for 72 percent of all the significant scientific figures in science from 1400 to 1950. Add in Russia and the Netherlands, and 80 percent of all significant figures are accounted for.[93]</p><p>By the will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel the Nobel Prize were established in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[94] The percentage of ethnically European noble prize winners during the first and second halves of the 20th century were respectively 98 and 94 percent.[95] A study by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) - Japan's equivalent of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) concluded that 54% of the world's most important inventions were British. Of the rest, 25% were American and 5% Japanese.[96]</p><p>It was the West that first developed steam power and adapted its use into factories, and for the generation of electric power.[97][98] The electrical motor, dynamo, transformer, and electric light, and indeed most of the familiar electrical appliances, were inventions of the West.[99][100][101][102] The Otto and the Diesel internal combustion engines are products whose genesis and early development were in the West.[103][104] Nuclear power stations are derived from the first atomic pile constructed in Chicago in 1942.[105]</p><p>Communication devices and systems including the telegraph, the telephone, radio, television, communications and navigation satellites, mobile phone, and the Internet were all invented by Westerners.[106][107][108][109][110][111][112][113] The pencil, ballpoint pen, Cathode ray tube, liquid-crystal display, light-emitting diode, camera, photocopier, laser printer, ink jet printer, plasma display screen and world wide web were also invented in the West.[114][115][116][117][118][119]</p><p>Ubiquitous materials including concrete, aluminium, clear glass, synthetic rubber, synthetic diamond and the plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene were invented in the West. Iron and steel ships, bridges and skyscrapers first appeared in the West. Nitrogen fixation and petrochemicals were invented by Westerners. Most of the elements, were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary atomic theories to explain them.[citation needed]</p><p>The transistor, integrated circuit, memory chip, and computer were all first seen in the West. The ship's chronometer, the screw propeller, the locomotive, bicycle, automobile, and airplane were all invented in the West. Eyeglasses, the telescope, the microscope and electron microscope, all the varieties of chromatography, protein and DNA sequencing, computerised tomography, Nuclear magnetic resonance, x-rays, and light, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories.[citation needed]</p><p>In medicine, the pure antibiotics were created in the West. The method of preventing Rh disease, the treatment of diabetes, and the germ theory of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of smallpox, was led by a Westerner, Donald Henderson. Radiography, Computed tomography, Positron emission tomography and Medical ultrasonography are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of clinical chemistry including the methods of spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay were first devised by Westerners. So were the stethoscope, electrocardiograph, and the endoscope. Vitamins, hormonal contraception, hormones, insulin, Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, along with a host of other medically proven drugs were first utilized to treat disease in the West. The double-blind study and evidence-based medicine are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In mathematics, calculus, statistics, logic, vectors, tensors and complex analysis, group theory and topology were developed by Westerners.[120][121][122][123][124][125][126] In biology, evolution, chromosomes, DNA, genetics and the methods of molecular biology are creatures of the West. In physics, the science of mechanics and quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics were all developed by Westerners. The discoveries and inventions by Westerners in electromagnetism include Coulomb's law (1785), the first battery (1800), the unity of electricity and magnetism (1820), Biot–Savart law (1820), Ohm's Law (1827), and the Maxwell's equations (1871). The atom, nucleus, electron, neutron and proton were all unveiled by Westerners.[citation needed]</p><p>In business, economics, and finance, double entry bookkeeping, credit card, and the charge card were all first used in the West.[127][128]</p><p>Westerners are also known for their explorations of the globe and outer space. The first expedition to circumnavigate the Earth (1522) was by Westerners, as well as the first journey to the South Pole (1911), and the first moon landing (1969).[129][130] The landing of robots on Mars (2004 and 2012) and on an asteroid (2001), the Voyager 2 explorations of the outer planets (Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989), Voyager 1's passage into interstellar space (2013), and New Horizons' flyby of Pluto (2015) were significant recent Western achievements.[131][132][133][134][135]</p><h2>Media[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Western media</p><p>The Western media refers to the news media of the Western world. The roots of the Western media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when printing presses began to operate throughout Western Europe. The emergence of news media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press, from which the publishing press derives its name.[136]</p><p>In the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of Latin in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the discoveries arising from trade and travel, navigation to the new world, science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in Western Europe.[137]</p><p>After the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the U.S. launching Telstar in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in America in 1975.[138]</p><p>Beginning in the 1990s, the Internet has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages (magazines, CDs, television and radio slots), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items (articles, audio and video files).[139]</p><h2>Religion[edit]</h2><p>The native religions of Europe were polytheistic but not homogenous—however they were similar insofar as they were predominantly Indo-European in origin. Roman religion was similar to but not the same as Hellenic religion—likewise the same for indigenous Germanic polytheism, Celtic polytheism and Slavic polytheism. Western culture, for at least the last 1000 years, has been considered nearly synonymous with Christian culture.[140] Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards.</p><p>Western culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians. The notion of Europe and the Western World has been intimately connected with the concept of Christianity and Christendom many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.[17]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As in other areas, Judaism is found in the Western world. Minority groups, and Jews in particular, often had to contend with discrimination and persecution. This could include being subjected to violence and/or destruction of property (this may be referred to as a pogrom) as well as being expelled or banned from various polities, hoping to find havens in other places.[141]</p><p>Religion has waned considerably in Europe, where many are today irreligious, agnostic or atheist and they make up about 18% of the European population.[142] In terms of irreligion, over half of the populations of the Czech Republic (79% of the population was agnostic, atheist or irreligious), the United Kingdom (~25%),[143] Germany (25–33%),[144] France (30–35%)[145][146][147] and the Netherlands (39–44%) are agnostic, atheist, or otherwise non-religious.</p><p>However, per another survey by Pew Research Center from 2011, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world where 70–84% are Christians,[148] According to this survey, 76% of Europeans described themselves as Christians,[148][149][150] and about 86% of the Americas population identified themselves as Christians,[151] (90% in Latin America and 77% in North America).[152] And 73% in Oceania are self-identify as Christian, and 76% in South Africa is Christian.[148]</p><p>According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population.[153] Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU population, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%.[154] Non believer/Agnostic account 16%,[153] Atheist account's 7%,[153] and Muslim 2%.[153]</p><p>Throughout the Western world there are increasing numbers of people who seek to revive the indigenous religions of their European ancestors, such groups include Germanic, Roman, Hellenic, Celtic and Slavic, polytheistic reconstructionist movements, likewise, Wicca, new age spirituality and other neo-pagan belief systems enjoy notable minority support in Western nations.</p><h2>Sport[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Bull-leaping.jpg/220px-Bull-leaping.jpg" width="220" height="119"><br><p>The Bull-Leaping Fresco from the Great Palace at Knossos, Crete.

A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at Athens in 1896.</p><p>The Romans built immense structures such as the Colisseum in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for blood sports, such as the infamous Gladiatorial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of Classical Antiquity—such as Greco-Roman wrestling, discus and javelin. The sport of bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice and is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its Central and South American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.</p><p>Jousting and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the Middle Ages, and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of the popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. The Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence—these include Ping Pong, modern tennis, Association Football, Netball and Rugby.</p><p>Football (also known as soccer) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the world game. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the Rugby World Cup has been shared among the Western nations of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.</p><p>Australian Rules Football, an Australian variation of football with similarities to Gaelic football and rugby evolved in the British colony of Victoria in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of baseball to America during the colonial period. The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Many games known as football were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, the Father of American Football. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. From these American origins, basketball has become one of the great international participation sports.</p><p>Professionalism in sport in the West became prevalent during the 20th Century, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans began following the exploits of professional athletes through radio, television, and the internet—all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.</p><h2>Themes and traditions[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg/220px-Anonymous_Madonna_with_big_breasts.jpg" width="220" height="279"><br><p>A Madonna and Child painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas.</p><p>Western culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:[citation needed]</p><h3>Notes[edit]</h3><h3> [edit]</h3><br><img alt="Page semi-protected" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png" width="20" height="20"><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Africa</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square&nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4% of its total land area.[2] With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population.[1] The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.[3]</p><p>Africa's average population is the youngest amongst all the continents;[4][5] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[6] Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.[7] Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.[8]</p><p>Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonised almost all of Africa. Africa also varies greatly with regard to environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. However, most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century. African nations have attempted to cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg/170px-Palazzo_Ferreria_statue_2.jpeg" width="170" height="228"><br><p>Statue representing Africa at Palazzo Ferreria, in Valletta, Malta</p><p>Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).[9][10] This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician ?afar 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis[11] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) cave, in reference to cave dwellers.[12] The same word[12] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[13]</p><p>Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[14] The Latin suffix -ica can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, located in modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.</p><p>According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while Asia was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.</p><p>Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name Africa:</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Africa

Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have evolved into modern man, such as Australopithecus afarensis (radiometrically dated to approximately 3.9–3.0&nbsp;million years BP,[20] Paranthropus boisei (c. 2.3–1.4&nbsp;million years BP)[21] and Homo ergaster (c. 1.9&nbsp;million–600,000 years BP) have been discovered.[2]</p><p>After the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers.[22][23][24] These first modern humans left Africa and populated the rest of the globe during the Out of Africa II migration dated to approximately 50,000 years BP, exiting the continent either across Bab-el-Mandeb over the Red Sea,[25][26] the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco,[27] or the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.[28]</p><p>Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in Southern Africa, Southeast Africa, North Africa, and the Sahara.[29]</p><p>The size of the Sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.[30] At the end of the Ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in Sub-Saharan Africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in Tassili n'Ajjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia.[31] However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.[32] The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.</p><p>The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.[33] In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from Algeria to Nubia.</p><p>Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.[34] This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of West Africa.[34]</p><p>By the first millennium BC, ironworking had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,[35] and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. Copper objects from Egypt, North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that Trans-Saharan trade networks had been established by this date.[34]</p><h3>Early civilizations</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Ancient African history</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg/220px-Abu_Simbel_Main_Temple_%282346939149%29.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Colossal statues of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt, date from around 1400 BC.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Bantu_expansion.png/170px-Bantu_expansion.png" width="170" height="180"><br><p>The origins and spread of the Bantu languages c. 1000 BC to c. 500 AD</p><p>At about 3300 BC, the historical record opens in Northern Africa with the rise of literacy in the Pharaonic civilization of Ancient Egypt.[36] One of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the Egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 BC.[37][38] Egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day Libya and Nubia, and, according to Martin Bernal, as far north as Crete.[39]</p><p>An independent centre of civilization with trading links to Phoenicia was established by Phoenicians from Tyre on the north-west African coast at Carthage.[40][41][42]</p><p>European exploration of Africa began with Ancient Greeks and Romans.[citation needed] In 332 BC, Alexander the Great was welcomed as a liberator in Persian-occupied Egypt. He founded Alexandria in Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty after his death.[43]</p><p>Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the Roman Empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first Roman emperor native to North Africa was Septimius Severus, born in Leptis Magna in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was Punic.[44]</p><p>Christianity spread across these areas at an early date, from Judaea via Egypt and beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia;[45] by AD 340 at the latest, it had become the state religion of the Aksumite Empire. Syro-Greek missionaries, who arrived by way of the Red Sea, were responsible for this theological development.[46]</p><p>In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.[47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Ninth to eighteenth centuries</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg/170px-Rytter_fra_Bagirmi.jpg" width="170" height="234"><br><p>African horseman of Baguirmi in full padded armour suit</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG/170px-Bronze_ornamental_staff_head%2C_9th_century%2C_Igbo-Ukwu.JPG" width="170" height="232"><br><p>The intricate 9th-century bronzes from Igbo-Ukwu, in Nigeria displayed a level of technical accomplishment that was notably more advanced than European bronze casting of the same period.[48]</p><p>Pre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities[49] characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule.

The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.</p><p>In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri.

The Ife model of government was adapted at the Oyo Empire, where its obas or kings, called the Alaafins of Oyo, once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.</p><p>The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that spread over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the eleventh century.[51] The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula who migrated westwards via Egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Their migration resulted in the fusion of the Arabs and Berbers, where the locals were Arabized,[52] and Arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of Islam.[53]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg/220px-Great_Zimbabwe_Closeup.jpg" width="220" height="132"><br><p>Ruins of Great Zimbabwe (eleventh to fifteenth centuries)</p><p>Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire in the region of middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.[54] By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cedid_Atlas_%28Africa%29_1803.jpg/220px-Cedid_Atlas_%28Africa%29_1803.jpg" width="220" height="184"><br><p>1803 Cedid Atlas, showing the Africa from the perspective of the Ottoman Empire.

Between the 15th and the 19th centuries (500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the New World.[57][58][59] More than 1 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.[60]</p><p>In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.[61]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg/220px-The_inspection_and_sale_of_a_slave.jpg" width="220" height="166"><br><p>Slave being inspected, from Captain Canot; or, Twenty Years of an African Slaver</p><p>Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against the usurping King of Lagos, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.[62] The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of legitimate commerce in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.[63]</p><h3>Colonialism and the Scramble for Africa</h3><p>Main article: Colonization of Africa

Egypt and Sudan were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922.</p><h3>Berlin Conference</h3><p>The Berlin Conference held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King Leopold II of Belgium, and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.</p><h3>Independence struggles</h3><p>Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France.[64] Ghana followed suit the next year (March 1957),[65] becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.</p><p>Portugal's overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, under the white minority government of Ian Smith, but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as Zimbabwe) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a bitter guerrilla war. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.</p><h3>Post-colonial Africa</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Mobutu_Sese_Seko_1973.jpg" width="140" height="186"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5 billion from his country.</p><p>Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.</p><p>Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/SADF-Operations_4.jpg/220px-SADF-Operations_4.jpg" width="220" height="177"><br><p>South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the South African Border War</p><p>Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund,[citation needed] also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In Rhodesia, Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the country's white government. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.[66][67][68] The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[69] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.</p><p>In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China,[70] which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as Africa Rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.[71]</p><h2>Geography</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Geography of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/187_1003703_africa_dxm.png/220px-187_1003703_africa_dxm.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Satellite photo of Africa.

Main article: African Union</p><p>The African Union (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002[84] as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.</p><p>The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan-African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.</p><p>Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg/450px-Supranational_African_Bodies-en.svg.png" width="450" height="405" usemap="#ImageMap_1_1093313515"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="The image above contains clickable links" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Interactive_icon.svg/18px-Interactive_icon.svg.png" title="The image above contains clickable links" width="18" height="27"><p>Euler diagram showing the relationships between various multinational African entities v • d • e</p><h2>Economy</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/RECs_of_the_AEC.svg/220px-RECs_of_the_AEC.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Map of the African Economic Community.

Main article: Economy of Africa
See also: Economy of the African Union and Water in Africa</p><p>Although it has abundant natural resources, Africa remains the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include corrupt governments that have often committed serious human rights violations, failed central planning, high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from guerrilla warfare to genocide).[85] According to the United Nations' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.[86]</p><p>Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent. In August 2008, the World Bank[87] announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day (versus the previous measure of $1.00). 80.5% of the Sub-Saharan Africa population was living on less than $2.50 (PPP) per day in 2005, compared with 85.7% for India.[88]</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of the population living in poverty in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people). The average poor person in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973,[89] indicating increasing poverty in some areas. Some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.[90][91][92]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. The continent is believed to hold 90% of the world's cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite,[93] 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium.[94] The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has 70% of the world's coltan, a mineral used in the production of tantalum capacitors for electronic devices such as cell phones. The DRC also has more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves.[95] Guinea is the world's largest exporter of bauxite.[96] As the growth in Africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. In fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis has pushed back 100 million people into food insecurity.[97]</p><p>In recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.[70]</p><p>A Harvard University study led by professor Calestous Juma showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.[98]</p><p>During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a US$7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.[99]</p><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Main article: Demographics of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Kobli1.jpg/220px-Kobli1.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Woman from Benin</p><p>Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young.

The Bantu-speaking peoples from The Sahel progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.[104] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (San or Bushmen) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also San, closely related to, but distinct from Hottentots) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.[105]</p><p>The peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger–Congo languages, belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the Songhai, Kanuri and Zarma, are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.</p><p>The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The Arabs who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the Arabic language and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo- European Greeks, Romans, and Vandals settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within Morocco and Algeria in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.[106] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.[citation needed]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bedscha.jpg/220px-Bedscha.jpg" width="220" height="196"><br><p>Beja bedouins from Northeast Africa</p><p>In the Horn of Africa, some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigrayans, collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic.</p><p>Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[107] Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa),[108] Kenya, Congo,[109] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[110] Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone.[111] Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa.[112] The country with the largest white African population is South Africa.[113] Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.[114]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>European colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[70] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[115]</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Main article: Languages of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg/170px-Africa_ethnic_groups_1996.jpg" width="170" height="196"><br><p>Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa:

Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa:</p><p>Following the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former Italian colonies in Africa. German is spoken in Namibia, as it was a former German protectorate.</p><h2>Culture</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg/220px-Bet_Giyorgis_church_Lalibela_01.jpg" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The rock-hewn Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Main article: Culture of Africa</p><p>Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.[118] Leopold II of Belgium attempted to civilize Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.[118]</p><p>Obidoh Freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern African art.[119] According to authors Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole, The precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art. [120] Fraser and Cole assert that, in Igboland, some art objects lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions.[120] Author Chika Okeke-Agulu states that the racist infrastructure of British imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign Africa and modernist art. [121] In Soweto, the West Rand Administrative Board established a Cultural Section to collect, read, and review scripts before performances could occur.[122] Editors F. Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe. [123] On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies. [124]</p><p>There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.</p><h3>Visual art and architecture</h3><p>African art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known beads were made from Nassarius shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.[125] The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world's tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, such as the Church of Saint George.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg/170px-Ke-Nako_Music-Performance_Vienna2008c.jpg" width="170" height="340"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A musician from South Africa</p><h3>Music and dance</h3><p>Main article: Music of Africa</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg/170px-Namibia_Rugby_Team.jpg" width="170" height="227"><br><p>The Namibia rugby team</p><p>Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonization.</p><h3>Sports</h3><p>Fifty-four African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup tournament, becoming the first African country to do so.</p><p>Cricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had One-Day International cricket (ODI) status (from 10 October 1997, until 30 January 2014). The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament.

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, 45% of the population are Christians, 40% are Muslims, and 10% follow traditional religions. A small number of Africans are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucianist, Baha'i, or Jewish.

				This article is about the group of islands. For the indigenous inhabitants of Caribbean region and people of Caribbean descent, see Caribbean people. For the body of water surrounding them, see Caribbean Sea. For other uses, see Caribbean (disambiguation).</p><p>The Caribbean (/?kær?'bi??n/ or /k?'r?bi?n/) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea[3] and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean[4]) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.</p><p>Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the region comprises more than 700 islands, islets, reefs and cays. (See the list.) These islands generally form island arcs that delineate the eastern and northern edges of the Caribbean Sea.[5] The Caribbean islands, consisting of the Greater Antilles on the north and the Lesser Antilles on the south and east (including the Leeward Antilles), are part of the somewhat larger West Indies grouping, which also includes the Lucayan Archipelago (comprising the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands) north of the Greater Antilles and Caribbean Sea. In a wider sense, the mainland countries of Belize, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana are often included due to their political and cultural ties with the region.[6]</p><p>Geopolitically, the Caribbean islands are usually regarded as a subregion of North America[7][8][9][10][11] and are organized into 30 territories including sovereign states, overseas departments, and dependencies. From December 15, 1954, to October 10, 2010, there was a country known as the Netherlands Antilles composed of five states, all of which were Dutch dependencies.[12] From January 3, 1958, to May 31, 1962, there was also a short-lived country called the Federation of the West Indies composed of ten English-speaking Caribbean territories, all of which were then British dependencies. The West Indies cricket team continues to represent many of those nations.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology and pronunciation[edit]</h2><p>The region takes its name from that of the Caribs, an ethnic group present in the Lesser Antilles and parts of adjacent South America at the time of the Spanish conquest of America.[13]</p><p>The two most prevalent pronunciations of Caribbean are KARR-?-BEE-?n, with the primary accent on the third syllable, and k?-RIB-ee-?n, with the accent on the second. The former pronunciation is the older of the two, although the stressed-second-syllable variant has been established for over 75 years.[14] It has been suggested that speakers of British English prefer KARR-?-BEE-?n while North American speakers more typically use k?-RIB-ee-?n,[15] although not all sources agree.[16] Usage is split within Caribbean English itself.[17]</p><h2>Definition[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png/300px-CIA_map_of_the_Caribbean.png" width="300" height="207"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Map of the Caribbean</p><p>The word Caribbean has multiple uses.

<div class="content"><p> Further information: Evolution of microeconomics</p><p>Microeconomics (from Greek prefix mikro- meaning small) is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these individuals and firms.[1][2][3]</p><p>One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the market mechanisms that establish relative prices among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes market failure, where markets fail to produce efficient results.</p><p>Microeconomics stands in contrast to macroeconomics, which involves the sum total of economic activity, dealing with the issues of growth, inflation, and unemployment and with national policies relating to these issues.[2] Microeconomics also deals with the effects of economic policies (such as changing taxation levels) on the aforementioned aspects of the economy.[4] Particularly in the wake of the Lucas critique, much of modern macroeconomic theory has been built upon 'microfoundations'—i.e. based upon basic assumptions about micro-level behavior.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Assumptions and definitions</h2><p>Microeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual. To economists, rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive. The technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function. Although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption, it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable.</p><p>Microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set. It is at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non-satiated. Without the assumption of LNS (local non-satiation) there is no guarantee that a rational individual would maximize utility. With the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem (UMP) is developed.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory. The utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences. The utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well. That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices but why individuals make choices as well.</p><p>The utility maximization problem is a constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. That is, since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed, a solution to the utility maximization problem exists. Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a Walrasian demand function or correspondence.</p><p>The utility maximization problem has so far been developed by taking consumer tastes (i.e. consumer utility) as the primitive. However, an alternative way to develop microeconomic theory is by taking consumer choice as the primitive. This model of microeconomic theory is referred to as Revealed preference theory.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg/220px-Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability at each price (supply) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand). The graph depicts a right-shift in demand from D1 to D2 along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new market-clearing equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).


		</p><p>
			The theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive. This implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services. In many real-life transactions, the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices. Quite often, a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand-supply equation of a good model. However, the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions.</p><p>Mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization. In fact, much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss. A classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good. In such cases, economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste, either directly by government control, indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare, or by creating missing markets to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed.</p><p>This is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory. Optimal welfare usually takes on a Paretian norm, which is a mathematical application of the Kaldor–Hicks method. This can diverge from the Utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people. Market failure in positive economics (microeconomics) is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory.</p><p>The demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility-maximizing process, with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set.</p><p>
		Microeconomic theories are involved with the choices that households and firms make. Some of these microeconomic concepts include elasticity of demand and supply, market structures and utility. Microeconomic looks into the way individuals and businesses behave in coming up with decisions to do with the distribution of rare resources and collaborations between these individuals and the firm. A production possibility frontier illustrates the maximum probable output combinations of two services or goods an economy may realise while all other resources are efficiently and wholly engaged. A production possibility frontier is used to explain the models of opportunity cost, illustrate the effects of economic development and demonstrate the theory of trade-offs.</p><p>Supply and demand is possibly amongst the most crucial conceptions of economics and it is the pillar of the economy of a market. Demand can be explained as the extent to which a service or a good is desired by users. The amount demanded is the sum of a commodity individuals are ready to purchase at a certain given price. Supply on the other hand refers to how much of a product a market can provide. The supplied quantity is the volume of a particular commodity manufacturers are willing to supply at a certain price. The relationship between demand and supply trigger the forces as a result of the sharing of resources. The law of demand states that when all other influences stay constant the higher the price of a good, the lesser the demand of the given produce. In other word the greater the price the lower the amount needed. The amount of a good bought by customers at a greater price is lower as the price rises the opportunity cost of buying a commodity. People will therefore naturally evade buying a commodity that will need them to sacrifice the use of something else that is more significant to them. Similar to the law of demand, the law of supply reveals the amounts that will be traded at a certain given price. Contrasting the law of demand, the supply relationship gives a rising slope. This means that the bigger the price the greater the quantity in supply. Manufacturers supply more at a high price because selling a quantity at a higher price rises income. Where demand and supply are the same, the economy is held to be at equilibrium. At the point of equilibrium the distribution of goods is at its most effectual because the amount of goods at supply is precisely the same as the volume of goods in demand. Therefore every individual is contented with prevailing state of the economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Elasticity is defined as the degree of receptiveness in demand and supply in relation to fluctuations in price. If a curve is more elastic then lesser alterations in price will result to a higher change in quantity used up. If a curve is less elastic it will then cause higher deviations in price to affect a change in amount consumed. Price elasticity of demand is the extent of responsiveness in quantity demanded in relation to price. Utility on the other hand is the amount of contentment resulting from the consumption of a commodity or services at a particular period. Utility is a psychological satisfaction not inherent. It is dependent on the persons own subjective approximate of satisfaction to be acquired from the consumption of a commodity. Utility is further divided into marginal utility, total utility and maximizing utility. Marginal utility refers to the extra utility resulting from the consumption of one extra unit of a commodity, the consumption of the rest of the goods remaining unaffected. Total utility is refers to as the number of units of utility that a consumer gains from consuming a given quantity of a good, service, or activity during a particular time period. The greater a consumers total utility, the larger the customer’s level of consumption. The cost to any firm of producing any output evidently depends upon the physical amounts of real resources. For instance material, labour and machine hours used in production. As the larger output needs a larger amount of resources, the total cost for larger output becomes high. Whereas the smaller output requires the smaller resources. The total cost for smaller output becomes smaller. A company can produce at lower cost when it produces better new techniques to products. Production with traditional and old method implicates high cost. The maximisation of returns includes the use of a definite technique to produce that can facilitate the optimal combination of factors. Production cost is defined as the expenditures by a business in producing a commodity. There are several kinds of cost concepts, these are marginal cost, total cost and average cost. Total is the cost of producing a certain output of the product in question. Total cost can be classified into variable cost and fixed cost. Fixed costs is also known as overhead cost. These are costs which do not differ with output. The costs will be the same whether the output is ten or twenty or a thousand of a product. Fixed costs entails interest on bank loans, depreciation of machinery, insurance charges and rent of factory. Variable costs are also called prime cost. Variable costs differ with alterations in output. The greater the output, the bigger the variable costs. Average cost is the cost of each unit of output and is achieved by dividing the total cost by the level of output. It is further divided into two parts, average fixed cost and average variable cost. Marginal cost is defined as the extra cost incurred by increasing output by one unit. It is the added cost of producing an additional unit of output. Perfect competition is a market structure in which the following characteristics are met. All businesses trade the same commodity, all firms will have a comparatively small market share, all firms are price takers meaning they cannot control the market price of their goods, the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit, and buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm. Perfect competition is a hypothetical market structure. Under perfect competition there are numerous buyers and sellers and prices reveal supply and demand. Customers will have several substitutes when the commodity they wish to buy quality begins to reduce or if it becomes more expensive. News firms can as well simply enter the market, leading to an extra competition. Monopoly on the other hand is where there is only one supplier in the market. For the reasons of regulation, monopoly power occurs where a single business owns 25% or more of a particular market. Monopolies can form for a number of reasons. For example, government can grant a business monopoly powers, if a firm has exclusive ownership of a limited resource, producers may have patents over designs for instance, giving them rights to trade a good or a service and a merger of two or more firms would create a monopoly. Monopolies have basic characteristics such as, they can maintain super normal returns in the long run, a monopolist with no substitute would be able to develop the greatest monopoly power and with no close substitutes, the monopolist can therefore derive supernormal profits.</p><p>In conclusion, microeconomics tries in any way not to explain what ought to happen in a market. Instead it will explains what to anticipate if some conditions are altered. For instance if producers increase the price of a commodity, customers will opt to purchase fewer of a product than before.</p><h2>Topics</h2><p>The study of microeconomics involves several key areas:</p><h3>Demand, supply, and equilibrium</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Main article: Supply and demand</p><p>Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market. It concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.</p><h3>Measurement of elasticities</h3><p> Main article: Elasticity (economics)</p><p>Elasticity is the measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another variable. Elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable, when the later variable has a causal influence on the former. It is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable, or of the function that determines it, to changes in causative variables in unitless ways. Frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.</p><h3>Consumer demand theory</h3><p> Main article: Consumer choice</p><p>Consumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves. The link between personal preferences, consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics. It is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints.</p><h3>Theory of production</h3><p> Main article: Production theory</p><p>Production theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs. Production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use, gift-giving in a gift economy, or exchange in a market economy. This can include manufacturing, storing, shipping, and packaging. Some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption. They see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production.</p><h3>Costs of production</h3><p> Main article: Cost-of-production theory of value</p><p>The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production: labour, capital, land. Technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital (ex:plant) or circulating capital (ex:intermediate goods).</p><h3>Perfect competition</h3><p> Main article: Perfect competition</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Perfect competition describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as eBay, on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers.</p><p>Benefits of Perfect Competition- All the knowledge such as price and information pertaining goods is equally dispersed among all buyers and sellers. As there are no barriers to enter into the market, monopoly does not usually occur. As all goods and products are same, advertisement is not required and it helps save the advertisement cost.in perfect competition products are identical</p><h3>Monopoly</h3><p> Main article: monopoly</p><p>A monopoly (from Greek monos µ???? (alone or single) + polein p??e?? (to sell)) exists when a single company is the only supplier of a particular commodity.</p><p>Benefits of Monopoly Market- Prices in monopoly market are stable as there is only one firm and so there is no competition. Due to the absence of competition there are high profits and leads to high number of sales monopoly firms tend to receive super profits from their operations.</p><h3>Oligopoly</h3><p> Main article: Oligopoly</p><p>An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output.[5]</p><p>Benefits of oligopoly market-As there is less competition in the firm, it tends to have massive profit.It is also able to easily compare prices forces these companies to keep their prices in competition with the other companies involved in the market.Each company scrambles to come out with latest and greatest thing in order to sway consumers to go with their company over a different one.</p><h3>Market structure</h3><p>The market structure can have several types of interacting market systems. Different forms of markets are a feature of capitalism and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system.</p><p>Examples of markets include but are not limited to: commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, stock markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market.</p><h3>Game theory</h3><p> Main article: Game theory</p><p>Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. The term game here implies the study of any strategic interaction between people. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers &amp; acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design,and voting systems, and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Labour economics</h3><p> Main article: Labour economics</p><p>Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers), the demands of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, labour is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.</p><h3>Welfare economics</h3><p> Main article: Welfare economics</p><p>Welfare economics is a branch of economics that uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate well-being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium.[7] It analyzes social welfare, however measured, in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Accordingly, individuals, with associated economic activities, are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare, whether of a group, a community, or a society, and there is no social welfare apart from the welfare associated with its individual units.</p><h3>Economics of information</h3><p> Main article: Information economics</p><p>Information economics or the economics of information is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions. Information has special characteristics. It is easy to create but hard to trust. It is easy to spread but hard to control. It influences many decisions. These special characteristics (as compared with other types of goods) complicate many standard economic theories.[8]</p><h2>Opportunity cost</h2><p> Main article: Opportunity cost</p><p>Opportunity cost of an activity (or goods) is equal to the best next alternative uses/forgone. Although opportunity cost can be hard to quantify, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real on the individual level. In fact, this principle applies to all decisions, not just economic ones.</p><p>Opportunity cost is one way to measure the cost of something. Rather than merely identifying and adding the costs of a project, one may also identify the next best alternative way to spend the same amount of money. The forgone profit of this next best alternative is the opportunity cost of the original choice. A common example is a farmer that chooses to farm their land rather than rent it to neighbors, wherein the opportunity cost is the forgone profit from renting. In this case, the farmer may expect to generate more profit alone. This kind of reasoning is a very important part of the calculation of discount rates in discounted cash flow investment valuation methodologies. Similarly, the opportunity cost of attending university is the lost wages a student could have earned in the workforce, rather than the cost of tuition, books, and other requisite items (whose sum makes up the total cost of attendance).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives, but rather the benefit of the single, best alternative. Possible opportunity costs of a city's decision to build a hospital on its vacant land are the loss of the land for a sporting center, or the inability to use the land for a parking lot, or the money that could have been made from selling the land, or the loss of any of the various other possible uses — but not all of these in aggregate. The true opportunity cost would be the forgone profit of the most lucrative of those listed.</p><p>One question that arises here is how to determine a money value for each alternative to facilitate comparison and assess opportunity cost, which may be more or less difficult depending on the things we are trying to compare. For example, many decisions involve environmental impacts whose monetary value is difficult to assess because of scientific uncertainty. Valuing a human life or the economic impact of an Arctic oil spill involves making subjective choices with ethical implications.</p><p>It is imperative to understand that no decision on allocating time is free. No matter what one chooses to do, they are always giving something up in return. An example of opportunity cost is deciding between going to a concert and doing homework. If one decides to go the concert, then they are giving up valuable time to study, but if they choose to do homework then the cost is giving up the concert. Any decision in allocating capital is likewise: there is an opportunity cost of capital, or a hurdle rate, defined as the expected rate one could get by investing in similar projects on the open market. Opportunity cost is vital in understanding microeconomics and decisions that are made.</p><h2>Applied</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg/220px-United_States_Capitol_Building.jpg" width="220" height="146"><p>

			Applied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study, many of which draw on methods from other fields. Industrial organization examines topics such as the entry and exit of firms, innovation, and the role of trademarks. Labor economics examines wages, employment, and labor market dynamics. Financial economics examines topics such as the structure of optimal portfolios, the rate of return to capital, econometric analysis of security returns, and corporate financial behavior. Public economics examines the design of government tax and expenditure policies and economic effects of these policies (e.g., social insurance programs). Political economy examines the role of political institutions in determining policy outcomes. Health economics examines the organization of health care systems, including the role of the health care workforce and health insurance programs. Education economics examines the organization of education provision and its implication for efficiency and equity, including the effects of education on productivity. Urban economics, which examines the challenges faced by cities, such as sprawl, air and water pollution, traffic congestion, and poverty, draws on the fields of urban geography and sociology. Law and economics applies microeconomic principles to the selection and enforcement of competing legal regimes and their relative efficiencies. Economic history examines the evolution of the economy and economic institutions, using methods and techniques from the fields of economics, history, geography, sociology, psychology, and political science.</p><p>&lt;ref&gt;==References==</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microeconomics&amp;oldid=783350389"

For rational choice theory as applied to criminology, see Rational choice theory (criminology).</p><p>Rational choice theory, also known as choice theory or rational action theory, is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behavior.[1] The basic premise of rational choice theory is that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions. The theory also focuses on the determinants of the individual choices (methodological individualism).</p><p>Rational choice theory then assumes that an individual has preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is preferred over option B and option B is preferred over option C, then A is preferred over C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.</p><p>Rationality is widely used as an assumption of the behavior of individuals in microeconomic models and analyses and appears in almost all economics textbook treatments of human decision-making. It is also used in political science,[2] sociology,[3] and philosophy. A particular version of rationality is instrumental rationality, which involves seeking the most cost-effective means to achieve a specific goal without reflecting on the worthiness of that goal. Gary Becker was an early proponent of applying rational actor models more widely.[4] Becker won the 1992 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his studies of discrimination, crime, and human capital.[5]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definition and scope</h2><p>The concept of rationality used in rational choice theory is different from the colloquial and most philosophical use of the word. Colloquially, rational behaviour typically means sensible, predictable, or in a thoughtful, clear-headed manner. Rational choice theory uses a narrower definition of rationality. At its most basic level, behavior is rational if it is goal-oriented, reflective (evaluative), and consistent (across time and different choice situations). This contrasts with behavior that is random, impulsive, conditioned, or adopted by (unevaluative) imitation.[citation needed]</p><p>Early neoclassical economists writing about rational choice, including William Stanley Jevons, assumed that agents make consumption choices so as to maximize their happiness, or utility. Contemporary theory bases rational choice on a set of choice axioms that need to be satisfied, and typically does not specify where the goal (preferences, desires) comes from. It mandates just a consistent ranking of the alternatives.[6]:501 Individuals choose the best action according to their personal preferences and the constraints facing them. E.g., there is nothing irrational in preferring fish to meat the first time, but there is something irrational in preferring fish to meat in one instant and preferring meat to fish in another, without anything else having changed.</p><p>Rational choice theorists do not claim that the theory describes the choice process, but rather that it predicts the outcome and pattern of choices. An assumption often added to the rational choice paradigm is that individual preferences are self-interested, in which case the individual can be referred to as a homo economicus. Such an individual acts as if balancing costs against benefits to arrive at action that maximizes personal advantage.[7] Proponents of such models, particularly those associated with the Chicago school of economics, do not claim that a model's assumptions are an accurate description of reality, only that they help formulate clear and falsifiable hypotheses.[citation needed] In this view, the only way to judge the success of a hypothesis is empirical tests.[7] To use an example from Milton Friedman, if a theory that says that the behavior of the leaves of a tree is explained by their rationality passes the empirical test, it is seen as successful.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg" width="150" height="179"><p>Without specifying the individual's goal or preferences it may not be possible to empirically test, or falsify, the rationality assumption. However, the predictions made by a specific version of the theory are testable. In recent years, the most prevalent version of rational choice theory, expected utility theory, has been challenged by the experimental results of behavioral economics. Economists are learning from other fields, such as psychology, and are enriching their theories of choice in order to get a more accurate view of human decision-making. For example, the behavioral economist and experimental psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for his work in this field.</p><p>Rational choice theory has become increasingly employed in social sciences other than economics, such as sociology, evolutionary theory and political science in recent decades.[8][9] It has had far-reaching impacts on the study of political science, especially in fields like the study of interest groups, elections, behaviour in legislatures, coalitions, and bureaucracy.[10] In these fields, the use of the rational choice paradigm to explain broad social phenomena is the subject of active controversy.[11][12]</p><h2>Actions, assumptions, and individual preferences</h2><p>The premise of rational choice theory as a social science methodology is that the aggregate behavior in society reflects the sum of the choices made by individuals. Each individual, in turn, makes their choice based on their own preferences and the constraints (or choice set) they face.</p><p>At the individual level, rational choice theory stipulates that the agent chooses the action (or outcome) they most prefer. In the case where actions (or outcomes) can be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, a rational individual chooses the action (or outcome) that provides the maximum net benefit, i.e., the maximum benefit minus cost.</p><p>The theory applies to more general settings than those identified by costs and benefit. In general, rational decision making entails choosing among all available alternatives the alternative that the individual most prefers. The alternatives can be a set of actions (what to do?) or a set of objects (what to choose/buy). In the case of actions, what the individual really cares about are the outcomes that results from each possible action. Actions, in this case, are only an instrument for obtaining a particular outcome.</p><h3>Formal statement</h3><p>The available alternatives are often expressed as a set of objects, for example a set of j exhaustive and exclusive actions:</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rational_choice_theory&amp;oldid=770556981"

Many normative (value) judgments, however, are held conditionally, to be given up if facts or knowledge of facts changes, so that a change of values may be purely scientific.[2] On the other hand, welfare economist Amartya Sen distinguishes basic (normative) judgments, which do not depend on such knowledge, from nonbasic judgments, which do. He finds it interesting to note that no judgments are demonstrably basic while some value judgments may be shown to be nonbasic. This leaves open the possibility of fruitful scientific discussion of value judgments.[3]</p><p>Positive and normative economics are often synthesized in the style of practical idealism. In this discipline, sometimes called the art of economics, positive economics is utilized as a practical tool for achieving normative objectives.</p><p>An example of a normative economic statement is as follows:</p><p>This is a normative statement, because it reflects value judgments. This specific statement makes the judgment that farmers need a higher living standard and that family farms need to be saved.[1]</p><p>Subfields of normative economics include social choice theory, cooperative game theory, and mechanism design.</p><p>Some earlier technical problems posed in welfare economics and the theory of justice have been sufficiently addressed as to leave room for consideration of proposals in applied fields such as resource allocation, public policy, social indicators, and inequality and poverty measurement.[4]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Normative_economics&amp;oldid=782036831"

					</p><br><h1 lang="en">Business economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Business economics is a field in applied economics which uses economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze business enterprises and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, capital and product markets.[1] A professional focus of the journal Business Economics has been expressed as providing practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Subject matter</h2><p>Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why corporate firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.[1]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Ambiguity in the use of term</h2><p>The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/industrial organisation, managerial economics, and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly. One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with industry but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.[3] Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.[4]</p><h2>Interpretations from various universities</h2><p>Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.[5] The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at University of Delhi is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.[6]</p><p>The program at Harvard University uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including business administration, management, and related fields of business economics.[7]</p><p>The University of Miami defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.[8]</p><p>Courses at the University of Manchester interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural theory of the firm; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the structure, conduct and performance of business at the industry level.[9]</p><p>Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of Gino Zappa, for example a standard course[10] at the Politecnico di Milano involves studying corporate governance, accounting, investment analysis, budgeting and business strategy.</p><p>La Trobe University of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.</p><h2>Notes</h2><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_economics&amp;oldid=771210217"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Mainstream economics</h1><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Mainstream economics is the body of knowledge, theories, and models of economics, as taught across prominent universities, that are widely accepted by scholars in the field. It can be contrasted to heterodox economics, which are various schools or approaches that are only accepted by their expositors, with little influence on the majority of academic economists. Mainstream economics has been associated with neoclassical economics[1] and with the neoclassical synthesis, which combines neoclassical methods and a Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>United States</h2><p>In the United States, mainstream economists are not generally separated into schools, but two major contemporary economic schools of thought have been the saltwater and freshwater schools. In the early 1970s, so-called fresh-water economists challenged the prevailing consensus in macroeconomics research. Key elements of their approach were that macroeconomics had to be dynamic, quantitative, and based on how individuals and institutions make decisions under uncertainty. Many of the proponents of this radically new approach to macroeconomics were associated with Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester and the University of Minnesota. They were referred to as the freshwater school since Pittsburgh, Chicago, Rochester, and Minneapolis are located nearer to the Great Lakes. The established consensus was primarily defended by economists at the universities and other institutions located near the east and west coast of the United States, such as Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Columbia, Stanford, and Yale. They were therefore often referred to as the saltwater schools. Today, mainstream economists do not, in general, identify themselves as members of a particular school.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Economics has always featured multiple schools of economic thought, with different schools having different prominence across countries and over time. The current use of the term mainstream economics is specific to the post–World War II era, particularly in the English-speaking world, and to a lesser extent globally.</p><p>Prior to the development of modern academic economics, the dominant school in Europe was mercantilism, which was rather a loose set of related ideas than an institutionalized school. With the development of modern economics, conventionally given as the late 18th-century The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, British economics developed and became dominated by what is now called the classical school. From The Wealth of Nations until the Great Depression, the dominant school within the English-speaking world was classical economics, and its successor, neoclassical economics.[3] In continental Europe, the earlier work of the physiocrats in France formed a distinct tradition, as did the later work of the historical school of economics in Germany, and throughout the 19th century there were debates in British economics, notably the opposition underconsumptionist school.</p><p>During the Great Depression and the following Second World War, the school of Keynesian economics gained prominence, which built on the work of the underconsumptionist school, and present-day mainstream economics stems from the neoclassical synthesis, which was the post–World War II merger of Keynesian macroeconomics and neoclassical microeconomics.</p><p>In continental Europe, by contrast, Keynesian economics was rejected, with German thought dominated by the Freiburg school, whose political philosophy of ordoliberalism formed the intellectual basis of Germany's post-war social market economy. Within developing economies, which formed the majority of the world's population, various schools of development economics have been influential.</p><p>Since 2007, the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the ensuing global economic crisis has publicly exposed divisions within mainstream economics and significantly intensified controversy about its status, with some arguing for radical overhaul or rejection of mainstream economics, others arguing for evolutionary change, and others still arguing that mainstream economics explains the crisis.[4]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Term</h3><p>The term mainstream economics came into common use in the late 20th century. It appears in 2001 edition of the seminal textbook Economics by Samuelson and Nordhaus[5] on the inside back cover in the Family Tree of Economics, which depicts arrows into Modern Mainstream Economics from J.M. Keynes (1936) and neoclassical economics (1860–1910). The term neoclassical synthesis itself also first appears in the 1955 edition of Samuelson's textbook.[6]</p><h2>Scope</h2><p>Mainstream economics can be defined, as distinct from other schools of economics, by various criteria, notably by its assumptions, its methods, and its topics.</p><h3>Assumptions</h3><p>A number of assumptions may underpin many mainstream economic models, while being rejected by some heterodox schools. These include the neoclassical assumptions of rational choice theory, a representative agent, and, often, rational expectations. Much of modern economic modelling consists of exploring the effects that complicating factors have on models, such as imperfect and asymmetric information, incomplete markets, imperfect competition and transaction costs.</p><p>The starting point of orthodox economic analysis is the individual. People are generally defined as units with a common goal: maximisation through rational behaviour. The only differences consist of:</p><p>From this theoretical framework, orthodox economists derive that political action should not be used to solve the problems of the economic system. Instead, the solution ought to derive from an intervention on the above-mentioned maximisation objectives and constraints. It is in this context that economic capitalism finds its justification. Capitalism and its arguments seem logical because orthodox economics theories think of the aggregate economy as the sum of the agents trying to maximise their utility or profit through exchange.[7]</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Mainstream economics has also been defined methodologically as work which mainstream economists are willing to engage, which requires conforming to the mainstream language of mathematical models,[8] featuring calculus, optimization, and comparative statics. Under this definition, areas of thought which are typically thought of as heterodox because they do not work under the typical neoclassical assumptions, such as econophysics, behavioral economics, and evolutionary economics, can be considered mainstream when they are engaged in the mainstream, using mainstream methods.[8] Geoffrey Hodgson has considered the possibility that evolutionary economics and institutional economics may eventually become a new mainstream.[9]</p><p>Additionally, some economic fields include elements of both mainstream economics and heterodox economics: for example, the Austrian economics[how?],[10] institutional economics, neuroeconomics and non-linear complexity theory.[11] They may use neoclassical economics as a point of departure. At least one institutionalist has argued that neoclassical economics no longer dominates a mainstream economics.[12]</p><p>A countervailing trend is the expansion of mainstream methods to such seemingly distant fields as crime, the family, law, politics, and religion. The latter phenomenon is sometimes referred to as economic imperialism.[13]</p><h3>Topics</h3><p>Mainstream economics includes theories of market and government failure and private and public goods. These developments suggest a range of views on the desirability or otherwise of government intervention.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>Since the financial crisis of 2007–2010, considerable conflict has arisen, among both economic theorists and a wider cross-section of the public, regarding the status and future of mainstream economics.[4][14] Some critics have argued that potentially promising approaches have been excluded in major mainstream publications by a focus on problems amenable to formal modeling.[15][16]</p><p>Chartalists, who are generally considered part of the Post-Keynesian school of thought, criticise mainstream theory as failing to describe the actual mechanics of modern fiat monetary economies. Chartalism focuses on a detailed understanding of the way money actually flows through the different sectors of an economy. Specifically, Chartalism focuses on the interaction between central banks, treasury and the private banking system. Chartalism rejects critical mainstream theories such as the loanable funds market, the money multiplier, and the utility of fiscal austerity.</p><p>Some economists, in the vein of ecological economics, believe that the neoclassical holy trinity of rationality, greed, and equilibrium, is being replaced by the holy trinity of purposeful behavior, enlightened self-interest, and sustainability, considerably broadening the scope of what is mainstream.[8] Ecological economics addresses sustainability issues, such as public goods, natural capital and negative externalities (such as pollution).[17]</p><p>Energy related theories of economic concepts also exist within energy economics relating to thermodynamic concepts of economic thinking, such as energy accounting.[18] Biophysical economics relates to this area.[19]</p><h3>Survey articles</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mainstream_economics&amp;oldid=783714535"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Green economy</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>The green economy is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with ecological economics, but has a more politically applied focus.[1][2] The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report argues that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive. [3]</p><p>A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital) and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.[4]</p><p>Green Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Green economists and economics</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after Lynn Margulis). A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism, postmodernism, the ecology movement, peace movement, Green politics, green anarchism and anti-globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to some equally ill-defined mainstream economics.[citation needed]</p><p>The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capital-G Green term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of 'green economists' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. (see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson's presentation of these.)[citation needed]</p><p>Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance, it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as canals). Or, it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat, an exploited base of non-human workers providing surplus value to the human economy, or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.[citation needed]</p><p>An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of green economics. As of 2010 the Bretton Woods institutions (notably the World Bank[5] and International Monetary Fund (via its Green Fund initiative) responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance.[citation needed] Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives.[citation needed] The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that [b]ased on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation.

The German Renewable Energy Act, legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, all provide such market incentives.[citation needed] However, other experts[13] argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature, arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years.[14] Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, Towards a Green Economy,[15] while well-intentioned ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations.[16] Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and green growth in particular, based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change and may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U-turn of global greenhouse gas emissions.[17] Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,[18] and argued that the Green Economy, as advocated by the UN, is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis.[19] He has also criticised the UN's project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity (TEEB),[20] and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Notes and references</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_economy&amp;oldid=781971723"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><p>Michael Grossman's 1972 model of health production[8] has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable. Grossman's model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health. Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of investments in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of capital. The model acknowledges that health is both a consumption good that yields direct satisfaction and utility, and an investment good, which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman's 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.</p><p>In Grossman's model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the marginal cost of health capital is equal to the marginal benefit. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate d. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: 
		  
			
			  
				M
				
				  C
				  
					H
					K
				  
				
				=
				r
				+
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle MC_{HK}=r+\delta \,}
		  
		. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, 
		  
			
			  
				d
				
			  
			
			{\displaystyle \delta \,}
		  
		 increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock. The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.</p><p>Beyond issues of the fundamental, real demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the marginal benefit of medical care (which is always associated with this real demand curve based on derived demand), and a separate effective demand curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices. Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price. The consumer sets MB=MC out of pocket, and so the effective demand will have a separate relationship between price and quantity than will the marginal benefit curve or real demand relationship. This distinction is often described under the rubric of ex-post moral hazard (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).</p><h2>Health technology assessment</h2><p>Economic evaluation, and in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen – IQWiG) in Germany and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.</p><p>Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of cost–utility analysis (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the Quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</p><h2>Healthcare markets</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The five health markets typically analyzed are:</p><p>Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created risk pools in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with adverse selection which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection (cherry-picking), and preexisting condition exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.</p><p>Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting moral hazard drives up costs, as shown by the famous RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.</p><p>Consumers in healthcare markets often suffer from a lack of adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with supplier induced demand, whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial practice variations, whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.</p><p>Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.[9]</p><h2>Other issues</h2><h3>Medical economics</h3><p>Often used synonymously with health economics, medical economics, according to Culyer,[10] is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses mathematical models to synthesise data from biostatistics and epidemiology for support of medical decision-making, both for individuals and for wider health policy.</p><h3>Behavioral economics</h3><p>Peter Orszag has suggested that behavioral economics is an important factor for improving the healthcare system, but that relatively little progress has been made when compared to retirement policy.[11]</p><h3>Mental health economics</h3><p>Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from pharmacoeconomics to labor economics and welfare economics. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children.[12] Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home.[13] In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.[14]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual's potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture presenteeism, when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.[13]</p><p>Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral.[15] Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of knowledge brokers.[13]</p><h2>Journals</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_economics&amp;oldid=783361465"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Public choice</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Public choice or public choice theory refers to the use of economic tools to deal with traditional problems of political science.[1] Its content includes the study of political behavior. In political science, it is the subset of positive political theory that studies self-interested agents (voters, politicians, bureaucrats) and their interactions, which can be represented in a number of ways – using (for example) standard constrained utility maximization, game theory, or decision theory.[1] Public-choice analysis has roots in positive analysis (what is) but is often used for normative purposes (what ought to be) in order to identify a problem or to suggest improvements to constitutional rules (i.e., constitutional economics).[1][2][3]</p><p>The Journal of Economic Literature's classification code regards public choice as a subarea of microeconomics, under JEL: D7: Analysis of Collective Decision-Making (specifically, JEL: D72: Economic Models of Political Processes: Rent-Seeking, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior).[4] Public choice theory is also closely related to social-choice theory, a mathematical approach to aggregation of individual interests, welfares, or votes.[5] Much early work had aspects of both, and both fields use the tools of economics and game theory. Since voter behavior influences the behavior of public officials, public-choice theory often uses results from social-choice theory. General treatments of public choice may also be classified under public economics.[6]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background and development</h2><p>A precursor of modern public choice theory was the work of Knut Wicksell (1896),[7] which treated government as political exchange, a quid pro quo, in formulating a benefit principle linking taxes and expenditures.[8]</p><p>Some subsequent economic analysis has been described as treating government as though it attempted to maximize some kind sort of welfare function for society and as distinct from characterizations of economic agents, such as those in business.[1] In contrast, public choice theory modeled government as made up of officials who, besides pursuing the public interest, might act to benefit themselves, for example in the budget-maximizing model of bureaucracy, possibly at the cost of efficiency.[1][9]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Modern public-choice theory has been dated from the work of Duncan Black, sometimes called the founding father of public choice.[10] In a series of papers from 1948, which culminated in The Theory of Committees and Elections (1958),[11] and later, Black outlined a program of unification toward a more general Theory of Economic and Political Choices based on common formal methods,[12] developed underlying concepts of what would become median voter theory, and rediscovered earlier works on voting theory.[13][1][14]</p><p>Kenneth J. Arrow's Social Choice and Individual Values (1951) influenced formulation of the theory. Among other important works are Anthony Downs (1957) An Economic Theory of Democracy and Mancur Olson (1965) The Logic of Collective Action.[15]</p><p>James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock coauthored The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy (1962), considered one of the landmarks in public choice. In particular, the preface describes the book as about the political organization of a free society. But its methodology, conceptual apparatus, and analytics are derived, essentially, from the discipline that has as its subject the economic organization of such a society (1962, p. v). The book focuses on positive-economic analysis as to the development of constitutional democracy but in an ethical context of consent. The consent takes the form of a compensation principle like Pareto efficiency for making a policy change and unanimity or at least no opposition as a point of departure for social choice.</p><p>Somewhat later, the probabilistic voting theory started to displace the median voter theory in showing how to find Nash equilibria in multidimensional space. The theory was later formalized further by Peter Coughlin.[16]</p><h2>Decision-making processes and the state</h2><p>One way to organize the subject matter studied by public choice theorists is to begin with the foundations of the state itself. According to this procedure, the most fundamental subject is the origin of government. Although some work has been done on anarchy, autocracy, revolution, and even war, the bulk of the study in this area has concerned the fundamental problem of collectively choosing constitutional rules. This work assumes a group of individuals who aim to form a government, then it focuses on the problem of hiring the agents required to carry out government functions agreed upon by the members.[citation needed]</p><h2>Expressive interests and democratic irrationality</h2><p>Geoffrey Brennan and Loren Lomasky claim that democratic policy is biased to favor expressive interests and neglect practical and utilitarian considerations. Brennan and Lomasky differentiate between instrumental interests (any kind of practical benefit, both monetary and non-monetary) and expressive interests (forms of expression like applause). According to Brennan and Lomasky, the voting paradox can be resolved by differentiating between expressive and instrumental interests.</p><p>This argument has led some public choice scholars to claim that politics is plagued by irrationality. In articles published in the Econ Journal Watch, economist Bryan Caplan contended that voter choices and government economic decisions are inherently irrational.[17][18] Caplan's ideas are more fully developed in his book The Myth of the Rational Voter (Princeton University Press 2007). Countering Donald Wittman's arguments in The Myth of Democratic Failure, Caplan claims that politics is biased in favor of irrational beliefs.</p><p>According to Caplan, democracy effectively subsidizes irrational beliefs. Anyone who derives utility from potentially irrational policies like protectionism can receive private benefits while imposing the costs of such beliefs on the general public. Were people to bear the full costs of their irrational beliefs, they would lobby for them optimally, taking into account both their instrumental consequences and their expressive appeal. Instead, democracy oversupplies policies based on irrational beliefs. Caplan defines rationality mainly in terms of mainstream price theory, pointing out that mainstream economists tend to oppose protectionism and government regulation more than the general population, and that more educated people are closer to economists on this score, even after controlling for confounding factors such as income, wealth or political affiliation. One criticism is that many economists do not share Caplan's views on the nature of public choice. However, Caplan does have data to support his position. Economists have, in fact, often been frustrated by public opposition to economic reasoning. As Sam Peltzman puts it:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Economists know what steps would improve the efficiency of HSE [health, safety, and environmental] regulation, and they have not been bashful advocates of them. These steps include substituting markets in property rights, such as emission rights, for command and control...The real problem lies deeper than any lack of reform proposals or failure to press them. It is our inability to understand their lack of political appeal.[19]</p><p>Public choice's application to government regulation was developed by George Stigler (1971) and Sam Peltzman (1976).</p><h2>Special interests</h2><p>Public choice theory is often used to explain how political decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many advocacy group and pork barrel projects are not the desire of the overall democracy. However, it makes sense for politicians to support these projects. It may make them feel powerful and important. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as lobbyists. The project may be of interest to the politician's local constituency, increasing district votes or campaign contributions. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally. They can gain government favors worth millions or billions for relatively small investments. They face a risk of losing out to their competitors if they don't seek these favors. The taxpayer is also behaving rationally. The cost of defeating any one government give-away is very high, while the benefits to the individual taxpayer are very small. Each citizen pays only a few pennies or a few dollars for any given government favor, while the costs of ending that favor would be many times higher. Everyone involved has rational incentives to do exactly what they are doing, even though the desire of the general constituency is opposite. Costs are diffused, while benefits are concentrated. The voices of vocal minorities with much to gain are heard over those of indifferent majorities with little to individually lose.[20][21] However the notion that groups with concentrated interests will dominate politics is incomplete because it is only one half of political equilibrium. Something must incite those preyed upon to resist even the best organized concentrated interests. In his article on interest groups Gary Becker identified this countervailing force as being the deadweight loss from predation. His views capped what has come to be known as the Chicago school of political economy and it has come in sharp conflict with the so-called Virginia faction of public choice due to its assertion that politics will tend towards efficiency due to nonlinear deadweight losses and due to its claim that political efficiency renders policy advice irrelevant.[22]</p><p>While good government tends to be a pure public good for the mass of voters, there may be many advocacy groups that have strong incentives for lobbying the government to implement specific policies that would benefit them, potentially at the expense of the general public. For example, lobbying by the sugar manufacturers might result in an inefficient subsidy for the production of sugar, either direct or by protectionist measures. The costs of such inefficient policies are dispersed over all citizens, and therefore unnoticeable to each individual. On the other hand, the benefits are shared by a small special-interest group with a strong incentive to perpetuate the policy by further lobbying. Due to rational ignorance, the vast majority of voters will be unaware of the effort; in fact, although voters may be aware of special-interest lobbying efforts, this may merely select for policies which are even harder to evaluate by the general public, rather than improving their overall efficiency. Even if the public were able to evaluate policy proposals effectively, they would find it infeasible to engage in collective action in order to defend their diffuse interest. Therefore, theorists expect that numerous special interests will be able to successfully lobby for various inefficient policies. In public choice theory, such scenarios of inefficient government policies are referred to as government failure – a term akin to market failure from earlier theoretical welfare economics.[20]</p><h2>Rent-seeking</h2><p>A field that is closely related to public choice is rent-seeking. This field combines the study of a market economy with that of government. Thus, one might regard it as a new political economy. Its basic thesis is that when both a market economy and government are present, government agents provide numerous special market privileges. Both the government agents and self-interested market participants seek these privileges in order to partake in the resulting monopoly rent. Rentiers gain benefits above what the market would have offered, but in the process allocate resources in sub-optimal fashion from a societal point of view.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Rent-seeking is broader than public choice in that it applies to autocracies as well as democracies and, therefore, is not directly concerned with collective decision making. However, the obvious pressures it exerts on legislators, executives, bureaucrats, and even judges are factors that public choice theory must account for in its analysis of collective decision-making rules and institutions. Moreover, the members of a collective who are planning a government would be wise to take prospective rent-seeking into account.[21]</p><p>Another major claim is that much of political activity is a form of rent-seeking which wastes resources. Gordon Tullock, Jagdish Bhagwati, and Anne Osborn Krueger have argued that rent-seeking has caused considerable waste.[21] In a parallel line of research Fred McChesney claims that rent extraction causes considerable waste, especially in the developing world. As the term implies, rent extraction happens when officials use threats to extort payments from private parties.</p><h2>Bureaucracy</h2><p>Another major sub-field is the study of bureaucracy. The usual model depicts the top bureaucrats as being chosen by the chief executive and legislature, depending on whether the democratic system is presidential or parliamentary. The typical image of a bureau chief is a person on a fixed salary who is concerned with pleasing those who appointed him. The latter have the power to hire and fire him more or less at will. The bulk of the bureaucrats, however, are civil servants whose jobs and pay are protected by a civil service system against major changes by their appointed bureau chiefs. This image is often compared with that of a business owner whose profit varies with the success of production and sales, who aims to maximize profit, and who can in an ideal system hire and fire employees at will.[9] William Niskanen is generally considered the founder of public choice literature on the bureaucracy.[9]</p><h2>Political stance</h2><p>From such results it is sometimes asserted that public choice theory has an anti-state tilt. But there is ideological diversity among public choice theorists. Mancur Olson for example was an advocate of a strong state and instead opposed political interest group lobbying.[15] More generally, James Buchanan has suggested that public choice theory be interpreted as politics without romance, a critical approach to a pervasive earlier notion of idealized politics set against market failure.[23]</p><p>The British journalist, Alistair Cooke, commenting on the Nobel Prize awarded to James M. Buchanan in 1986, reportedly summarized the public choice view of politicians by saying, Public choice embodies the homely but important truth that politicians are, after all, no less selfish than the rest of us.[24]</p><h2>Recognition</h2><p>Several notable public choice scholars have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, including James M. Buchanan (1986), George Stigler (1982), Gary Becker (1992), Vernon Smith (2002) and Elinor Ostrom (2009). In addition, Vernon Smith and Elinor Ostrom were former presidents of the Public Choice Society.[25]</p><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>In their 1994 book Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory, political scientists Donald P. Green and Ian Shapiro argue that rational choice theory (of which public choice theory is a branch) has contributed less to the field than its popularity suggests.[26] They write:</p><p>Linda McQuaig writes in All You Can Eat:[citation needed]</p><p>Amartya Sen has acknowledged the contribution of Buchanan and Tullock's analysis of unanimity as a criterion for collective choice,[28] but argued for the logical inconsistency of the Pareto-principle version of unanimity with even minimal liberty in a social-choice framework.[29] More broadly he qualified its use when other information besides personal utility is given a weight in public judgments.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Buchanan and Tullock themselves outline methodological qualifications of the approach developed in their work The Calculus of Consent (1962), p. 30:</p><p>The reach of public choice theory might be even wider than Buchanan and Tullock indicate. Some theory shows that relaxing the assumption of self-interest leaves many public choice problems in place (although sometimes in altered from). As long as political actors are rational maximizers who disagree about the objectives government should pursue, public choice problems persist even if the disagreement stems from adherence to competing ethical principles rather than from competing self-interested wants.[31]</p><h3>New Ideas and Policy Innovation rather than Self Interest</h3><p>Another criticism suggests that some of the great developments in politics and policy have not been a product of individual actor's vested self interests, but rather because of new ideas. New ideas, by virtue of being innovative, expand the policy choices on the menu outside of simple vested interests and allow for equilibriums which were previously not possible. Dani Rodrik of the Harvard Kennedy School provides several examples of this phenomenon, where both Elites and Non-Elites were made better off through policy innovation, or in the case of the democratization of South Africa, making commitments to avoid Hold-up problems.[32]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_choice&amp;oldid=780790157"					
						Categories:  Hidden categories:</p><br><h1 lang="en">Institutional economics</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behaviour. Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen's instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the ceremonial sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 American Economic Review article by Walton H. Hamilton.[1][2]</p><p>Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics.[3]</p><p>A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the Legal Foundations of Capitalism by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there is heated debate on the role of law (formal institution) on economic growth.[4] Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior.</p><p>Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assume stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium). It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons.[5] Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically-bounded social system; other institutionalist economists[who?] disagree with Marx's definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals.</p><p>Traditional institutionalism rejects the reduction of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy).[6] Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world-views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley.)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The vacillations of institutions are necessarily a result of the very incentives created by such institutions, and are thus endogenous. Emphatically, traditional institutionalism is in many ways a response to the current economic orthodoxy; its reintroduction in the form of institutionalist political economy is thus an explicit challenge to neoclassical economics, since it is based on the fundamental premise that neoclassicists oppose: that economics cannot be separated from the political and social system within which it is embedded.</p><p>Some of the authors associated with this school include Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Mark Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Thorstein Veblen</h2><p> Main articles: Thorstein Veblen and The Theory of the Leisure Class</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Veblen3a.jpg/220px-Veblen3a.jpg" width="220" height="288"><p>


		Thorstein Veblen came from a Norwegian immigrant family in rural Mid-western America.


		</p><p>
			Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929) wrote his first and most influential book while he was at the University of Chicago, on The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899).[7] In it he analyzed the motivation in capitalism to conspicuously consume their riches as a way of demonstrating success. Conspicuous leisure was another focus of Veblen's critique. The concept of conspicuous consumption was in direct contradiction to the neoclassical view that capitalism was efficient.</p><p>In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904) Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of profiteering, did not advocate change.</p><p>Through the 1920s and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Thorstein Veblen's warnings of the tendency for wasteful consumption and the necessity of creating sound financial institutions seemed to ring true. Veblen remains a leading critic, which cautions against the excesses of the American way.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1898 an article entitled Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science[8] and he became the precursor of current evolutionary economics.</p><h2>John R. Commons</h2><p> Main article: John R. Commons</p><p>John R. Commons (1862–1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in Institutional Economics (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes.</p><p>Commons thought that government should be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.</p><h2>Wesley Mitchell</h2><p> Main article: Wesley Mitchell</p><p>Wesley Clair Mitchell (August 5, 1874 – October 29, 1948) was an American economist known for his empirical work on business cycles and for guiding the National Bureau of Economic Research in its first decades. Mitchell’s teachers included economists Thorstein Veblen and J. L. Laughlin and philosopher John Dewey.</p><h2>Clarence Ayres</h2><p> Main article: Clarence Edwin Ayres</p><p>Clarence Ayres (May 6, 1891 – July 24, 1972) was the principal thinker of what some has called the Texas school of institutional economics. Ayres developed on the ideas of Thorstein Veblen with a dichotomy of technology and institutions to separate the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structures. He claimed that technology was always one step ahead of the socio-cultural institutions.</p><p>It can be argued that Ayres was not an institutionalist in any normal sense of the term; since he identified institutions with sentiments and superstition and in consequence institutions only played a kind of residual role in this theory of development which core center was that of technology. Ayres was under strong influence of Hegel and institutions for Ayres had the same function as Schein (with the connotation of deception, and illusion) for Hegel. A more appropriate name for Ayres' position would be that of a techno-behaviorist rather than an institutionalist.</p><h2>Adolf Berle</h2><p> Main article: Adolf Berle</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg/220px-Adolf_Augustus_Berle_NYWTS.jpg" width="220" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr.


		</p><p id="lastLine">
			Adolf A. Berle (1895–1971) was one of the first authors to combine legal and economic analysis, and his work stands as a foundig pillar of thought in modern corporate governance. Like Keynes, Berle was at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but subsequently resigned from his diplomatic job dissatisfied with the Versailles Treaty terms. In his book with Gardiner C. Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account.</p><p>Directors of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered.</p><h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Delaware Valley</h1><p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

				This article is about the Philadelphia metropolitan area. For other uses, see Delaware Valley (disambiguation).</p><p>The Delaware Valley is the valley through which the Delaware River flows. By extension, this toponym is commonly used to refer to Greater Philadelphia or Philadelphia metropolitan area (the [Lower] Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area), which straddles the Lower Delaware River just north of its estuary. The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is located at the southern part of the Northeast megalopolis and as such, the Delaware Valley can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The Delaware Valley Metropolitan Area is composed of several counties in southeastern Pennsylvania and southwestern New Jersey, one county in northern Delaware and one county in northeastern Maryland. The MSA has a population of over 6 million, while the CSA has a population of over 7.1 million (as of the 2010 Census Bureau count). Philadelphia, being the region's major commercial, cultural, and industrial center, wields a rather large sphere of influence that affects the counties that immediately surround it.</p><p>Some of the Delaware Valley's most well-known contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education and medical institutions. The Delaware Valley has been influential upon American history and industry. The region are leaders in higher education, biotechnology, medicine, tourism and many others. With a gross domestic product of $388&nbsp;billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation.[3]</p><p>The area has hosted many people and sites significant to American culture and history, particularly in the arts, where Philadelphia alone has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city[4], politics, including many influential people involved in politics such as Benjamin Franklin and Joe Biden, and the American Revolution. Philadelphia is famously known as The Birthplace of America[5] as the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were both drafted and signed there. On December&nbsp;7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution, and has since promoted itself as The First State.[6]</p><p>The Delaware Valley was home many other instrumental moments in the American Revolution , including the First and Second Continental Congress, the preservation of the Liberty Bell, the Battles of Germantown, Brandywine, and Red Bank, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, the winter of 1777–78 at Valley Forge, the Philadelphia Convention, and many others. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today, the area is home to some of the most prestigious universities in the world, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, and Temple University.[7] The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is consistently ranked as the best business school in the world.[8]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>In geology and geography, a strict sense of the term would incorporate the Delaware River's main drainage basin, and so encompass major tributaries such as the Schuylkill River and Lehigh River and their valleys or sub-basins. These extensions also apply culturally with decreasing degree gradually decreased by proximal distance because the ease of land travel enables a great deal of daily interaction; for example, the large number of commuters who travel daily 45–90 minutes creates cultural blends and parallel values.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/DelawareRiverBasin-01.png/200px-DelawareRiverBasin-01.png" width="200" height="232"><br><p>The drainage basin of the Delaware River.</p><h2>Population and economy[edit]</h2><p>As of March 2011, the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD Metropolitan Statistical Area[9] constitutes the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States.[10][11][12] Its CSA ranks 8th.</p><p>Based on commuter flows, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also defines a wider labor market region that adds Berks County, Pennsylvania to the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, bringing the total metropolitan population to 6.53 million.</p><p>Philadelphia's media market ranks fourth, behind New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, in Nielsen Media Market size rankings. It also borders the New York metropolitan area located directly to the north of this area.</p><p>Such educational institutions as Delaware Valley Regional High School in Alexandria Township and Delaware Valley College in Doylestown Township are named after the region. Likewise, Frenchtown's now defunct newspaper The Delaware Valley News was another example of the usage.</p><h3>Counties making up the Delaware Valley[edit]</h3><p>See also: Metropolitan Statistical Areas of New Jersey

Within the Hispanic population, the vast majority are Puerto Ricans, though other groups include Dominicans and Mexicans.[17] There is a significant West Indian community. There is even a small Native American community known as Lenapehoking for Lenni-Lenape Indians of West Philadelphia.</p><p>Philadelphia's suburbs contain a high concentration of malls, the two largest of which have at least 5,000,000 square feet (460,000&nbsp;m2) of office space, and at least 600,000 square feet (56,000&nbsp;m2) of retail. These are the King of Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is the largest in the United States (leasable sq. feet of retail space), and the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which was the first enclosed mall on the East Coast. Malls, office complexes, strip shopping plazas, expressways, and tract housing are common sights, and more and more continue to replace rolling countryside, farms, woods, and wetlands. However, due to strong opposition by residents and political officials, many acres of land have been preserved throughout the Delaware Valley. Older townships and large boroughs such as Cheltenham, Norristown, Jenkintown, Upper Darby and West Chester retain distinct community identities while engulfed in suburbia. The fastest-growing counties[when?] are Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, and Gloucester. Upper Darby, in Delaware County is the largest township in the United States.[citation needed] Sometimes Reading is included in the Delaware Valley Metro Area.[citation needed]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>The Delaware Valley has four distinct seasons with ample precipitation and is divided by the 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) January isotherm. Most of Philadelphia and the NJ portion, almost all of the DE and MD portions, part of Delaware County, and extreme southern portions of Bucks and Chester Counties have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and normally do vary widely within the Delaware Valley. The region has only two ski areas: Bear Creek Ski and Recreation Area in eastern Berks County and Spring Mountain in central Montgomery County.</p><p>Using the -3&nbsp;°C January isotherm as a boundary, all of the Delaware Valley is humid subtropical except for portions of Berks County and higher areas of northern Chester County. The warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) only exists in higher areas of Berks where all monthly temperatures average below 22&nbsp;°C.</p><h2>Colonial history[edit]</h2><p>See also: Thirteen Colonies</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The valley was the territory of the Susquehannock and Lenape, who are recalled in place names throughout the region. The region became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland after the exploration of Delaware Bay in 1609. The Dutch called the Delaware River the Zuyd Rivier, or South River, and considered the lands along it banks and those of its bay to be the southern flank of its province of New Netherland. In 1638, it began to be settled by Swedes, Forest Finns, Dutch, and Walloons and became the colony of New Sweden, though this was not officially recognized by the Dutch Empire which re-asserted control in 1655. The area was taken by the English in 1664.[31] The name Delaware comes from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who had arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1610, just as original settlers were about to abandon it, and thus maintaining the English foothold on the North American continent.</p><h2>Transportation[edit]</h2><p>Many residents commute to jobs in Philadelphia, Camden, and Wilmington with the help of expressways and trains. Commutes from one suburb to another are also common, as office parks have sprung up in new commercial centers such as King of Prussia, Fort Washington, Cherry Hill, and Plymouth Meeting.</p><h3>Commuter rail[edit]</h3><p>Formerly, the region was served by the Delaware Valley Railway.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Thirty_St_Station.jpg/220px-Thirty_St_Station.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Philadelphia's 30th St. Station has SEPTA Regional Rail and Amtrak service</p><h3>Major highways[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/I-95_SB_approaching_Girard_Avenue-Lehigh_Avenue.JPG/220px-I-95_SB_approaching_Girard_Avenue-Lehigh_Avenue.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Traffic heading into Philadelphia on Interstate 95.</p><p>Pennsylvania</p><p>New Jersey</p><p>Delaware</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often subdivided into Asia and Europe (red shades), while North and South America are sometimes recognised as one American continent (green shades).</p><p>A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[1]</p><p>Geologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).</p><p>Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions and application[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Dymaxion_map_unfolded-no-ocean.png/220px-Dymaxion_map_unfolded-no-ocean.png" width="220" height="126"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A Dymaxion map shows land masses with minimal shape distortion.</p><p>By convention, continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.[2] Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion large leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) is deemed the smallest continent.</p><p>Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]</p><h3>Extent[edit]</h3><p>The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as the Continent) is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.</p><p>From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]</p><p>From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Island_nations.svg/300px-Island_nations.svg.png" width="300" height="154"><br><p>Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.</p><p>As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]</p><h3>Separation[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Boundaries between the continents of Earth
See also: List of transcontinental countries</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as more or less discrete masses of land.[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.</p><p>North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.</p><p>The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]</p><p>If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.</p><p>When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia–New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.</p><h3>Number[edit]</h3><p> There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:</p><p>The term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.</p><h2>Highest and lowest points[edit]</h2><p>See also: Extremes on Earth, Extreme points of Earth, and Seven Summits</p><p>The following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.</p><p>† The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (-1,512 metres (-4,961&nbsp;ft)[27]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (-2,540 metres (-8,330&nbsp;ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some sources list the Kuma–Manych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc (elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe - the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.</p><h2>Other divisions[edit]</h2><h3>Supercontinents[edit]</h3><p>Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.</p><h3>Subcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[28] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[28]</p><p>In many of these cases, the subcontinents concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[29] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[30][31] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.</p><p>Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[32][33][34] or three (with Central America being the third).[35][36] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[28]</p><h3>Submerged continents[edit]</h3><p>Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.</p><h3>Microcontinents[edit]</h3><p>Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as the eighth continent from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[37]</p><h3>Botanical continents[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/WGSRPD_World.svg/300px-WGSRPD_World.svg.png" width="300" height="164"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>"Botanical continents" defined by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.</p><p>Continents may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine botanical continents. Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[38]</p><h2>History of continental configurations[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Geological history of the Earth</p><h2>History of the concept[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Strabo.jpg/187px-Strabo.jpg" width="187" height="226"><br><p>The Ancient Greek geographer Strabo holding a globe showing Europa and Asia</p><h3>Early concepts of the Old World continents[edit]</h3><p>The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[39] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[40] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and ...&nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...[39]</p><p>Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[41] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[42] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[43] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[44] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (Libya) and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[45] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.</p><p>Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them islands. Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents peninsulas. These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[46]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>Medieval T and O map showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah—Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham).</p><p>Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away.[47]</p><h3>European arrival in the Americas[edit]</h3><p>Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.</p><p>In 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[48] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (New World), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[49] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[50] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa,[51] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.</p><p>Within a few years the name New World began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[50]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg/375px-Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg" width="375" height="208"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia</p><p>In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named America after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[52] On the map, the word America was placed on part of South America.</p><h3>The word continent[edit]</h3><p>From the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[53] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[54] The noun was used to mean a connected or continuous tract of land or mainland.[53] It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[53] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three parts of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[55]</p><p>While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa. In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia, The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new. And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.[56] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as parts of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png/250px-Thevenot_-_Hollandia_Nova_detecta_1644.png" width="250" height="198"><br><p>Hollandia Nova, 1659 map prepared by Joan Blaeu based on voyages by Abel Tasman and Willem Jansz, this image shows a French edition of 1663</p><h3>Beyond four continents[edit]</h3><p>From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[57]</p><p>Europeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[57] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[58]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Antarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great Antarctic (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[59]</p><p>From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[60]</p><p>From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[60] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]</p><p>Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[61] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Continental crust and Plate tectonics</p><p>Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian shield, typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are high and dry; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[62]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg/350px-Plates_tect2_en.svg.png" width="350" height="239"><br><p>The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal rafts that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.</p><p>There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[63][64] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.</p><p>Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (continental rocks, plate boundaries) are used as appropriate.</p><p>The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.[65][66] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes;[4] its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%.[1] The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>For much of European history, the north polar regions remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. Pytheas of Massilia recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called Eschate Thule, where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance on which one can neither walk nor sail. He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as growlers or bergy bits; his Thule was probably Norway, though the Faroe Islands or Shetland have also been suggested.[5]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg/220px-Map_of_the_Arctic%2C_1780s_-_B%26W.jpeg" width="220" height="189"><br><p>Emanuel Bowen's 1780s map of the Arctic features a "Northern Ocean".</p><p>Early cartographers were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in Johannes Ruysch's map of 1507, or Gerardus Mercator's map of 1595) or water (as with Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the Northern Sea Route or the Northwest Passage, to Cathay (China) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as Johann Homann featured an extensive Oceanus Septentrionalis at the northern edge of their charts.</p><p>The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the Arctic Circle in this era added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of navigational charts, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the myth of an Open Polar Sea was persistent. John Barrow, longtime Second Secretary of the British Admiralty, promoted exploration of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.</p><p>In the United States in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers Elisha Kane and Isaac Israel Hayes both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority Matthew Fontaine Maury included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook The Physical Geography of the Sea (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who travelled closer and closer to the pole reported, the polar ice cap is quite thick, and persists year-round.</p><p>Fridtjof Nansen was the first to make a nautical crossing of the Arctic Ocean, in 1896. The first surface crossing of the ocean was led by Wally Herbert in 1969, in a dog sled expedition from Alaska to Svalbard, with air support.[6] The first nautical transit of the north pole was made in 1958 by the submarine USS Nautilus, and the first surface nautical transit occurred in 1977 by the icebreaker NS Arktika.</p><p>Since 1937, Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations have extensively monitored the Arctic Ocean.

The Russian continental shelf consists of three separate, smaller shelves, the Barents Shelf, Chukchi Sea Shelf and Siberian Shelf. Of these three, the Siberian Shelf is the largest such shelf in the world. The Siberian Shelf holds large oil and gas reserves, and the Chukchi shelf forms the border between Russian and the United States as stated in the USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement. The whole area is subject to international territorial claims.</p><h3>Underwater features[edit]</h3><p>An underwater ridge, the Lomonosov Ridge, divides the deep sea North Polar Basin into two oceanic basins: the Eurasian Basin, which is between 4,000 and 4,500&nbsp;m (13,100 and 14,800&nbsp;ft) deep, and the Amerasian Basin (sometimes called the North American, or Hyperborean Basin), which is about 4,000&nbsp;m (13,000&nbsp;ft) deep. The bathymetry of the ocean bottom is marked by fault block ridges, abyssal plains, ocean deeps, and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 1,038&nbsp;m (3,406&nbsp;ft).[13] The deepest point is Litke Deep in the Eurasian Basin, at 5,450&nbsp;m (17,880&nbsp;ft).</p><p>The two major basins are further subdivided by ridges into the Canada Basin (between Alaska/Canada and the Alpha Ridge), Makarov Basin (between the Alpha and Lomonosov Ridges), Amundsen Basin (between Lomonosov and Gakkel ridges), and Nansen Basin (between the Gakkel Ridge and the continental shelf that includes the Franz Josef Land).</p><h2>Oceanography[edit]</h2><h3>Water flow[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg/650px-BrnBld_BeringToFram.svg.png" width="650" height="200"><p>Distribution of the major water mass in the Arctic Ocean.

It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams (Ob, Yenisei, Lena, Mackenzie), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called halocline, in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Copepodkils.jpg/250px-Copepodkils.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>A Copepod</p><p>Because of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It is classified as a mediterranean sea, which as “a part of the world ocean which has only limited communication with the major ocean basins (these being the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans) and where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing”.[14] The Arctic Ocean has a total volume of 18.07×106 km3, equal to about 1.3% of the World Ocean. Mean surface circulation is predominately cyclonic on the Eurasian side and anticyclonic in the Canadian Basin.[15]</p><p>Water enters from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can be divided into three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around 900 metres (3,000 feet) depth.[14] It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow Bering Strait at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the Chukchi Sea.[16] During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4&nbsp;cm/s.[15] This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a halocline.[17]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png/220px-Nares_strait_border_%28Kennedy_channel%29.png" width="220" height="156"><br><p>The Kennedy Channel.</p><p>This water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.[14] Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the depth range of 150–900 metres (490–2,950 feet) is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the North Atlantic Current enters through the Fram Strait, cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the Arctic Basin counter-clockwise. This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.[16] It flows slowly, at about 0.02&nbsp;m/s.[14] Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&nbsp;°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density.[14] When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the Beaufort Gyre. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.[17]</p><p>The final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from 150–200 metres (490–660 feet). The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the Siberian Shelf.[14] As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3-0.6&nbsp;m/s.[14] Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.</p><p>Waters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard Island, which is about 2,700 metres (8,900 feet) deep and 350 kilometres (220 miles) wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.[16] The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the Coriolis force, which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the Norwegian Current on the eastern side.[14] Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the Hudson Strait (1-2 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.[16]</p><p>As noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses. With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year. For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the Siberian High system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.[15] During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a sea level pressure (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the Icelandic Low, which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to centre over the North Pole in the summer. These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months. There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.[15]</p><h3>Sea ice[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg/300px-2007_Arctic_Sea_Ice.jpg" width="300" height="251"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Sea cover in the Arctic Ocean, showing the median, 2005 and 2007 coverage [18]


Main article: Arctic ice pack</p><p>Much of the Arctic Ocean is covered by sea ice that varies in extent and thickness seasonally. The mean extent of the ice has been decreasing since 1980 from the average winter value of 15,600,000&nbsp;km2 (6,023,200&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) at a rate of 3% per decade. The seasonal variations are about 7,000,000&nbsp;km2 (2,702,700&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) with the maximum in April and minimum in September. The sea ice is affected by wind and ocean currents, which can move and rotate very large areas of ice. Zones of compression also arise, where the ice piles up to form pack ice.[19][20][21]</p><p>Icebergs occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island, and icebergs are formed from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. These icebergs pose a hazard to ships, of which the Titanic is one of the most famous. Permafrost is found on most islands. The ocean is virtually icelocked from October to June, and the superstructure of ships are subject to icing from October to May.[11] Before the advent of modern icebreakers, ships sailing the Arctic Ocean risked being trapped or crushed by sea ice (although the Baychimo drifted through the Arctic Ocean untended for decades despite these hazards).</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>See also: Climate change in the Arctic</p><br><img alt="File:North Pole Sea Ice 1990-1999.ogv" style="width:210px;height:158px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv/210px--North_Pole_Sea_Ice_1990-1999.ogv.jpg"><p>Play media


Changes in ice between 1990–1999</p><p>Under the influence of the Quaternary glaciation, the Arctic Ocean is contained in a polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by the polar night, extreme cold, frequent low-level temperature inversions, and stable weather conditions.[22] Cyclones are only common on the Atlantic side.[23] Summers are characterized by continuous daylight (midnight sun), and temperatures can rise above the melting point (0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F). Cyclones are more frequent in summer and may bring rain or snow.[23] It is cloudy year-round, with mean cloud cover ranging from 60% in winter to over 80% in summer.[24]</p><p>The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Because the Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater, the temperature must reach -1.8&nbsp;°C (28.8&nbsp;°F) before freezing occurs.</p><p>The density of sea water, in contrast to fresh water, increases as it nears the freezing point and thus it tends to sink. It is generally necessary that the upper 100–150&nbsp;m (330–490&nbsp;ft) of ocean water cools to the freezing point for sea ice to form.[25] In the winter the relatively warm ocean water exerts a moderating influence, even when covered by ice. This is one reason why the Arctic does not experience the extreme temperatures seen on the Antarctic continent.</p><p>There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50&nbsp;cm (7.9 to 19.7&nbsp;in) over the frozen ocean.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20&nbsp;°C (50–68&nbsp;°F).[26] The surface waters of the northernmost[27] Arctic Ocean warmed, seasonally at least, enough to support tropical lifeforms[28] requiring surface temperatures of over 22&nbsp;°C (72&nbsp;°F).[29]</p><h2>Animal and plant life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg/220px-Polar_bears_near_north_pole.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Three polar bears approach USS Honolulu near the North Pole.</p><p>Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem which is slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage.[11] Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean.</p><p>The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton.[30] Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.[31] During summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to photosynthesize for long periods of time and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter when they struggle to get enough light to survive.[31]</p><h2>Natural resources[edit]</h2><p>See also: Natural resources of the Arctic, Territorial claims in the Arctic, and Marine mammal</p><p>Petroleum and natural gas fields, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, fish, seals and whales can all be found in abundance in the region.[11][21]</p><p>The political dead zone near the centre of the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark.[32] It is significant for the global energy market because it may hold 25% or more of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources.[33]</p><h2>Environmental concerns[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: Climate change in the Arctic, Ozone depletion, and Pollution in the Arctic Ocean</p><h3>Arctic ice melting[edit]</h3><p>The Arctic ice pack is thinning, and in many years there is also a seasonal hole in the ozone layer.[34] Reduction of the area of Arctic sea ice reduces the planet's average albedo, possibly resulting in global warming in a positive feedback mechanism.[21][35] Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free for the first time in human history within a few years or by 2040.[36][37] Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.[38]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.[35]</p><p>As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.[39]</p><h3>Clathrate breakdown[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Clathrate gun hypothesis</p><br><img alt="Extinction intensity.svg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Extinction_intensity.svg/320px-Extinction_intensity.svg.png" width="320" height="195" usemap="#ImageMap_1_838532597"><p>Marine extinction intensity during the Phanerozoic

Melting of this ice may release large quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, causing further warming in a strong positive feedback cycle and; marine genus and species to become extinct.[40][41]</p><h3>Other concerns[edit]</h3><p>Other environmental concerns relate to the radioactive contamination of the Arctic Ocean from, for example, Russian radioactive waste dump sites in the Kara Sea[42] and Cold War nuclear test sites such as Novaya Zemlya.[43] In addition, Shell planned to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas during the summer of 2012, which environmental groups filed a lawsuit about in an attempt to protect native communities, endangered wildlife, and the Arctic Ocean in the event of a major oil spill.[44]</p><p>On July 16, 2015, five nations (United States of America, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark/Greenland) signed a declaration committing to keep their fishing vessels out of a 1.1 million square mile zone in the central Arctic Ocean near the North Pole.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>This is a list of contiguous urban areas of the world ordered according to population as of 2014/2015. The figures here have been taken from Demographia's World Urban Areas study.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definitions and issues</h2><p>For more details on definitions, see World's largest cities.</p><p>Demographia defines an urban area (urbanized area agglomeration or urban centre) as a continuously built up land mass of urban development that is within a labor market (i.e. metropolitan area or metropolitan region), without regard for administrative boundaries (i.e. municipality, city or commune). Except in Australia, the authorities use a minimum urban density definition of 400 persons per square kilometer (or the nearly identical 1,000 per square mile in the United States). Demographia uses maps, satellite photographs to estimate continuous urbanization. Demographia also uses small area population data, where available, to match population estimates to urbanized land area. National census authority data are presented in Australia, Canada, France, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Census of India urban agglomerations are not used in some cases because the geographical size of constituent units (municipalities) often includes large rural (non-urban) areas.</p><p>Sources for population estimates and land area definitions are coded by letter in the Table below, respectively.</p><p>A: National census authority data agglomeration data (land area or population).

This is evident, for example, in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Seoul and Moscow, where the UN data are for political jurisdictions, rather than urban areas. In other cases, the UN data is for metropolitan area, which are larger than urban areas (such as in Brazil). Finally, the United Nations data is incomplete, excluding some significant urban areas (such as Essen–Düsseldorf in Germany).[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Urban areas are confined to a single nation, unless there is freedom of movement (including labor) between the adjacent nations. Currently, this condition is met only between some continental nations of the European Union and Switzerland (e.g. Lille–Kortrijk in both France and Belgium, Aachen–Vaals in both Germany and Netherlands, Saarbrücken–Forbach in both Germany and France, Geneva–Annemasse in both Switzerland and France, and Basel–Lörrach–Saint-Louis in Switzerland, Germany and France). Thus, Detroit–Windsor in both the United States and Canada, and San Diego–Tijuana in both the United States and Mexico are not treated as single urban areas. Moreover, Shenzhen–Hong Kong is treated as separate urban areas, principally because labor movement between the two is limited, with the former within China and the latter a special administrative region of China.[citation needed]</p><p>According to the report, there are 875 identified urban areas in the world with 500,000 or more population as of 2013.

Main article: Long Island</p><p>Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region wholly within both the U.S. state of New York and the New York City metropolitan area. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (these form the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, most people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Queens and Brooklyn) colloquially use the term Long Island (or The Island) exclusively to refer to the Nassau-Suffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character.[44] North of the island is Long Island Sound, across which are the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p><p>With a Census-estimated population of 7,838,722 in 2015, constituting nearly 40% of New York State's population,[45][46][47][48][49] The majority of New York City residents, 58% as of 2015, now live on Long Island, namely the estimated the 4,896,398 residents living in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.[50] Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory, and the 17th-most populous island in the world (ahead of Ireland, Jamaica, and Hokkaido). Its population density is 5,571 inhabitants per square mile (2,151/km2). If Long Island geographically constituted an independent metropolitan statistical area, it would rank fourth most populous in the United States; while if it were a U.S. state, Long Island would rank 13th in population and first in population density. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[51][52] The Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, with an estimated population of 770,367 in 2016, is the most populous municipality in the New York metropolitan area outside of New York City.[43]</p><p>Long Island is the most populated island in the United States and the 17th most populous island in the world. Known especially for recreation, boating and miles of public beaches, including numerous town, county and state parks and Fire Island National Seashore. Along the north shore, the Gold Coast of Long Island is an upscale section of Nassau and western Suffolk counties that once featured many lavish mansions built and inhabited by wealthy business tycoons in the earlier years of the 20th century, of which only a few remain preserved as historic sites. The East End of Long Island (known as the Twin Forks because of its physical shape) boasts open spaces for farmland and wineries. The South Fork, in particular, comprises numerous towns and villages known collectively as The Hamptons and has an international reputation as a playground for the rich and famous, with some of the wealthiest communities in the United States. In 2015, according to Business Insider, the 11962 zip code encompassing Sagaponack, within Southampton, was listed as the most expensive in the U.S. by real estate-listings site Property Shark, with a median home sale price of $5,125,000.[53] During the summer season, many celebrities and the wealthy visit or reside in mansions and waterfront homes, while others spend weekends enjoying the beaches, gardens, bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Long Island is served by a network of parkways and expressways, with the Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway, and Southern State Parkway being major east-west routes across significant portions of the island.

Air travel needs are served by several airports. Within Queens, the island is home to John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, two of the three major airline hubs serving the New York City area (with Newark Liberty International Airport being the third; all three major airports are operated by The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey). Islip MacArthur Airport (serving commercial airlines) and Farmingdale/Republic Airport (private and commuter flights) are both located in Suffolk County.</p><p>Northern New Jersey[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bigfalls14w_info.jpg/220px-Bigfalls14w_info.jpg" width="220" height="137"><br><p>The Great Falls of the Passaic River in Paterson, Passaic County, New Jersey, dedicated as a National Historical Park in November 2011, incorporates one of the largest waterfalls in the eastern United States.[54]

Northern New Jersey is home to four of the largest cities of that state: Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Elizabeth.</p><p>The region is geographically diverse with wetlands, mountains, and valleys throughout the area. It has a large network of expressways and public transportation rail services, mostly operated by New Jersey Transit. Northern New Jersey also contains the second busiest airport in the New York City metropolitan area, Newark Liberty International Airport.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/2009-08-17_View_of_downtown_Trenton_in_New_Jersey_and_the_mouth_of_the_Assunpink_Creek_from_across_the_Delaware_River_in_Morrisville%2C_Pennsylvania.jpg/275px-2009-08-17_View_of_downtown_Trenton_in_New_Jersey_and_the_mouth_of_the_Assunpink_Creek_from_across_the_Delaware_River_in_Morrisville%2C_Pennsylvania.jpg" width="275" height="117"><br><p>Downtown Trenton in Mercer County, including the New Jersey State House topped by its golden dome, alongside the Delaware River.

Lower Hudson Valley[edit]
Main article: Hudson Valley</p><p>Known for its hilly terrain, picturesque settings, and quaint small towns and villages, the Lower Hudson Valley is centered around the Hudson River north of New York City and lies within New York State. Its two most populous counties, Westchester and Rockland, are located on the eastern and western sides of the river, respectively, connected by the heavily trafficked Tappan Zee Bridge (a major commuter route from Rockland County towards New York City) as well as the Bear Mountain Bridge near their northern ends. Several branches of the MTA Metro-North Railroad serve the region's rail commuters. Southern Westchester County contains more densely populated areas and includes the cities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and White Plains. Although many of the suburban communities of Westchester are known for their affluence and expense (some examples: Scarsdale, Chappaqua, Armonk, Katonah, and Briarcliff Manor), the Lower Hudson Valley as a whole is one of the fastest-growing areas in the metropolitan area because of high housing costs in New York City and the inner suburbs.</p><p>Historically, the valley was home to many factories, including paper mills, but a significant number have closed. After years of lingering pollution, cleanup efforts to improve the Hudson River water quality are currently planned and will be supervised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[56]</p><p>Western Connecticut[edit]</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/MohawkMountain.jpg/220px-MohawkMountain.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Mohawk Mountain Ski Area in Cornwall, Litchfield County, Connecticut, in the Berkshire Mountains.

Large business and industrial parks are scattered throughout the area, though mostly contained within Fairfield County. The three counties (and Connecticut in general) are known for affluence. Geographically, the areas are flat along the coast with low hills eventually giving way to larger hills such as The Berkshires further inland, to the Massachusetts border. Most of the largest cities in the state are located within New Haven County (home to Yale University) and Fairfield County.</p><p>Monroe and Pike Counties, Pennsylvania[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Dingmansfalls.jpg/220px-Dingmansfalls.jpg" width="220" height="291"><br><p>Dingmans Falls in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Pike County, northeastern Pennsylvania.

Main article: Pike County, Pennsylvania</p><p>Pike County is located in northeastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 57,369.[57] Its county seat is Milford.[58] Part of the Pocono Mountains region lies within Pike County, which has ranked among the fastest-growing counties of Pennsylvania.[59]</p><p>Monroe County was added to the CMSA in March 2013, as was the Lehigh Valley. Monroe's county seat is Stroudsburg, and its largest borough is East Stroudsburg. Monroe and Pike are the fastest-growing counties in Pennsylvania and are home to many residents who commute to jobs in Northern New Jersey and New York City. They are located largely in the Pocono Mountains and have multiple state parks as well as most of the Pennsylvania portion of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Efforts continue to resume passenger rail service on the Lackawanna Cutoff route between Scranton and Northern New Jersey via Monroe County.</p><p>Lehigh Valley[edit]
Main articles: Carbon County, Pennsylvania; Lehigh County, Pennsylvania; Northampton County, Pennsylvania; and Warren County, New Jersey</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA (better known as the Lehigh Valley) consists of Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton counties. It constitutes the third-largest metropolitan area of Pennsylvania, and Allentown is the state's third-largest city. The region is important for east-west transportation between New York City, northern and central New Jersey, the Harrisburg metropolitan area, and points west, both by rail and Interstate 78. It is also critical for north-south road traffic via Interstate 476 and the Route 33 Expressway. The Lehigh Valley is in the process of major urban economic redevelopment, including development of the logistics industry as well as the Two Rivers Landing in downtown Easton, the Steel Stacks/Sands complex on the south side of Bethlehem, and a multi-purpose arena (which hosted its first event on September 12, 2014) in downtown Allentown. In 2010 the population was 712,481 for the PA portion and 821,173 in the MSA as a whole. While a large portion of Carbon County is in the Pocono Mountains, it is also in the Lehigh River valley and the employment interchange is mainly with Lehigh and Northampton Counties.</p><h3>Urban areas of the region[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg/220px-StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Downtown Stamford in Fairfield County, Connecticut.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/NewHavenCT_Green.jpg/220px-NewHavenCT_Green.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>The New Haven Green Historic District in Connecticut was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1970.[60]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fullnycskyline.jpg/1600px-Fullnycskyline.jpg" width="1600" height="238"><p>Skyline of New York City and Jersey City from Newark, New Jersey, seen prior to completion of One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
