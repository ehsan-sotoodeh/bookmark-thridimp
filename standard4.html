	<div class="content"><p>In 1955, the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all states except for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Vatican City. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation.[11] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The European Anthem is Ode to Joy and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Name</h2><p>Further information: Europa (mythology)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Herodotus_World_Map.jpg/330px-Herodotus_World_Map.jpg" width="330" height="193"><br><p>Reconstruction of Herodotus' world map (450 BC)</p><p>In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient&nbsp;Greek: ????p?, Eur?pe) is the name of either a Phoenician princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements e???? (eurús), wide, broad[12] and ?? (ops, gen. ?p??, opós) eye, face, countenance,[13] hence their composite Eur?pe would mean wide-gazing or broad of aspect. Broad has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[14] For the second part compare also the divine attributes of grey-eyed Athena (??a???p??, glaukopis) or ox-eyed Hera (ß??p??, boopis).</p><p>There have been attempts to connect Eur?pe to a Semitic term for west, this being either Akkadian erebu meaning to go down, set (said of the sun) or Phoenician 'ereb evening, west,[15] which is at the origin of Arabic Maghreb and Hebrew ma'arav. Michael A. Barry, professor in Princeton University's Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of night, [the country of] sunset, in opposition to Asu [the country of] sunrise, i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to cartographic convention appears in Greek ??at??? (Anatol? [sun] rise, east, hence Anatolia).[16] Martin Litchfield West stated that phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor.[17] Next to these hypotheses there is also a Proto-Indo-European root *h1reg?os, meaning darkness, which also produced Greek Erebus.</p><p>Most major world languages use words derived from Eur?pe or Europa to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word Ouzhou (??/??); a similar Chinese-derived term Oshu (??) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, Oshu Rengo (????), despite the katakana Yoroppa (?????) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan (land of the Franks) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa.[18]</p><h2>Definition</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Further information: List of transcontinental countries and Boundaries between continents</p><h3>Contemporary definition</h3><p>Clickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[19]

Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.[20]</p><p>Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Europe as used specifically in British English may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[22]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>A medieval T and O map from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah — Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham)</p><p>The first recorded usage of Eur?pe as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC.[23] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[24] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[25] The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[26]</p><p>The convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[27] Strabo[28] and Ptolemy,[29] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.</p><p>The term Europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.</p><p>A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[30] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: Europa often[dubious – discuss] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[31]</p><p>Modern definitions

But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.</p><p>Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains.[32] introducing the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard.[33]</p><p>The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[34][35] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.</p><p>By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.[36]</p><p>In Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[37] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[38] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[39] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest[40] and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Europe</p><h3>Prehistory</h3><p>Main article: Prehistoric Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lascaux_painting.jpg/260px-Lascaux_painting.jpg" width="260" height="170"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c 15,000 BC)</p><p>Homo erectus georgicus, which lived roughly 1.8&nbsp;million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe.[41] Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1&nbsp;million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[42] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and their final refuge being present-day Portugal.

Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[45] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.[46][47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BC in Greece with the Minoan civilization on Crete, the first advanced civilization in Europe.[48] The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BC, ushering the European Iron Age.[49] Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BC gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BC, the year the first Olympic Games.[50]</p><p>Main article: Classical antiquity

Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[51] The Greeks city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[51] In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[52] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[53] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[54][55][56] In the course of the 5th century BC, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[57] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/RomanEmpire_117.svg/260px-RomanEmpire_117.svg.png" width="260" height="191"><br><p>The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg/170px-Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg" width="170" height="246"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Augustus wearing the Civic Crown</p><p>Greece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[51] Expanding from their base in Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BC, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe.[58]</p><p>The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[59][60] The Empire began to decline in the 3rd century, particularly in the west. Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 AD after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople in his honour (modern-day Istanbul) in 330 AD. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 AD, and in 391-392 AD, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[61] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 AD;[62] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century AD.</p><p>Main articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages

There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars.[58] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the Dark Ages.[63] Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[64]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia, and brought the Christian church under state control.[65]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Rolandfealty.jpg/160px-Rolandfealty.jpg" width="160" height="178"><p>Roland pledges fealty to Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Delegation_of_Croats_and_Serbs_to_Emperor_Basil_I%2C_Skylitzes.jpg/160px-Delegation_of_Croats_and_Serbs_to_Emperor_Basil_I%2C_Skylitzes.jpg" width="160" height="79"><p>Delegations of Croats and Serbs at Byzantine court of Basil I</p><p>From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[66] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[67] Between 711 and 720, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule&nbsp;— save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance.</p><p>During the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.[68] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis&nbsp;I.[69] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[70]</p><p>East Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[71][72] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[73]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>High and Late Middle Ages</h3><p>Main articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages

Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Philip_II_and_Tancred_meeting_in_Messina_-_British_Library_Royal_MS_16_G_vi_f350r_%28detail%29.jpg/200px-Philip_II_and_Tancred_meeting_in_Messina_-_British_Library_Royal_MS_16_G_vi_f350r_%28detail%29.jpg" width="200" height="204"><br><p>Tancred of Sicily and Philip II of France, during the Third Crusade (1189–1192)</p><p>The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.[74] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament.[75] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[74]</p><p>The Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[76] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula.[77]</p><p>In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[78] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[88][89][90]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mongols_suzdal.jpg/170px-Mongols_suzdal.jpg" width="170" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe.</p><p>In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[91] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[92] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[93][94] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[95] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.</p><p>The Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[96] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[97][98] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[99] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[100] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25&nbsp;million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[101]</p><p>The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, foreigners, beggars and lepers.[102] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[103] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[104]</p><p>Main article: Early modern period

The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.[105][106][107] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church, and an emerging merchant class.[108][109][110] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.[111][112]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in Avignon and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church.

The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[114] This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[115] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[116]</p><p>The 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline.[117] Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[118] From the Union of Krewo (1385) central and eastern Europe was dominated by Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1648 and 1655 in the central and eastern Europe ended hegemony of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[119] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia). Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, laying siege to Vienna in 1529. In the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the Battle of Vienna permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe.</p><p>The Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development.[120] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Isaac Newton.[121] According to Peter Barrett, It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.[105]</p><p>In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Portugal and Spain, two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[122][123] Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia.[124] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>18th and 19th centuries</h3><p>Main article: Modern history

These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[135] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[136]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png/170px-The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png" width="170" height="203"><br><p>Ottoman Europe in 1856</p><p>In parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774).

The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912-1913.[137] Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg/220px-Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg" width="220" height="168"><br><p>Marshall's Temple Works (1840), the Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain</p><p>The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe.

The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.[156]</p><p>Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.[157] In 1932–1933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths;[158] surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[159] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[160]</p><p>The social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany, and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy, and in Ataturk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet, and state secularism. Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[161][162]</p><p>In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic.

Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of World War II.[163][164] The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources.

In 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60&nbsp;million dead across the world.[169] More than 40&nbsp;million people in Europe had died as a result of World War II,[170] including between 11 and 17&nbsp;million people who perished during the Holocaust.[171] The Soviet Union lost around 27&nbsp;million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties.[172] By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40&nbsp;million refugees.[173] Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20&nbsp;million people.[174]</p><p>World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an Iron Curtain. The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact.[175]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Schuman_Declaration.jpg/290px-Schuman_Declaration.jpg" width="290" height="213"><br><p>The Schuman Declaration led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community.

At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.[10] In the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War.

The EU established a parliament, court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[178] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[179]</p><h2>Geography</h2><p>Main article: Geography of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Europe_topography_map_en.png/220px-Europe_topography_map_en.png" width="220" height="179"><br><p>Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions</p><p>Europe makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[20] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[180] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.[181] Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.</p><p>This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.</p><h3>Climate</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Climate of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Vegetation_Europe.png/220px-Vegetation_Europe.png" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.[182] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed Europe's central heating, because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;°C (61&nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&nbsp;°C (54&nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude.

He also came to believe that Amerigo Vespucci had discovered South America.</p><p>Upon his return, Ringmann moved to Saint-Dié-des-Vosges in Lorraine with his friend, Martin Waldseemüller, a cartographer with whom he was working on a new Latin edition of Ptolemy's treatise on geography. Waldseemüller drew the maps while Ringmann edited the translation and wrote the preface. Ringmann was probably also the author of the introduction to Waldseemüller's great map and globe of the world, yet many historians attribute the work to Waldseemüller himself. Some historians have judged that Walter Ludd, the head of the Gymnasium Vosagense, paid Ringmann and Waldseemüller to do this work for publication at the Gymnasium's printing press at St. Dié.</p><p>Ringmann also may have read the French edition of Vespucci's letters, (Quatre Navigations d' Americ Vespuce). Since Vespucci's written accounts were in Italian, the translation to French could have been the source of Ringmann's misunderstanding of the accepted discoverer of the New World, as he believed that Vespucci discovered the new world. He described this in his introduction:</p><p>There is a fourth quarter of the world which Amerigo Vespucci has discovered and which for this reason we can call 'America' or the land of Americus [the Latin version of the Italian name Amerigo]. […] We do not see why the name of the man of genius, Amerigo, who has discovered them, should not be given to these lands, as Europe and Asia have adopted the names of women.</p><p>When the book was published by the name Cosmographiae Introductio on April 25, 1507, it was the first time that the word 'Americas' appeared in print. Waldseemüller corrected the error in a later edition and named South America Terra Nova, but the name America had now already been established.</p><p>Ringmann corrected the texts of the Latin editions of Ptolemy's geography—which had been published previously at Rome and Ulm using a Greek manuscript borrowed from Italy (Codex Vaticanum Graecorum 191.) During this time, Waldseemüller edited the Ptolemaic maps and also added twenty new maps to the collection. This was what was known as the first modern atlas of the world.</p><p>In 1508, Ringmann made the first translation of Julius Caesar's Commentaries into German with supplemental pieces by Suetonius, Plutarch, and others. One year later, he published a card game, Grammatica Figurata, to make the grammatical rules of Donatus', Ars Minor, more appealing to children. He died in 1511 in Sélestat.</p><h2>Grammatica Figurata[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/GrammaticaFigurata2.gif/220px-GrammaticaFigurata2.gif" width="220" height="282"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Grammatica Figurata (1509)</p><p>The Grammatica Figurata was first published by Mathias Ringmann in 1509. This work was an attempt to enliven Donatus' Ars Minor by printing up illustrated card sets for each grammatical rule. Apparently the children would have a card set. The rules are not explained at length, but a few hints are scattered here and there in the work. The final section on Exclamations has a sentence on how to figure out which student has won. Each card represented a part of speech, a gender, a case, or a tense, etc. Depending upon the teacher's questions a student would play the appropriate card or cards. Long believed to be lost, one copy of Grammatica figurata was found and reprinted in 1905.[2] Of particular interest are Ringmann's digressions on assorted subjects, from the prevalence of gambling among the German priesthood to the reasons behind his refusal to illustrate full-frontal nudity.</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><li id="cite_note-3">^ Jennie, Cohen.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd (1846 – 7 October 1920) was a native of Clifton, Bristol, England. An accountant as a young man, his means were such that he was able to pursue his interests as a naturalist and antiquarian. He was a member of a number of societies, often assuming leadership positions. Hudd is perhaps best known for his roles as author of Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District, editor of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, supervisor of the excavations undertaken by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, and author of Richard Ameryk and the name America.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background[edit]</h2><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd, son of leather merchant Samuel Hudd and his wife Mary Ann, was born in the second quarter of 1846 in Clifton.[1][2] An accountant, he married Catharine Bowles Edmonds in the first quarter of 1872, their marriage recorded in the registration district of Faringdon, Berkshire.[3] In 1881, Alfred and his wife resided at Clinton House on Pembroke Road in Clifton.[4]</p><h2>Naturalist[edit]</h2><p>By 1870, Hudd was a member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, which had been founded in 1862.[5][6] He was first appointed to the Council of the society on 6 May 1875, and remained a member of the Council for years, until about 1892.[7][8][9] After a hiatus as a Council member for several years, Hudd was reappointed to the Council in 1899, where he remained until at least 1901.[10] He specialised in entomology. His Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District was published in six parts in the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society:</p><p>Hudd was also a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London, founded in 1833, and now known as the Royal Entomological Society of London.[17][18] In 1912, he presented his collection of 1300 coleoptera (beetle) specimens to the Bristol Museum and Library, now the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, to supplement the Stephen Barton (d. 1898) collection. His collection of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) specimens was added to the George C. Griffiths (1852–1924) collection at the Bristol Museum.[18] Hudd also contributed a short chapter on The Insects of the Bristol District to the Handbook to Bristol and the neighbourhood.[19]</p><h2>Antiquarian[edit]</h2><p>Hudd was elected secretary of the Clifton Antiquarian Club at its first meeting on 23 January 1884 at the Bristol Museum and Library.[20] He retained that position during all twenty-eight years of the original society. Not only a founding member of the club, Alfred Edmund Hudd had the distinction of being the only member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club to remain with the original organisation from its inception in 1884 to its end in 1912. He served as editor of the society's seven volumes of Proceedings,[21] also contributing 21 papers.[22] His service to the organisation was acknowledged on 5 January 1898 when the club presented him with a silver bowl and a set of four silver candlesticks.[23] In 1911, the membership of the club again paid tribute to his efforts, with an inscribed, inlaid grandfather clock.[21]</p><p>Alfred Hudd was a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and served on its Council.[24][25] On 9 August 1904, he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland at a meeting of that organisation held at Tuam, County Galway.[26] In addition, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27]</p><h2>Caerwent Exploration Fund[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg/160px-Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg" width="160" height="213"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Excavations at Caerwent in south Wales</p><p>Alfred Hudd was closely involved with the Caerwent Exploration Fund. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in February 1899, Alfred Trice Martin, also a founding member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, suggested that a systematic excavation of Caerwent, a Roman town in south Wales, be undertaken.[27] The Caerwent Exploration Fund was established by the Clifton Antiquarian Club soon thereafter. In September 1899, at Caerwent, Godfrey Morgan, Lord Tredegar, was elected President of the Caerwent Exploration Fund and Alfred Hudd was elected Treasurer.[27][28] Hudd and Thomas Ashby, Junior, both members of the Executive Committee of the Fund, supervised the excavations at Caerwent.[29] During the period between 1899 and 1913, two-thirds of the Roman town in south Wales was revealed. The archive of Caerwent, which was discovered during the excavations by the Fund, is in the archaeology collection of Newport Museum.[29] The reports on the excavations at Caerwent were published in Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27] Much of the success of the Caerwent Exploration Fund has been attributed to Alfred Hudd.[30]</p><h2>The naming of America[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Stradanus_America.jpg/220px-Stradanus_America.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>America by Johannes Stradanus
(1523–1605). "Americus rediscovers America. He called her but once and thenceforth she was always awake."[31]</p><p>The traditional theory of the naming of America is that it was named in honour of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator. At the turn of the sixteenth century, Vespucci undertook a series of voyages (the number of which remains unresolved) in search of a western passage to the Indies. After the voyage of 1501–1502, he proposed that the areas that he and, separately, Christopher Columbus had explored were not part of Asia, but rather a New World.[32][33] America first received its name in the Cosmographiae Introductio, published by cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in 1507. Vespucci's published letters (the authenticity of which is contested) were the inspiration for that work, which was authored by a group of scholars in Saint-Dié, Lorraine, France. They revised Ptolemy's Geography to include the New World and reasoned that, as the three previously known continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, had feminine names, so should the New World. Accordingly, the feminised version of the Latin form of the baptismal name of the discoverer of the New World, Vespucci, was utilised.[32][33] The appendix of the book included Waldseemüller's map of the world in which the New World was labelled America. The map, rediscovered in a German castle in 1901, was the first to use the name America and the first to depict a Western Hemisphere.[33][34] The Library of Congress purchased the 1507 Waldseemüller map in 2003. On 30 April 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel transferred the map, also known as America's birth certificate, to the people of the United States in a ceremony at the Library of Congress.[35]</p><p>There are several alternate theories of the naming of America.[33] Alfred Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings. In Richard Ameryk and the name America, Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498–1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from King Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for handing over the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503).[33][36] Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Further, Hudd quoted a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497.[33][36]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This year (1497), on St. John the Baptist's day (June 24th), the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristow, in a ship of Bristowe called the 'Mathew,' the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe the 2nd of May and came home again the 6th August following.[36]</p><p>Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 Cosmographiae Introductio, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci.[33][36] While Hudd's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, there is no hard proof to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk.[33][37][38]</p><h2>Later life[edit]</h2><p>Hudd's first wife Kate died on 4 April 1889 and was buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery in Naples, Italy.[39] Hudd married Adeline Sophia Tyzack in the fourth quarter of 1891 in the registration district of Kensington, London.[3] In 1901, he resided at 94 Pembroke Road in Clifton with his second wife Adeline and two daughters.[40] Alfred Edmund Hudd of 108 Pembroke Road in Clifton died on 7 October 1920, his death registered in Bristol in the fourth quarter of the year. His estate of almost £16,000 went to probate on 17 December 1920. His wife survived him.[41][42]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

				This article is about the explorer. For other uses, see Amerigo Vespucci (disambiguation).</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci (Italian pronunciation:&nbsp;[ame'ri?go ves'putt?i]; March 9, 1454&nbsp;– February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Old Worlders.</p><p>Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed Americas, deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of Vespucci's first name.[1][2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background</h2><br><br><p>The birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was born and raised in Florence on the Italian Peninsula. He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.[3][4] The father of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci had the name Amerigo Vespucci also. [5]</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence. While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by Lorenzo de' Medici. Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.[3] In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with Christopher Columbus and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies. Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.[3] After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.[3]</p><h2>Expeditions</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>At the invitation of king Manuel I of Portugal, Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502. On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.</p><p>The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus. In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset Christopher Columbus' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.[citation needed]</p><h2>Historical role</h2><p>In 1508, the position of chief of navigation of Spain (piloto mayor de Indias) was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg/200px-Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Vespucci's first encounter with Native Americans in Honduras, 1497 (De Bry's illustration, c.1592)</p><p>Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. Mundus Novus (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from Lisbon to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502. Mundus Novus was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.[6] Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as Lettera al Soderini or just Lettera, was a letter in Italian addressed to Piero Soderini. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German Martin Waldseemüller in 1507 in Cosmographiae Introductio, a book on cosmography and geography, as Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).[6]</p><p>On March 22, 1508, King Ferdinand made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary[7] and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg/200px-Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg" width="200" height="133"><br><p>The first known depiction of cannibalism in the New World.

One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the four voyages. Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.[6]</p><p>Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in Lorraine. Vespucci used a Latinised form of his name, Americus Vespucius, in his Latin writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form America, according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women. It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him.[8]</p><p>The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.</p><p>Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.</p><h2>Voyages</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg/170px-Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg" width="170" height="297"><br><p>Portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child, part of the Madonna della Misericordia (c. 1472) by Domenico Ghirlandaio at the Ognissanti church in Florence</p><p>The first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabulous, but the second and third are certain.</p><h3>First voyage</h3><p>A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.[9] Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.[10] The names of Amerigo Vespucci's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Second voyage</h3><p>About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with Alonso de Ojeda (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.[11] After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of Hispaniola. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially [12] on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,[12] which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.</p><h3>Third voyage</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg/220px-Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg" width="220" height="299"><br><p>Portrait of Vespucci which titles him "discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land"</p><p>The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by Gonçalo Coelho in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal. Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of Pedro Álvares Cabral's ships returning from India. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.[11] On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif/lossless-page1-250px-%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif.png" width="250" height="183"><br><p>Vespucci awakens "America" in a Stradanus engraving (circa 1638)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula.[13] Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by Ptolemy or Marco Polo and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.[citation needed]</p><h3>Fourth voyage</h3><p>Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.[14] The only source of information for the last voyage is the Letter to Soderini,[15] but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip.[b] However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain Gonçalo Coelho, very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well.[16] However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.</p><p>The letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.[17]</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Vespucci was a cousin of the husband of Simonetta Vespucci. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.</p><h2>Final years</h2><p>Not long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by Ferdinand II of Aragon in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish House of Trade, based in Seville.</p><p>He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain.[18][19]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>a Europeans had long conceptualized the Afro-Eurasian landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: Europe, Asia, and Africa. Once cosmographers realized that the New World was not connected to the Old (but before its true geography was fully mapped), they considered the Americas to be a single, fourth continent.


b The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 Mundus Novus and the 1505 Letter of Soderini, the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924). He proposed the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the "Ridolfi fragment" (Formisiano, 1992: p.37–44) – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship. The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful. Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp. the first) differing from Arciniegas. Fernández-Armesto (2007: p.128) declares the authenticity question "inconclusive", hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2> </h2><h2>References</h2><h2> </h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Newfoundland (/nju?f?n'lænd/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen) new-f?n-LAND;[5] Spanish: Terranova, French: Terre-Neuve, Mi'kmaq: Taqamkuk, Irish: Talamh an Éisc, Inuttitut: Kallunasillik / Ikkarumikluak[6]) is a large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland, and the most populous part of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It has 29 percent of the province's land area. The island is separated from the Labrador Peninsula by the Strait of Belle Isle and from Cape Breton Island by the Cabot Strait. It blocks the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, creating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the world's largest estuary. Newfoundland's nearest neighbour is the French overseas community of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.</p><p>With an area of 108,860 square kilometres (42,031&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[7] Newfoundland is the world's 16th-largest island, Canada's fourth-largest island, and the largest Canadian island outside the North. The provincial capital, St. John's, is located on the southeastern coast of the island; Cape Spear, just south of the capital, is the easternmost point of North America, excluding Greenland. It is common to consider all directly neighbouring islands such as New World, Twillingate, Fogo and Bell Island to be 'part of Newfoundland' (as distinct from Labrador). By that classification, Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of 111,390 square kilometres (43,008&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).[8]</p><p>According to 2006 official Census Canada statistics, 57% of responding Newfoundland and Labradorians claim British or Irish ancestry, with 43.2% claiming at least one English parent, 21.5% at least one Irish parent, and 7% at least one parent of Scottish origin. Additionally 6.1% claimed at least one parent of French ancestry.[9] The island's total population as of the 2006 census was 479,105.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Long settled by indigenous peoples of the Dorset culture, the island was visited by the Icelandic Viking Leif Eriksson in the 11th century, who called the new land Vinland.[citation needed] The next European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. The island was visited by the Genoese navigator John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), working under contract to King Henry VII of England on his expedition from Bristol in 1497. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. (After European settlement, colonists first called the island Terra Nova, from New Land in Portuguese and Latin.)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Gilbert_plaque.jpg/150px-Gilbert_plaque.jpg" width="150" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Plaque commemorating Gilbert's founding of the British Empire</p><p>On August 5, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland as England's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I of England, thus officially establishing a fore-runner to the much later British Empire.[10] Newfoundland is considered Britain's oldest colony.[11] At the time of English settlement, the Beothuk inhabited the island.</p><p>While there is archaeological evidence of ancient indigenous peoples on the island, it was abandoned when the Norse arrived from Scandinavia.[citation needed] L'Anse aux Meadows was a Norse settlement near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland (Cape Norman), which has been dated to be approximately 1,000 years old. The site is considered the only undisputed evidence of Pre-Columbian contact between the Old and New Worlds, if the Norse-Inuit contact on Greenland is not counted. There is a second suspected Norse site in Point Rosee. The island is a likely location of Vinland, mentioned in the Viking Chronicles, although this has been disputed.</p><p>The indigenous people on the island at the time of European settlement were the Beothuk, who spoke an Amerindian language of the same name. Later immigrants developed a variety of dialects associated with settlement on the island: Newfoundland English, Newfoundland French.[citation needed] In the 19th century, it also had a dialect of Irish known as Newfoundland Irish.[citation needed] Scottish Gaelic was spoken on the island during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the Codroy Valley area, chiefly by settlers from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.[12] The Gaelic names reflected the association with fishing: in Scottish Gaelic, it was called Eilean a' Trosg, or literally, Island of the Cod.[13] Similarly, the Irish Gaelic name Talamh an Éisc means Land of the Fish.</p><h3>First inhabitants[edit]</h3><p>The first inhabitants of Newfoundland were the Paleo-Eskimo, who have no known link to other groups in Newfoundland history. Little is known about them beyond archeological evidence of early settlements. Evidence of successive cultures have been found. The Late Paleo-Eskimo, or Dorset culture, settled there about 4,000 years ago. They were descendants of migrations of ancient prehistoric peoples across the High Arctic thousands of years ago, after crossing from Siberia via the Bering land bridge. The Dorset died off or abandoned the island prior to the arrival of the Norse.[citation needed]</p><p>After this period, the Beothuk settled Newfoundland, migrating from Labrador on the mainland. There is no evidence that the Beothuk inhabited the island prior to Norse settlement. Scholars believe that the Beothuk are related closely to the Innu of Labrador.[citation needed] The tribe later became extinct although people of partial Beothuk descent have been documented[citation needed]. The name Beothuk means people in their own language which is a member of the Algonquian language family which itself is common to many Atlantic coastal tribes.</p><p>The tribe is now extinct but evidence of its culture is preserved in museum, historical and archaeological records. Shanawdithit, a woman who is often regarded as the last full-blood Beothuk, died in St. John's in 1829 of tuberculosis. However, Santu Toney, who was born around 1835 and died in 1910, was a woman of mixed Mi'kmaq and Beothuk descent which means that some Beothuk must have lived on beyond 1829. Her father was a Beothuk and mother a Mi'kmaq, both from Newfoundland. The Beothuk may have intermingled and assimilated with Innu in Labrador and Mi'kmaq in Newfoundland. Oral histories also suggest potential historical competition and hostility between the Beothuk and Mi'kmaq.[citation needed] The Mi'kmaq, Innu and Inuit all hunted and fished around Newfoundland before the arrival of Europeans but no evidence indicates that they lived on the island for long periods of time and would only travel to Newfoundland temporarily. Inuit have been documented on the Great Northern Peninsula as late as the 18th-Century. Newfoundland was historically the southernmost part of the Inuit's territorial range.</p><p>When Europeans arrived from 1497 and later, starting with John Cabot, they established contact with the Beothuk. Estimates of the number of Beothuk on the island at this time vary, ranging from 700 to 5,000.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Later both the English and French settled the island. They were followed by the Mi'kmaq, an Algonquian-speaking indigenous people from eastern Canada and present-day Nova Scotia. As European and Mi'kmaq settlement became year-round and expanded to new areas of the coast, the area available to the Beothuk to harvest the marine resources they relied upon was diminished. By the beginning of the 19th century, few Beothuk remained. Most died due to infectious diseases carried by Europeans, to which they had no immunity, and starvation. Government attempts to engage with the Beothuk and aid them came too late. The Beothuk were exceptionally hostile to foreigners, unlike the Mi'kmaq. The latter readily traded with Europeans and became established in settlements in Newfoundland.</p><h3>European contact, colonisation and settlement[edit]</h3><p>Main article: History of Newfoundland and Labrador</p><p>Newfoundland is the site of the only authenticated Norse (mostly Greenlandic Icelanders) settlement in North America. This archeological site was discovered by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, at L'Anse aux Meadows in 1960. The site has been the subject of multi-year archaeological digs in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>These have revealed that the settlement dated to more than 500 years before John Cabot; it contains the earliest-known European structures in North America. Designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO, it is believed to be the Vinland settlement of explorer Leif Eiriksson. (The Icelandic Skálholt Vinland Map of 1570 refers to the area as Promontorium Winlandiæ and correctly shows it on a 51°N parallel with Bristol, England). The Norse stayed for a relatively short period of time, believed to be between 999 and 1001 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Cabot_tower.jpg/250px-Cabot_tower.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>Cabot Tower located in St John's</p><p>After the departure of the Norse, the island was inhabited by aboriginal populations for nearly 500 years. In 1497, the Italian navigator John Cabot (Zuan/Giovanni Cabotto) became the first European since the Norse settlers to set foot on Newfoundland, working under commission of King Henry VII of England. His landing site is unknown but popularly believed to be Cape Bonavista, along the island's East coast.,[14] Another site claimed is Cape Bauld, at the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula. A document found in the Spanish National Archives, written by a Bristol merchant, reports that Cabot's crew landed 1,800 miles (2,900&nbsp;km) west of Dursey Head, Ireland (latitude 51° 35'N), which would put Cabot within sight of Cape Bauld. This document mentions an island that Cabot sailed past to go ashore on the mainland. This description fits with the Cape Bauld theory, as Belle Isle is not far offshore.[14]</p><p>After Cabot, the first European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Late in the 17th century came Irish fishermen, who named the island Talamh an Éisc, meaning land of the fish, or the fishing grounds in Irish Gaelic. This reflected the abundance of fisheries.</p><p>In 1583, when Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally claimed Newfoundland as a colony of England, he found numerous English, French and Portuguese vessels at St. John's. There was no permanent population. Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, and plans of settlement were postponed.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>On July 5, 1610, John Guy set sail from Bristol, England with 39 other colonists for Cuper's Cove. This, and other early attempts at permanent settlement failed to make a profit for the English investors, but some settlers remained, forming the very earliest modern European population on the island. By 1620, the fishermen of England's West Country dominated the east coast of Newfoundland. French fishermen dominated the island's south coast and Northern Peninsula.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg/250px-Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg" width="250" height="244"><br><p>James Cook's 1775 Chart of Newfoundland</p><p>After 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, the French ceded control of south and north shores of the island to the British. They kept only the nearby islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, located in the fish-rich Grand Banks off the south coast. Despite some early settlements by the English, the Crown discouraged permanent, year-round settlement of Newfoundland by migratory fishery workers. Thomas Nash was an Irish Catholic fisherman who permanently settled in Newfoundland despite English rule. He established the fishing town of Branch.[15] He and his cousin Father Patrick Power of Callan, County Kilkenny, spread Catholicism in Newfoundland. This settlement attracted a major migration of Irish Catholic immigrants to Newfoundland in the early eighteenth century.[16]</p><p>By the late 18th century, permanent settlement increased, peaking in the early years of the 19th century.[17]</p><p>The French name for the island is Terre Neuve. The name Newfoundland' is one of the oldest European place names in Canada in continuous geographical and cartographical use, dating from a 1502 letter. It was stated in the following 1628 poem:</p><p>A Skeltonicall continued ryme, in praise of my New-found-Land</p><p>Although in cloaths, company, buildings faire
With England, New-found-land cannot compare:
Did some know what contentment I found there,
Alwayes enough, most times somewhat to spare,
With little paines, lesse toyle, and lesser care,
Exempt from taxings, ill newes, Lawing, feare,
If cleane, and warme, no matter what you weare,
Healthy, and wealthy, if men careful are,
With much-much more, then I will now declare,
(I say) if some wise men knew what this were
(I doe beleeue) they'd live no other where.

It was also different from those other immigrants would build on the North American mainland. As a fish-exporting society, Newfoundland was in contact with many ports and societies around the Atlantic rim. But its geographic location and political distinctiveness isolated it from its closest neighbours, Canada and the United States. Internally, most of its population was spread widely around a rugged coastline in small outport settlements. Many were distant from larger centres of population and isolated for long periods by winter ice or bad weather. These conditions had an effect on the cultures of the immigrants. They generated new ways of thinking and acting. Newfoundland and Labrador developed a wide variety of distinctive customs, beliefs, stories, songs and dialects.</p><p>The First World War had a powerful and lasting effect on the society. From a population of about a quarter of a million, 5,482 men went overseas. Nearly 1,500 were killed and 2,300 wounded. On July 1, 1916, at Beaumont-Hamel, France, 753 men of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment went over the top of a trench. The next morning, only 68 men answered the roll-call. Even now, when the rest of Canada celebrates the founding of the country on July 1, many Newfoundlanders take part in solemn ceremonies of remembrance.</p><p>The Second World War also had a lasting effect on Newfoundland. In particular, the United States assigned forces to the military bases at Argentia, Gander, Stephenville, Goose Bay and St. John's.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg/250px-Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg" width="250" height="192"><br><p>Joseph Smallwood signing the document bringing Newfoundland into Confederation.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador is the youngest province in Canada. Newfoundland was organised as a colony in 1825, was self-governing from 1855–1934, and held dominion status from 1907–1949 (see Dominion of Newfoundland). In late 1948, the population of the colony voted 52.3% to 47.7%[18] in favour of joining Canada as a province. Opposition was concentrated among residents of the capital St. John's, and on the Avalon Peninsula.</p><p>Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949. Union with Canada has done little to reduce Newfoundlanders' self-image as a unique group. In 2003, 72% of residents responding identified first as Newfoundlanders, secondarily as Canadians.[19] Separatist sentiment is low, though, less than 12% in the same 2003 study.</p><p>The referendum campaign of 1948 was bitterly fought, and interests in both Canada and Britain favoured and supported confederation with Canada. Jack Pickersgill, a western Canadian native and politician, worked with the confederation camp during the campaign. The Catholic Church, whose members were a minority on the island, lobbied for continued independence. Canada offered financial incentives, including a baby bonus for each child in a family. The Confederates were led by the charismatic Joseph Smallwood, a former radio broadcaster, who had developed socialist political inclinations while working for a socialist newspaper in New York City. His policies as premier were closer to liberalism than socialism.</p><p>Following confederation, Smallwood led Newfoundland for decades as the elected premier. He was said to have a cult of personality among his many supporters. Some residents featured photographs of Joey in their living rooms in a place of prominence.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Flags of Newfoundland[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign%2C_1870%E2%80%931904.svg/175px-Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign%2C_1870%E2%80%931904.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Newfoundland Blue Ensign, Newfoundland's colonial government flag from 1870 to 1904</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign.png/175px-Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The "updated" Newfoundland Blue Ensign, government ensign from 1904 to 1965</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Red_Ensign.svg/175px-Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Red_Ensign.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Newfoundland Red Ensign, Newfoundland's civil ensign from 1904 to 1965</p><p>The first flag to specifically represent Newfoundland is thought to have been an image of a green fir tree on a pink background that was in use in the early 19th century.[20] The first official flag identifying Newfoundland, flown by vessels in service of the colonial government, was the Newfoundland Blue Ensign, adopted in 1870 and used until 1904, when it was modified slightly. In 1904, the crown of the Blue Ensign was replaced with the Great Seal of Newfoundland (having been given royal approval in 1827) and the British Parliament designated Newfoundland Red and Blue ensigns as official flags specifically for Newfoundland. The Red and Blue ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were used officially from 1904 until 1965, with the Red Ensign being flown as civil ensign by merchant shipping, and the Blue being flown by governmental ships (after the British tradition of having different flags for merchant/naval and government vessel identification).</p><p>On September 26, 1907, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom declared the Colony of Newfoundland, as an independent Dominion within the British Empire,[21] and from that point until 1965, the Newfoundland Red Ensign was used as the civil ensign of the Dominion of Newfoundland with the Blue Ensign, again, reserved for government shipping identification.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Central America (Spanish: América Central or Centroamérica) is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)[2] and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America—except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama—was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, though, people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state (e.g. it is still common to write C.A. after the country names, in formal and informal contexts).</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Different definitions[edit]</h2><p>Central America may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Central America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg/220px-1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg" width="220" height="300"><br><p>Central America, 1798</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG/220px-Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG" width="220" height="293"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Tikal, Guatemala.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Tazumal_10.jpg/220px-Tazumal_10.jpg" width="220" height="149"><br><p>Tazumal, El Salvador.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg/220px-CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg" width="220" height="155"><br><p>Copan, Honduras.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg/220px-Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>Altun Ha, Belize.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg/220px-Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Stone spheres of Costa Rica.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg/220px-HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg" width="220" height="157"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Ancient footprints of Acahualinca, Nicaragua.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some[11] culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.</p><p>Following Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.[citation needed]</p><p>In 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.</p><p>The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.</p><p>From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.[citation needed]</p><p>The Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.[citation needed]</p><p>The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506–1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.[citation needed]</p><p>Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation.

The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America,[7] while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Isthmus of Panama, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.</p><p>Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At 4,220 meters (13,850&nbsp;ft), Volcán Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:</p><p>High points in Central America</p><p>Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.[14]</p><p>Trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.[15]</p><h2>Biodiversity[edit]</h2><p>See also: Central America bioregion</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg/220px-El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg" width="220" height="296"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>El Chorreron in El Salvador</p><p>Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.[16] The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropic ecozones. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.[16] The table below shows recent statistics:</p><p>Biodiversity in Central America (number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants)</p><p>Over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.[24]</p><p>Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.[25] A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species. So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.[26]</p><h3>Flora[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg/220px-Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>One of the hanging bridges of the skywalk at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Monteverde, Costa Rica disappearing into the clouds</p><p>From 2001 to 2010, 5,376 square kilometers (2,076&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers (4,711&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers (1,830&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers (793&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers (3,310&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers (1,180&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.[27]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers (43,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[28] extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between 600–1,800 metres (2,000–5,900&nbsp;ft) elevation,[28] and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above 1,800 metres (5,900&nbsp;ft) are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.</p><p>Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1,000 meters (3,300&nbsp;ft) above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia.[29] The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.</p><p>The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund.[30] These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800–4,000 metres (5,900–13,100&nbsp;ft), on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers (5,100&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.[30]</p><h3>Fauna[edit]</h3><p>See also: List of Central American mammals and List of Central American monkey species</p><p>Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America.[29] The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Tectonic_plates_Caribbean.png/220px-Tectonic_plates_Caribbean.png" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Central America and the Caribbean Plate

Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.</p><p>Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some 60–160 kilometers (37–99&nbsp;mi) off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.[31] For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.</p><p>The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.</p><p>Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly 80 kilometers (50&nbsp;mi) to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.[32]</p><p>Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.</p><p>Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>See also: Ethnic groups in Central America and Latin Americans</p><p>The population of Central America is estimated at 42,688,190 as of 2012.[3] With an area of 523,780 square kilometers (202,230&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[2] it has a population density of 81 per square kilometer (210/sq&nbsp;mi).</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png/220px-Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png" width="220" height="146"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Linguistic variations of classic Central American Spanish.

Main article: Central American Parliament</p><p>The Central American Parliament (also known as PARLACEN) is a political and parliamentary body of SICA. The parliament's beginnings started at around 1980, and its primary goal was to solve wars in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Economy[edit]</h2><p>See also: Economy of Belize, Economy of Costa Rica, Economy of El Salvador, Economy of Guatemala, Economy of Honduras, Economy of Nicaragua, and Economy of Panama</p><p>Signed in 2004, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.

				This article is about the British city. For other uses, see Bristol (disambiguation).</p><p>Bristol (/'br?st?l/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) is a city and county[4] in South West England with a population of 454,200[5] in 2017. The district has the 10th largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.</p><p>Iron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English the place at the bridge). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham in the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the U.K.- the Bristol pound, which is pegged to the Pound sterling. The city has two universities, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England, and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the Royal West of England Academy, the Arnolfini, Spike Island, Ashton Gate and the Memorial Stadium. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road, rail, sea and air by the M5 and M4 (which connect to the city centre by the Portway and M32), Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway mainline rail stations, and Bristol Airport.</p><p>One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness series of travel guides. The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the EU's European Green Capital Award in 2015.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>The most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge.[6] It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer.[7] Alternative etymologies are supported with the numerous orthographic variations in Medieval documents with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.[8]</p><p>The Old English form Brycgstow is commonly used to derive the meaning place at the bridge.[9] Utilizing another form, Brastuile, Rev. Dr. Shaw derived the name from the Celtic words bras (quick, rapid), or braos (a gap, chasm,) and tuile (a stream). The poet Thomas Chatterton popularised a derivation from Brictricstow linking the town to Brictric, the last king of Wessex. It appears that the form Bricstow prevailed until 1204,[10] and the Bristolian 'L' (the tendency for the local accent to add a letter L to the end of some words) is what eventually changed the name to Bristol.[11]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: History of Bristol and Timeline of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Fifteenth-century pictorial map of Bristol, radiating from the town centre" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png/220px-Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png" width="220" height="345"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Robert Ricart's map of Bristol, drawn when he became common clerk of the town in 1478.

Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.[16]</p><h3>Middle Ages[edit]</h3><p>Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name.[17] By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons.[17] Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England.[18] Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.[19]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg/220px-Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Black and white etching showing the towers of St Stephen's Church, St Augustine the Less Church and Bristol Cathedral, published c.1850</p><p>The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls.[20] By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s.[21] The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373,[22] the first town in England to be given this status.[23][24][25] During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre.[26] By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London.[27] One-third to one-half the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49,[28] which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.[29]</p><h3>15th and 16th centuries[edit]</h3><p>During the 15th century Bristol was the second most important port in the country, trading with Ireland,[30] Iceland[31] and Gascony.[26] It was the starting point for many voyages, including Robert Sturmy's (1457–58) unsuccessful attempt to break the Italian monopoly of Eastern Mediterranean trade.[32] New exploration voyages were launched by Venetian John Cabot, who in 1497 made landfall in North America.[33] A 1499 voyage, led by merchant William Weston of Bristol, was the first expedition commanded by an Englishman to North America.[34] During the first decade of the 16th century Bristol's merchants undertook a series of exploration voyages to North America and even founded a commercial organisation, 'The Company Adventurers to the New Found Land', to assist their endeavours.[35] However, they seem to have lost interest in North America after 1509, having incurred great expenses and made little profit.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>During the 16th century, Bristol merchants concentrated on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies.[36] This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, such as food and guns, to Iberia[37] during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604).[38] Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.[39]</p><br><img alt="A stone built Victorian Gothic building with two square towers and a central arched entrance underneath a circular ornate window.

Bristol also gained city status that year.[42] During the English Civil War in the 1640s the city was occupied by Royalists, who built the Royal Fort House on the site of an earlier Parliamentarian stronghold.[43]</p><h3>17th and 18th centuries[edit]</h3><p>Growth of the city and trade came with the rise of England's American colonies in the 17th century. Bristol's location on the west side of Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made the most of it. The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery to the Americas. Bristol and Liverpool became centres of the Triangular Trade. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the Middle Passage under brutal conditions.[44] In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic.[44] Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The Somersett Case of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England.[45] At the height of the Bristol slave trade from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas.[46] The Seven Stars public house,[47] where abolitionist Thomas Clarkson collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.[48]</p><br><img alt=" An engraving showing at the top a sailing ship and paddle steamer in a harbour, with sheds and a church spire.

Because of Bristol's nautical environment, maritime safety was an important issue in the city. During the 19th century, Samuel Plimsoll, known as the sailor's friend, campaigned to make the seas safer; shocked by overloaded vessels, he successfully fought for a compulsory load line on ships.[50]</p><p>In 1739 John Wesley founded the first Methodist chapel, the New Room, in Bristol.[51] Wesley, along with his brother Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, preached to large congregations in Bristol and the neighbouring village of Kingswood, often in the open air.[52][53]</p><h3>19th century[edit]</h3><p>The city was associated with Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway between Bristol and London Paddington, two pioneering Bristol-built oceangoing steamships (SS&nbsp;Great Britain and SS&nbsp;Great Western), and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The new railway replaced the Kennet and Avon Canal, which had fully opened in 1810 as the main route for the transport of goods between Bristol and London.[54] Competition from Liverpool (beginning around 1760), disruptions of maritime commerce due to war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to Bristol's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of Northern England and the West Midlands. The tidal Avon Gorge, which had secured the port during the Middle Ages, had become a liability. An 1804–09 plan to improve the city's port with a floating harbour designed by William Jessop was a costly error, requiring high harbour fees.[55]</p><p>By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over 300 feet (90&nbsp;m) from reaching the harbour, resulting in falling trade.[56] The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.[57] Some of the traditional industries including copper and brass manufacture went into decline,[58] but the import and processing of tobacco flourished with the expansion of the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills business.[59]</p><p>Supported by new industry and growing commerce, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801), quintupled during the 19th century,[60] resulting in the creation of new suburbs such as Clifton and Cotham. These provide architectural examples from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and at right angles to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic medieval gothic style appeared, partially as a reaction against the symmetry of Palladianism, and can be seen in buildings such as the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery,[61] the Royal West of England Academy,[62] and The Victoria Rooms.[63] Riots broke out in 1793[64] and 1831; the first over the renewal of tolls on Bristol Bridge, and the second against the rejection of the second Reform Bill by the House of Lords.[65] The Diocese of Bristol had undergone several boundary changes by 1897 when it was reconstituted into the configuration which has lasted into the 21st century.[66]</p><br><img alt="An old ordnance survey map of Bristol, showing roads, railways, rivers and contours." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Bristol_map_1946.jpg/220px-Bristol_map_1946.jpg" width="220" height="204"><br><p>A 1946 map of Bristol</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>20th century[edit]</h3><p>From a population of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971.[67] Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock.[68] Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s.[69] As air travel grew in the first half of the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories.[70]</p><p>Bristol was heavily damaged by Luftwaffe raids during World War II; about 1,300 people living or working in the city were killed and nearly 100,000 buildings were damaged, at least 3,000 beyond repair.[71][72] The original central market area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed churches and fragments of the castle. A third bomb-damaged church nearby, St Nicholas, has been restored and is a museum housing a 1756 William Hogarth triptych painted for the high altar of St Mary Redcliffe. The museum also has statues of King Edward I (moved from Arno's Court Triumphal Arch) and King Edward III (taken from Lawfords' Gate in the city walls when they were demolished about 1760), and 13th-century statues of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (builder of Bristol Castle)[73] and Geoffrey de Montbray (who built the city's walls) from Bristol's Newgate.[74]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg/220px-Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Ambrose Road, in the Cliftonwood neighbourhood</p><p>The rebuilding of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead shopping area regenerated, and one of the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished.[75] Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).[76]</p><p>The 20th century relocation of the docks to Avonmouth Docks and Royal Portbury Dock, 7 miles (11&nbsp;km) downstream from the city centre, has allowed the redevelopment of the old dock area (the Floating Harbour).[77] Although the docks' existence was once in jeopardy (since the area was seen as a derelict industrial site), the inaugural 1996 International Festival of the Sea held in and around the docks affirmed the area as a leisure asset of the city.[78]</p><h2>Government[edit]</h2><br><img alt="A large brick building, built in a shallow curve, with a central porch.

Main article: Politics of Bristol</p><p>Bristol City council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards,[79] with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held in three years out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election.[80] Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong in the city and (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.[81]</p><p>In February 2009, the Labour group resigned and the Liberal Democrats took office with a minority administration.[82] In the 4 June 2009 council elections the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council.[83] In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6.[84] In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which a third of the city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7&nbsp;seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2&nbsp;to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.[85]</p><p>These trends were continued into the next election in May 2014, in which Labour gained three seats to take their total to 31, the Green Party won two more seats, the Conservative party gained one seat, and UKIP won their first-ever seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats lost a further seven seats.[86]</p><p>On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a referendum on the question of a directly elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a directly elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012, and Independent candidate George Ferguson became Mayor of Bristol.[87]</p><p>The Lord Mayor of Bristol, not to be confused with the Mayor of Bristol, is a figurehead elected each May by the city council. Councillor Faruk Choudhury was selected by his fellow councillors for the position in 2013. At 38, he was the youngest person to serve as Lord Mayor of Bristol and the first Muslim elected to the office.[88]</p><p>Bristol constituencies in the House of Commons also included parts of other local authority areas until the 2010 general election, when their boundaries were aligned with the county boundary. The city is divided into Bristol West, East, South and North West.[89] Since the 2015 election, the city has had three Labour members of parliament (MPs) and one Conservative.[90]</p><p>The city has a tradition of political activism. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that he was a member of parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second.[91][92] Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol,[93] and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83.[94] In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act.[95] The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the social and economic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of fair trade was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.[96]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol is both a city and a county, since Edward III granted it a county charter in 1373.[22] The county was expanded in 1835 to include suburbs such as Clifton, and it was named a county borough in 1889 when that designation was introduced.[24] On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon.[97] The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.[98]</p><h2>Geography and environment[edit]</h2><h3>Boundaries[edit]</h3><p>See also: Subdivisions of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Suspension bridge between two brick built towers, over a wooded gorge, showing mud and water at the bottom.

The narrowest definition of the city is the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.[99]</p><p>A slightly broader definition used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol but outside the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary.[100] The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano.[101] The North Fringe of Bristol, a developed area in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named as part of a 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.[102]</p><h3>Greater Bristol[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Greater Bristol</p><p>The term Greater Bristol, used by the Government Office of the South West (now abolished), the Office for National Statistics and others,[103] refers to the city and portions of the three neighbouring local authorities?—?Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire?—?an area sometimes called the former Avon area or the West of England Partnership (WEP) area. Greater Bristol does not include Bath or Weston-super-Mare, which are included in the WEP area.[104] The Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways (FOSBR) conflates the terms Greater Bristol and Suburban Bristol.[105]</p><br><img alt="Rocky side to a gorge with a platform in front of a cave halfway up.

The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.[107]</p><p>The gorge, which helped protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone to build the city, and its surrounding land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.[107]</p><h3>Climate[edit]</h3><p>Located in southern England, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK with a mean annual temperature of approximately 10.5&nbsp;°C (50.9&nbsp;°F).[108][109] It is among the sunniest, with 1,541–1,885&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.[110] Although the city is partially sheltered by the Mendip Hills, it is exposed to the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel. Annual rainfall increases from north to south, with totals north of the Avon in the 600–900&nbsp;mm (24–35&nbsp;in) range and 900–1,200&nbsp;mm (35–47&nbsp;in) south of the river.[111] Rain is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with autumn and winter the wetter seasons. The Atlantic Ocean influences Bristol's weather, keeping its average temperature above freezing throughout the year, but winter frosts are frequent and snow occasionally falls from early November to late April. Summers are warm and drier, with variable sunshine, rain and clouds, and spring weather is unsettled.[112]</p><p>The weather stations nearest Bristol for which long-term climate data are available are Long Ashton (about 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) south west of the city centre) and Bristol Weather Station, in the city centre. Data collection at these locations ended in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and Filton Airfield is currently the nearest weather station to the city.[113] Temperatures at Long Ashton from 1959 to 2002 ranged from 33.5&nbsp;°C (92.3&nbsp;°F) in July 1976[114] to -14.4&nbsp;°C (6.1&nbsp;°F) in January 1982.[115] Monthly high temperatures since 2002 at Filton exceeding those recorded at Long Ashton include 25.7&nbsp;°C (78.3&nbsp;°F) in April 2003,[116] 34.5&nbsp;°C (94.1&nbsp;°F) in July 2006[117] and 26.8&nbsp;°C (80.2&nbsp;°F) in October 2011.[118] The lowest recent temperature at Filton was -10.1&nbsp;°C (13.8&nbsp;°F) in December 2010.[119] Although large cities in general experience an urban heat island effect, with warmer temperatures than their surrounding rural areas, this phenomenon is minimal in Bristol.[120]</p><h3>Environment[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Environment in Bristol</p><p>Bristol was ranked as Britain's most-sustainable city (based on its environmental performance, quality of life, future-proofing and approaches to climate change, recycling and biodiversity), topping environmental charity Forum for the Future's 2008 Sustainable Cities Index.[123][124] Local initiatives include Sustrans (creators of the National Cycle Network, founded as Cyclebag in 1977)[125] and Resourcesaver, a non-profit business established in 1988 by Avon Friends of the Earth.[126] In 2014 The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live.[127] The city received the 2015 European Green Capital Award, becoming the first UK city to receive this award.[128]</p><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Demography of Bristol</p><p>In 2014, the Office for National Statistics estimated the Bristol unitary authority's population at 442,474,[133][134] making it the 43rd-largest ceremonial county in England.[134] The ONS, using Census 2001 data, estimated the city's population at 441,556[135] and that of the contiguous urban area at 551,066.[136] In 2006 the ONS estimated Bristol's urban-area population at 587,400,[137] making it England's sixth-most-populous city and ninth-most-populous urban area.[136] At 3,599 inhabitants per square kilometre (9,321/sq&nbsp;mi) it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district.[138]</p><p>According to the 2011 census, 84% of the population was White (77.9% White British, 0.9% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Travellers and 5.1% Other White); 3.6% mixed-race (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% Asian (1.5% Indian, 1.6% Pakistani, 0.5% Bangladeshi, 0.9% Chinese and one percent other Asian); 6% Black (2.8% African, 1.6% Caribbean, 1.6% Other Black), 0.3% Arab and 0.6% with other heritage. Bristol is unusual among major British towns and cities in its larger black than Asian population.[139] These statistics apply to the Bristol Unitary Authority area, excluding areas of the urban area (2006 estimated population 587,400) in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) and North Somerset—such as Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Filton and Warmley.[67] 56.2% of the 209,995 Bristol Residents who are employed commute to work using either a car, van, motorbike or Taxi. While 2.2% commute by rail and 9.8% by bus, 19.6% walk.[140]</p><h2>Economy and industry[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Economy of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Two ornate metal pillars with large dishes on top in a paved street, with an eighteenth-century stone building behind, upon which can be seen the words &quot;Tea Blenders Estabklishec 177-&quot;.

Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products.[142] Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.[143][144]</p><p>Ships occasionally departed Bristol for Iceland as early as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot.[20] Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities.[20] In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.[145]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>By 1670 the city had 6,000&nbsp;tons of shipping (of which half was imported tobacco), and by the late 17th and early 18th centuries shipping played a significant role in the slave trade.[20] During the 18th century, Bristol was Britain's second-busiest port;[146] business was conducted in the trading area around The Exchange in Corn Street over bronze tables known as Nails. Although the Nails are cited as originating the phrase cash on the nail (immediate payment), the phrase was probably in use before their installation.[147]</p><p>The city's economy also relies on the aerospace, defence, media, information technology, financial services and tourism industries.[148][149] The Ministry of Defence (MoD)'s Procurement Executive, later known as the Defence Procurement Agency and Defence Equipment and Support, moved to its headquarters to Abbey Wood, Filton, in 1995. This organisation, with a staff of 7,000 to 8,000, procures and supports MoD equipment.[150] One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top-ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness guides for young adults.[151]</p><p>Bristol is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group, and is ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, the fourth highest ranked English city.[152] In 2014 Bristol's gross domestic product was £30.502&nbsp;billion.[153][154] Its per capita GDP was £46,000 ($65,106, €57,794), which was some 65% above the national average, the third highest of any English city (after London and Nottingham) and the sixth highest of any city in the United Kingdom (behind London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Nottingham).[153] Bristol's March 2007 unemployment rate was 4.8%, compared with four percent for South West England and the national average of 5.5%.[155]</p><p>Although Bristol's economy no longer relies upon its port, which was moved to docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s[156] and to the Royal Portbury Dock in 1977 as ship size increased, it is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330&nbsp;million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9&nbsp;million long tons (4&nbsp;million tonnes) to 11.8&nbsp;million (12&nbsp;million).[157] Tobacco importing and cigarette manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.[158]</p><p>The financial services sector employs 59,000 in the city,[159] and 50 micro-electronics and silicon design companies employ about 5,000. In 1983 Hewlett-Packard opened its national research laboratory in Bristol.[160][161] In 2014 the city was ranked seventh in the top 10 UK destinations by TripAdvisor.[162]</p><p>During the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at Filton by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later Rolls-Royce) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I Bristol Fighter[163] and World War II Blenheim and Beaufighter planes.[163] During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the Freighter, Britannia and Brabazon. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, luxury Bristol Cars at their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960.[164] The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.[165]</p><br><img alt="A view from below of an aeroplane in flight, with a slender fuselage and swept back wings." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg/220px-Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="157"><br><p>Final Concorde flight on 26 November 2003, shortly before landing on the Filton runway.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>The climate of the area is tropical to subtropical in Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Rainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents (cool upwellings keep the ABC islands arid). Warm, moist trade winds blow consistently from the east creating rain forest /semi desert divisions on mountainous islands. Occasional north westerlies affect the northern islands in the winter.

See also: Caribbean South America and Caribbean basin</p><h3>Continental countries with Caribbean coastlines and islands[edit]</h3><h2>Biodiversity[edit]</h2><p>The Caribbean islands are remarkable for the diversity of their animals, fungi and plants, and have been classified as one of Conservation International's biodiversity hotspots because of their exceptionally diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems, ranging from montane cloud forests to cactus scrublands. The region also contains about 8% (by surface area) of the world's coral reefs[25] along with extensive seagrass meadows,[26] both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering the island and continental coasts of the region.</p><p>For the fungi, there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90,000 records derived from specimens in reference collections, published accounts and field observations.[27] That checklist includes more than 11250 species of fungi recorded from the region. As its authors note, the work is far from exhaustive, and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the Caribbean is higher. The true total number of fungal species occurring in the Caribbean, including species not yet recorded, is likely far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have been discovered.[28] Though the amount of available information is still small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to some Caribbean islands. For Cuba, 2200 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the island;[29] for Puerto Rico, the number is 789 species;[30] for the Dominican Republic, the number is 699 species;[31] for Trinidad and Tobago, the number is 407 species.[32]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Many of the ecosystems of the Caribbean islands have been devastated by deforestation, pollution, and human encroachment. The arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of giant owls and dwarf ground sloths.[33] The hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals (ranging from birds, to mammals and reptiles), fungi and plants. Examples of threatened animals include the Puerto Rican amazon, two species of solenodon (giant shrews) in Cuba and the Hispaniola island, and the Cuban crocodile.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Isla_Saona.jpg/750px-Isla_Saona.jpg" width="750" height="159"><p>Saona Island, Dominican Republic</p><p>The region's coral reefs, which contain about 70 species of hard corals and between 500–700 species of reef-associated fishes[34] have undergone rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in recent years, and are considered particularly vulnerable to global warming and ocean acidification.[35] According to a UNEP report, the Caribbean coral reefs might get extinct in next 20 years due to population explosion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas and global warming.[36]</p><p>Some Caribbean islands have terrain that Europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture. Tobacco was an important early crop during the colonial era, but was eventually overtaken by sugarcane production as the region's staple crop. Sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to Europe. Cuba and Barbados were historically the largest producers of sugar. The tropical plantation system thus came to dominate Caribbean settlement. Other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for agriculture, for example Dominica, which remains heavily forested. The islands in the southern Lesser Antilles, Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, are extremely arid, making them unsuitable for agriculture. However, they have salt pans that were exploited by the Dutch. Sea water was pumped into shallow ponds, producing coarse salt when the water evaporated.[37]</p><p>The natural environmental diversity of the Caribbean islands has led to recent growth in eco-tourism. This type of tourism is growing on islands lacking sandy beaches and dense human populations.[38]</p><h3>Plants and animals[edit]</h3><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Agostino_Brunias_-_Linen_Market%2C_Dominica_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Agostino_Brunias_-_Linen_Market%2C_Dominica_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="159"><br><p>A linen market in Dominica in the 1770s</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Agostino_Brunias._Free_Women_of_Color_with_Their_Children_and_Servants_in_a_Landscape%2C_ca._1770-1796.jpg/220px-Agostino_Brunias._Free_Women_of_Color_with_Their_Children_and_Servants_in_a_Landscape%2C_ca._1770-1796.jpg" width="220" height="173"><br><p>Agostino Brunias.

The population of the Caribbean is estimated to have been around 750,000 immediately before European contact, although lower and higher figures are given. After contact, social disruption and epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles (to which they had no natural immunity)[39] led to a decline in the Amerindian population.[40] From 1500 to 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from West Africa[41] such as the Kongo, Igbo, Akan, Fon and Yoruba as well as military prisoners from Ireland, who were deported during the Cromwellian reign in England.[citation needed] Immigrants from Britain, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark also arrived, although the mortality rate was high for both groups.[42]</p><p>The population is estimated to have reached 2.2 million by 1800.[43] Immigrants from India, China, Indonesia, and other countries arrived in the mid-19th century as indentured servants.[44] After the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, the population increased naturally.[45] The total regional population was estimated at 37.5 million by 2000.[46]</p><p>The majority of the Caribbean has populations of mainly Africans in the French Caribbean, Anglophone Caribbean and Dutch Caribbean, there are minorities of mixed-race (including Mulatto-Creole, Dougla, Mestizo, Quadroon, Cholo, Castizo, Criollo, Zambo, Pardo, Asian Latin Americans, Chindian, Cocoa panyols, and Eurasian); and European people of Spanish, Dutch, English, French, Italian, and Portuguese ancestry. Asians, especially those of Chinese, Indian descent, and Javenese Indonesians, form a significant minority in the region and also contribute to multiracial communities. Indians form a majority of the population in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname.

This is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured laborers, and migration. Most multi-racial Jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or brown. Similar populations can be found in the Caricom states of Belize, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago has a multi-racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrivals of Africans, Indians, Chinese, Arabs, Jews, Spanish, Portuguese, and Europeans along with the Native Amerindians population. This multi-racial mix has created sub-ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include Dougla, Chindian, Mulatto-Creole, Afro-Asians, Eurasian, Cocoa panyols, and Asian Latin Americans</p><h3>Indigenous groups[edit]</h3><h3>Language[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Languages of the Caribbean</p><p>Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Haitian Creole, Antillean Creole French, and Papiamento are the predominant official languages of various countries in the region, though a handful of unique creole languages or dialects can also be found from one country to another.

Regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems. From a political and economic perspective, regionalism serves to make Caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions. In 1973, the first political regionalism in the Caribbean Basin was created by advances of the English-speaking Caribbean nations through the institution known as the Caribbean Common Market and Community (CARICOM)[49] which is located in Guyana.</p><p>Certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the Caribbean. On the one hand the Caribbean states are politically diverse, ranging from communist systems such as Cuba toward more capitalist Westminster-style parliamentary systems as in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other scholars argue that these differences are superficial, and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various Caribbean states. Contemporary Caribbean systems seem to reflect a blending of traditional and modern patterns, yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways.[50] The political systems of the Caribbean states share similar practices.</p><p>The influence of regionalism in the Caribbean is often marginalized. Some scholars believe that regionalism cannot exist in the Caribbean because each small state is unique. On the other hand, scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the Caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists. Proximity as well as historical ties among the Caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action.[51] These attempts at regionalization reflect the nations' desires to compete in the international economic system.[51]</p><p>Furthermore, a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region. In recent years the Caribbean has suffered from a lack of U.S. interest. With the end of the Cold War, U.S. security and economic interests have been focused on other areas. As a result there has been a significant reduction in U.S. aid and investment to the Caribbean.[52] The lack of international support for these small, relatively poor states, helped regionalism prosper.</p><p>Following the Cold War another issue of importance in the Caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some Caribbean States due to the United States and European Union's allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other. [clarification needed]</p><p>United States effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The United States under President Bill Clinton launched a challenge in the World Trade Organization against the EU over Europe's preferential program, known as the Lomé Convention, which allowed banana exports from the former colonies of the Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) to enter Europe cheaply.[53] The World Trade Organization sided in the United States' favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to African, Caribbean and Pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the Cotonou Agreement.[54]</p><p>During the US/EU dispute, the United States imposed large tariffs on European Union goods (up to 100%) to pressure Europe to change the agreement with the Caribbean nations in favour of the Cotonou Agreement.[55]</p><p>Farmers in the Caribbean have complained of falling profits and rising costs as the Lomé Convention weakens. Some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of illegal drugs, which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these illegal drugs in North America and Europe.[56][57]</p><p>Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and Association of Caribbean States[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry. One of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the Caribbean Basin has been the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Proposed by CARICOM in 1992, the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region. It was founded in July 1994. The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues unique to the Caribbean Basin. Through coalition building, like the ACS and CARICOM, regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean. The successes of region-building initiatives are still debated by scholars, yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean.</p><p>Venezuela's effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez launched an economic group called the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), which several eastern Caribbean islands joined. In 2012, the nation of Haiti, with 9 million people, became the largest CARICOM nation that sought to join the union.[58]</p><h2>Regional institutions[edit]</h2><p>Here are some of the bodies that several islands share in collaboration:</p><h2>Cuisine[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Caribbean cuisine</p><h3>Favorite or national dishes[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg/220px-FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Doubles, one of the national dishes of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Arroz_con_gandules.jpg/220px-Arroz_con_gandules.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Arroz con gandules, one of the national dishes of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Geography:</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Find more aboutCaribbeanat Wikipedia's sister projects</p><p>Coordinates: 14°31'32?N 75°49'06?W? / ?14.52556°N 75.81833°W? / 14.52556; -75.81833</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

The term Amerindian (short for 'Indians of the Americas) is used in Quebec, the Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean.[24][25][26][27] In Brazil, indígenas or povos indígenas are common if formal-sounding designations, while índio is still the more often-heard term (the noun for the Indian nationality being indiano), and aborígene and nativo being rarely used in Amerindian-specific contexts (e.g. aborígene is usually understood as the ethnonym for Indigenous Australians). Indigenous peoples are commonly known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples, which includes not only First Nations and Arctic Inuit, but also the minority population of First Nations-European mixed-race Métis people[28] who identify culturally and ethnically with indigenous peoplehood. This is contrasted, for instance, to the American Indian-European mixed-race mestizos of Hispanic America (caboclos in Brazil) who, with their larger population (in most Latin American countries constituting either outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities), identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both Europeans and Indigenous Americans, but still considering themselves a subset of the European-derived Hispanic or Brazilian peoplehood in culture and ethnicity (cf. ladinos).</p><p>Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians, and Alaska Natives.[29]</p><p>Application of the term Indian originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies.[30][31][32][33][34][35] Eventually, those islands came to be known as the West Indies, a name still used. This led to the blanket term Indies and Indians (Spanish indios, Portuguese índios) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced by many over the last two centuries.[citation needed] Even though the term Indian generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas—such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years ago, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East—these groups are nonetheless considered indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Portuguese and Spanish equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, indios filipinos.</p><p>Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.[36] Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting, and gathering. In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, chiefdoms, states, and empires.</p><p>Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Greenland, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guaraní, Mayan languages, and Nahuatl, count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, social organization, and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects, but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from Western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples.</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>History[edit]</h2><h3>Migration into the continents[edit]</h3><p>For more details on theories of the migrations of the Paleo-Indians, see settlement of the Americas.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg/200px-Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg" width="200" height="126"><br><p>Illustration of Paleo-Indians hunting a glyptodont</p><p>The specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are the subject of ongoing research and discussion.[37][38] According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.[37] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of Beringia that joined Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska).[39][40] Alaska was a glacial refugium because it had low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of North America, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.[41][42]</p><p>Indigenous genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia.[43][44] The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10–20,000 years.[45][46][47] Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.[38][48][49] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets.[50]</p><p>Another route proposed involves migration – either on foot or using primitive boats – along the Pacific Northwest coast to the south, including as far as South America.[51] Archeological evidence of the latter would have been covered by the sea level rise of more than 120 meters since the last ice age.[52]</p><p>The time range of 40,000–16,500 years ago is debatable and probably will remain so for years to come.[37][38] The few agreements achieved to date include:[53][54]</p><p>Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Archaeologists and anthropologists have studied differences among these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods.[56] The Clovis culture, the earliest definitively-dated Paleo-Indians in the Americas, appears around 11,500 RCBP (radiocarbon years Before Present[57]), equivalent to 13,500 to 13,000 calendar years ago.</p><p>In 2014, the autosomal DNA was sequenced of a 12,500+-year-old infant from Montana, whose remains were found in close association with several Clovis artifacts.[58] These are the Anzick-1 remains from the Anzick Clovis burial in Montana. The data indicate that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America. Hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas were ruled out.[58] After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named 'Naia' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called sistema Sac Actun in Mexico's eastern Yucatán Peninsula. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.[59]</p><p>Pre-Columbian era[edit]

Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant European and African arrivals (ca. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through oral history and through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period, and were documented in historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, and Nahua peoples, had their own written languages and records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs, and burned many pre-Columbian written records. Only a few documents remained hidden and survived, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations before and at the time of European encounter had achieved great complexity and many accomplishments.[64] For instance, the Aztecs built one of the largest cities in the world, Tenochtitlan, the ancient site of Mexico City, with an estimated population of 200,000. American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics. The domestication of maize or corn required thousands of years of selective breeding, and continued cultivation of multiple varieties was done with planning and selection, generally by women.</p><p>Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and American Indian creation myths tell of a variety of origins of their respective peoples. Some were always there or were created by gods or animals, some migrated from a specified compass point, and others came from across the ocean.[65]</p><h3>European colonization[edit]</h3><p>Main article: European colonization of the Americas
See also: Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas and Columbian Exchange</p><br><br><p>Cultural areas of North America at time of European contact</p><p>The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the native peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera, which the early explorers brought from Europe and which spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. Conflicts between colonists and indigenous people exacerbated the loss of lives. Colonists frequently[quantify] perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.[66][67][68] According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.[69]</p><p>The first indigenous group encountered by Columbus, the 250,000 Taínos of Hispaniola, represented the dominant culture in the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Within thirty years about 70% of the Taínos had died.[70] They had no immunity to European diseases, so outbreaks of measles and smallpox ravaged their population.[71] Increasing punishment of the Taínos for revolting against forced labour, despite measures put in place by the encomienda, which included religious education and protection from warring tribes,[72] eventually led to the last great Taíno rebellion (1511–1529).</p><p>Following years of mistreatment, the Taínos began to adopt suicidal behaviors, with women aborting or killing their infants and men jumping from cliffs or ingesting untreated cassava, a violent poison.[70] Eventually, a Taíno Cacique named Enriquillo managed to hold out in the Baoruco Mountain Range for thirteen years, causing serious damage to the Spanish, Carib-held plantations and their Indian auxiliaries.[73][not in citation given] Hearing of the seriousness of the revolt, Emperor Charles V (also King of Spain) sent captain Francisco Barrionuevo to negotiate a peace treaty with the ever-increasing number of rebels. Two months later, after consultation with the Audencia of Santo Domingo, Enriquillo was offered any part of the island to live in peace.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in America, particularly with regard to native Indians.

Scholars[which?] now[when?] believe that, among the various contributing factors, epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives.[75][76] Some[quantify] believe that after first contacts with Europeans and Africans, Old World diseases caused the deaths of 90 to 95% of the native population of the New World in the following 150 years.[77] Smallpox killed up to one third of the native population of Hispaniola in 1518.[78] By killing the Incan ruler Huayna Capac, smallpox caused the Inca Civil War of 1529–1532. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Typhus (probably) in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, measles in 1618—all ravaged the remains of Inca culture.</p><p>Smallpox killed millions of native inhabitants of Mexico.[79][80] Unintentionally introduced at Veracruz with the arrival of Pánfilo de Narváez on April 23, 1520, smallpox ravaged Mexico in the 1520s,[81] possibly killing over 150,000 in Tenochtitlán (the heartland of the Aztec Empire) alone, and aiding in the victory of Hernán Cortés over the Aztec Empire at Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City) in 1521.[citation needed]</p><p>Over the centuries the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous Americans had no immunity.[82]</p><p>Exploration of the Caribbean led to the discovery of the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles. Their culture was destroyed by 1650. Only 500 had survived by the year 1550, though the bloodlines continued through to the modern populace.

As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population-groups of Native Americans.[86] It reached Lake Ontario in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679.[87][88] During the 1770s smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.[89] The 1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic and the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic brought devastation and drastic population depletion among the Plains Indians.[90][91] In 1832 the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans (The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832).[92][93]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The indigenous peoples in Brazil declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated three million[94] to some 300,000 in 1997.[dubious – discuss][not in citation given][95]</p><p>The Spanish Empire and other Europeans re-introduced horses to the Americas. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.[96] The re-introduction of the horse, extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on Native American culture in the Great Plains of North America and in Patagonia in South America. By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture game, especially bison.</p><h2>Agriculture[edit]</h2><p>See also: Agriculture in Mesoamerica and Incan agriculture</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Buffalo_Hunt.jpg/220px-Buffalo_Hunt.jpg" width="220" height="153"><br><p>A bison hunt depicted by George Catlin</p><p>Over time and thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[97] In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.</p><p>The South American highlands were a center of early agriculture. Genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern Peru,[98] from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex. Over 99% of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south-central Chile,[99] Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago.[100][101] According to George Raudzens, It is clear that in pre-Columbian times some groups struggled to survive and often suffered food shortages and famines, while others enjoyed a varied and substantial diet.[102] The persistent drought around 850 AD coincided with the collapse of Classic Maya civilization, and the famine of One Rabbit (AD 1454) was a major catastrophe in Mexico.[103]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg/220px-Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg" width="220" height="148"><br><p>Andenes in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Peru.

Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.[104]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the Mississippi River valley, Europeans noted Native Americans' managed groves of nut and fruit trees not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields. Further away, prescribed burning would have been used in forest and prairie areas.[105]</p><p>Many crops first domesticated by indigenous Americans are now produced and used globally. Chief among these is maize or corn, arguably the most important crop in the world.[106] Other significant crops include cassava, chia, squash (pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, acorn squash, butternut squash), the pinto bean, Phaseolus beans including most common beans, tepary beans and lima beans, tomatoes, potatoes, avocados, peanuts, cocoa beans (used to make chocolate), vanilla, strawberries, pineapples, Peppers (species and varieties of Capsicum, including bell peppers, jalapeños, paprika and chili peppers) sunflower seeds, rubber, brazilwood, chicle, tobacco, coca, manioc and some species of cotton.</p><p>Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management, including agro-forestry practices among Itza Maya in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the Menominee of Wisconsin, suggest that longstanding sacred values may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.[107]</p><h2>Culture[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Quechuawomanandchild.jpg/220px-Quechuawomanandchild.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Andes, Peru</p><p>Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a cultural area is Mesoamerica, where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><p>The languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area. Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the Chippewas and Delawares.[108]</p><h3>Writing systems[edit]</h3><p>See also: Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, Cherokee syllabary, and Quipu</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg/220px-Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg" width="220" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in Palenque, Mexico</p><p>The development of writing is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block. The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane.[109]</p><p>The Maya writing system was a combination of phonetic syllabic symbols and logograms—that is, it was a logosyllabic writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different glyphs, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.[110][111][112]</p><p>The Zapotec writing system is one of the earliest writing systems in the Americas.[113] The oldest example of the Zapotec script is a monument discovered in San José Mogote, dating from around from 600 BCE.[114] Zapotec writing was logographic and presumably syllabic.[113] The remains of the Zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture. There are only a few extant inscriptions, which makes study of this writing system difficult.</p><p>Aztec codices (singular codex) are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era Aztecs. These codices provide some of the best primary sources for Aztec culture. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.[115] The colonial era codices not only contain Aztec pictograms, but also Classical Nahuatl (in the Latin alphabet), Spanish, and occasionally Latin.</p><p>Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there is a large number of local-level documents in Nahuatl, Zapotec, Mixtec, and Yucatec Maya from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.[116] The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the New Philology to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.[117]</p><p>The Wiigwaasabak, birch bark scrolls on which the Ojibwa (Anishinaabe) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics.</p><p>Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply syllabics, is a family of abugidas used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the Algonquian, Inuit, and Athabaskan language families.</p><h3>Music and art[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas and Native American music</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg/220px-Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg" width="220" height="367"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Apache fiddle made by Chesley Goseyun Wilson (San Carlos Apache)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Gorget%2C_Peru%2C_north_coast%2C_Chimu_style%2C_c._1350-1450_AD%2C_feathers%2C_reeds%2C_copper_bars%2C_silver%2C_metal_overlaid_with_skin_-_Textile_Museum%2C_George_Washington_University_-_DSC09898.JPG/220px-thumbnail.jpg" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Chimu culture feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350–1450 CE</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/JuPi_1.jpg/220px-JuPi_1.jpg" width="220" height="313"><br><p>Textile art by Julia Pingushat (Inuk, Arviat, Nunavut Territory, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995</p><p>Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.[citation needed]</p><p>The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often pentatonic. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and wind instruments such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and rain tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European musical instruments; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.[118][dead link]</p><p>Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas comprise a major category in the world art collection. Contributions include pottery, paintings, jewellery, weavings, sculptures, basketry, carvings, and beadwork.[119] Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives[120] in order to profit from the cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe. To support the ongoing practice of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States,[121] the Ford Foundation, arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.[122][123]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png/220px-Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png" width="220" height="234"><br><p>This map shows the percentage of indigenous population in different countries of the Americas.</p><p>The following table provides estimates for each country in the Americas of the populations of indigenous people and those with partial indigenous ancestry, each expressed as a percentage of the overall population.

They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of empowered caciques to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.[153] While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged people identifying as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s.[154] Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted grassroots territorial organizations; these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas.</p><p>Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages.

Bolivia was the first nation in the history of South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to self-government.[155] Speaking in Santa Cruz Department, the President called it a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement, saying that, though he might make errors, he would never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people.[155] A vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in December 2009, at the same time as general elections to office. The issue divided the country.[156]</p><p>At that time, indigenous peoples voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy: five departments that had not already done so voted for it;[157][158] as did Gran Chaco Province in Taríja, for regional autonomy;[159] and 11 of 12 municipalities that had referendums on this issue.[157]</p><h3>Brazil[edit]</h3><p>See also: Indigenous peoples in Brazil and List of indigenous peoples in Brazil</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Terena005.jpg/200px-Terena005.jpg" width="200" height="291"><br><p>Brazilian indigenous man of Terena tribe</p><p>Indigenous peoples of Brazil make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 817,000 people, but millions of Brazilians are mestizo or have some indigenous ancestry.[160] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although in the 21st century, the majority of them live in indigenous territories in the North and Center-Western part of the country.

The Pipil lived in western El Salvador, spoke Nawat, and had many settlements there, most noticeably Cuzcatlan. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and fertile land that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other lands like Guatemala or Mexico, but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by Pedro de Alvarado along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like Izalco, Panchimalco, Sacacoyo, and Nahuizalco.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Guatemala[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Demographics of Guatemala</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Guat%C3%A9mala_78.jpg/220px-Guat%C3%A9mala_78.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Maya women from Guatemala</p><p>Most of the indigenous peoples of Guatemala are of Maya heritage.

				This article is about the continent. For the politico-economic union, see European Union. For other uses, see Europe (disambiguation).</p><p>Europe —a concept dating back to classical antiquity— is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The eastern boundary with Asia is an arbitrary historical and social construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. The primarily physiographic term continent as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities and lines of demarcation are not reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries with Asia. Europe is considered by historical convention as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.[5]</p><p>Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 740&nbsp;million (about 11% of world population) as of 2015[update].[6] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.</p><p>Europe, in particular ancient Greece, was the birthplace of Western civilization.[7][8][9] The fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the migration period, marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. From the Age of Discovery onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the majority of Asia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[10] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>In 1955, the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all states except for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Vatican City. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation.[11] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The European Anthem is Ode to Joy and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Name</h2><p>Further information: Europa (mythology)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Herodotus_World_Map.jpg/330px-Herodotus_World_Map.jpg" width="330" height="193"><br><p>Reconstruction of Herodotus' world map (450 BC)</p><p>In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient&nbsp;Greek: ????p?, Eur?pe) is the name of either a Phoenician princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements e???? (eurús), wide, broad[12] and ?? (ops, gen. ?p??, opós) eye, face, countenance,[13] hence their composite Eur?pe would mean wide-gazing or broad of aspect. Broad has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[14] For the second part compare also the divine attributes of grey-eyed Athena (??a???p??, glaukopis) or ox-eyed Hera (ß??p??, boopis).</p><p>There have been attempts to connect Eur?pe to a Semitic term for west, this being either Akkadian erebu meaning to go down, set (said of the sun) or Phoenician 'ereb evening, west,[15] which is at the origin of Arabic Maghreb and Hebrew ma'arav. Michael A. Barry, professor in Princeton University's Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of night, [the country of] sunset, in opposition to Asu [the country of] sunrise, i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to cartographic convention appears in Greek ??at??? (Anatol? [sun] rise, east, hence Anatolia).[16] Martin Litchfield West stated that phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor.[17] Next to these hypotheses there is also a Proto-Indo-European root *h1reg?os, meaning darkness, which also produced Greek Erebus.</p><p>Most major world languages use words derived from Eur?pe or Europa to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word Ouzhou (??/??); a similar Chinese-derived term Oshu (??) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, Oshu Rengo (????), despite the katakana Yoroppa (?????) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan (land of the Franks) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa.[18]</p><h2>Definition</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Further information: List of transcontinental countries and Boundaries between continents</p><h3>Contemporary definition</h3><p>Clickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[19]

Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.[20]</p><p>Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Europe as used specifically in British English may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[22]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>A medieval T and O map from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah — Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham)</p><p>The first recorded usage of Eur?pe as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC.[23] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[24] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[25] The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[26]</p><p>The convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[27] Strabo[28] and Ptolemy,[29] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.</p><p>The term Europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.</p><p>A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[30] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: Europa often[dubious – discuss] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[31]</p><p>Modern definitions

But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.</p><p>Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains.[32] introducing the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard.[33]</p><p>The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[34][35] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.</p><p>By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.[36]</p><p>In Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[37] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[38] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[39] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest[40] and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Europe</p><h3>Prehistory</h3><p>Main article: Prehistoric Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lascaux_painting.jpg/260px-Lascaux_painting.jpg" width="260" height="170"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c 15,000 BC)</p><p>Homo erectus georgicus, which lived roughly 1.8&nbsp;million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe.[41] Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1&nbsp;million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[42] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and their final refuge being present-day Portugal.

Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[45] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic.

Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[51] The Greeks city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[51] In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[52] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[53] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[54][55][56] In the course of the 5th century BC, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[57] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/RomanEmpire_117.svg/260px-RomanEmpire_117.svg.png" width="260" height="191"><br><p>The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg/170px-Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg" width="170" height="246"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Augustus wearing the Civic Crown</p><p>Greece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[51] Expanding from their base in Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BC, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe.[58]</p><p>The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[59][60] The Empire began to decline in the 3rd century, particularly in the west. Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 AD after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople in his honour (modern-day Istanbul) in 330 AD. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 AD, and in 391-392 AD, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[61] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 AD;[62] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century AD.</p><p>Main articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages

In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[66] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[67] Between 711 and 720, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule&nbsp;— save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance.</p><p>During the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.[68] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis&nbsp;I.[69] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[70]</p><p>East Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[71][72] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[73]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>High and Late Middle Ages</h3><p>Main articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages

Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.

Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.[74] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament.[75] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[74]</p><p>The Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[76] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula.[77]</p><p>In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[78] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[88][89][90]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mongols_suzdal.jpg/170px-Mongols_suzdal.jpg" width="170" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe.</p><p>In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[91] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[92] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[93][94] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[95] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.</p><p>The Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[96] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[97][98] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[99] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[100] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25&nbsp;million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[101]</p><p>The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, foreigners, beggars and lepers.[102] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[103] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[104]</p><p>Main article: Early modern period

The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.[105][106][107] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church, and an emerging merchant class.[108][109][110] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.[111][112]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism.

The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[114] This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[115] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[116]</p><p>The 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline.[117] Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[118] From the Union of Krewo (1385) central and eastern Europe was dominated by Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1648 and 1655 in the central and eastern Europe ended hegemony of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[119] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia). Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, laying siege to Vienna in 1529. In the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the Battle of Vienna permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe.</p><p>The Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development.[120] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Isaac Newton.[121] According to Peter Barrett, It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.[105]</p><p>In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Portugal and Spain, two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[122][123] Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia.[124] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>18th and 19th centuries</h3><p>Main article: Modern history

These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[135] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[136]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png/170px-The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png" width="170" height="203"><br><p>Ottoman Europe in 1856</p><p>In parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774).

The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912-1913.[137] Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg/220px-Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg" width="220" height="168"><br><p>Marshall's Temple Works (1840), the Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain</p><p>The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe.

Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[159] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[160]</p><p>The social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany, and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy, and in Ataturk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet, and state secularism. Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[161][162]</p><p>In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic.

On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland.

After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an Iron Curtain.

The EU established a parliament, court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[178] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[179]</p><h2>Geography</h2><p>Main article: Geography of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Europe_topography_map_en.png/220px-Europe_topography_map_en.png" width="220" height="179"><br><p>Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions</p><p>Europe makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[20] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[180] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.[181] Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.</p><p>This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.</p><h3>Climate</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Climate of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Vegetation_Europe.png/220px-Vegetation_Europe.png" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.[182] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed Europe's central heating, because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;°C (61&nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&nbsp;°C (54&nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8&nbsp;°C (14&nbsp;°<br>

Along with fellow cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, he is credited with drafting the first world map that named America as a land mass.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Biography[edit]</h2><p>Ringmann was born in Eichhoffen, Alsace in 1482. He became a schoolmaster and was often described as a poet.</p><p>Around 1503, Ringmann visited Italy. There, he learned about the newly discovered western lands and the explorations that took place within them. These lands were initially known as the New World, and were later named the Americas. He also came to believe that Amerigo Vespucci had discovered South America.</p><p>Upon his return, Ringmann moved to Saint-Dié-des-Vosges in Lorraine with his friend, Martin Waldseemüller, a cartographer with whom he was working on a new Latin edition of Ptolemy's treatise on geography. Waldseemüller drew the maps while Ringmann edited the translation and wrote the preface. Ringmann was probably also the author of the introduction to Waldseemüller's great map and globe of the world, yet many historians attribute the work to Waldseemüller himself. Some historians have judged that Walter Ludd, the head of the Gymnasium Vosagense, paid Ringmann and Waldseemüller to do this work for publication at the Gymnasium's printing press at St. Dié.</p><p>Ringmann also may have read the French edition of Vespucci's letters, (Quatre Navigations d' Americ Vespuce). Since Vespucci's written accounts were in Italian, the translation to French could have been the source of Ringmann's misunderstanding of the accepted discoverer of the New World, as he believed that Vespucci discovered the new world. He described this in his introduction:</p><p>There is a fourth quarter of the world which Amerigo Vespucci has discovered and which for this reason we can call 'America' or the land of Americus [the Latin version of the Italian name Amerigo]. […] We do not see why the name of the man of genius, Amerigo, who has discovered them, should not be given to these lands, as Europe and Asia have adopted the names of women.</p><p>When the book was published by the name Cosmographiae Introductio on April 25, 1507, it was the first time that the word 'Americas' appeared in print. Waldseemüller corrected the error in a later edition and named South America Terra Nova, but the name America had now already been established.</p><p>Ringmann corrected the texts of the Latin editions of Ptolemy's geography—which had been published previously at Rome and Ulm using a Greek manuscript borrowed from Italy (Codex Vaticanum Graecorum 191.) During this time, Waldseemüller edited the Ptolemaic maps and also added twenty new maps to the collection. This was what was known as the first modern atlas of the world.</p><p>In 1508, Ringmann made the first translation of Julius Caesar's Commentaries into German with supplemental pieces by Suetonius, Plutarch, and others. One year later, he published a card game, Grammatica Figurata, to make the grammatical rules of Donatus', Ars Minor, more appealing to children. He died in 1511 in Sélestat.</p><h2>Grammatica Figurata[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/GrammaticaFigurata2.gif/220px-GrammaticaFigurata2.gif" width="220" height="282"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Grammatica Figurata (1509)</p><p>The Grammatica Figurata was first published by Mathias Ringmann in 1509. This work was an attempt to enliven Donatus' Ars Minor by printing up illustrated card sets for each grammatical rule. Apparently the children would have a card set. The rules are not explained at length, but a few hints are scattered here and there in the work. The final section on Exclamations has a sentence on how to figure out which student has won. Each card represented a part of speech, a gender, a case, or a tense, etc. Depending upon the teacher's questions a student would play the appropriate card or cards. Long believed to be lost, one copy of Grammatica figurata was found and reprinted in 1905.[2] Of particular interest are Ringmann's digressions on assorted subjects, from the prevalence of gambling among the German priesthood to the reasons behind his refusal to illustrate full-frontal nudity.</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><li id="cite_note-3">^ Jennie, Cohen.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd (1846 – 7 October 1920) was a native of Clifton, Bristol, England. An accountant as a young man, his means were such that he was able to pursue his interests as a naturalist and antiquarian. He was a member of a number of societies, often assuming leadership positions. Hudd is perhaps best known for his roles as author of Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District, editor of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, supervisor of the excavations undertaken by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, and author of Richard Ameryk and the name America.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background[edit]</h2><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd, son of leather merchant Samuel Hudd and his wife Mary Ann, was born in the second quarter of 1846 in Clifton.[1][2] An accountant, he married Catharine Bowles Edmonds in the first quarter of 1872, their marriage recorded in the registration district of Faringdon, Berkshire.[3] In 1881, Alfred and his wife resided at Clinton House on Pembroke Road in Clifton.[4]</p><h2>Naturalist[edit]</h2><p>By 1870, Hudd was a member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, which had been founded in 1862.[5][6] He was first appointed to the Council of the society on 6 May 1875, and remained a member of the Council for years, until about 1892.[7][8][9] After a hiatus as a Council member for several years, Hudd was reappointed to the Council in 1899, where he remained until at least 1901.[10] He specialised in entomology. His Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District was published in six parts in the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society:</p><p>Hudd was also a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London, founded in 1833, and now known as the Royal Entomological Society of London.[17][18] In 1912, he presented his collection of 1300 coleoptera (beetle) specimens to the Bristol Museum and Library, now the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, to supplement the Stephen Barton (d. 1898) collection. His collection of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) specimens was added to the George C. Griffiths (1852–1924) collection at the Bristol Museum.[18] Hudd also contributed a short chapter on The Insects of the Bristol District to the Handbook to Bristol and the neighbourhood.[19]</p><h2>Antiquarian[edit]</h2><p>Hudd was elected secretary of the Clifton Antiquarian Club at its first meeting on 23 January 1884 at the Bristol Museum and Library.[20] He retained that position during all twenty-eight years of the original society. Not only a founding member of the club, Alfred Edmund Hudd had the distinction of being the only member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club to remain with the original organisation from its inception in 1884 to its end in 1912. He served as editor of the society's seven volumes of Proceedings,[21] also contributing 21 papers.[22] His service to the organisation was acknowledged on 5 January 1898 when the club presented him with a silver bowl and a set of four silver candlesticks.[23] In 1911, the membership of the club again paid tribute to his efforts, with an inscribed, inlaid grandfather clock.[21]</p><p>Alfred Hudd was a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and served on its Council.[24][25] On 9 August 1904, he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland at a meeting of that organisation held at Tuam, County Galway.[26] In addition, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27]</p><h2>Caerwent Exploration Fund[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg/160px-Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg" width="160" height="213"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Excavations at Caerwent in south Wales</p><p>Alfred Hudd was closely involved with the Caerwent Exploration Fund. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in February 1899, Alfred Trice Martin, also a founding member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, suggested that a systematic excavation of Caerwent, a Roman town in south Wales, be undertaken.[27] The Caerwent Exploration Fund was established by the Clifton Antiquarian Club soon thereafter. In September 1899, at Caerwent, Godfrey Morgan, Lord Tredegar, was elected President of the Caerwent Exploration Fund and Alfred Hudd was elected Treasurer.[27][28] Hudd and Thomas Ashby, Junior, both members of the Executive Committee of the Fund, supervised the excavations at Caerwent.[29] During the period between 1899 and 1913, two-thirds of the Roman town in south Wales was revealed. The archive of Caerwent, which was discovered during the excavations by the Fund, is in the archaeology collection of Newport Museum.[29] The reports on the excavations at Caerwent were published in Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27] Much of the success of the Caerwent Exploration Fund has been attributed to Alfred Hudd.[30]</p><h2>The naming of America[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Stradanus_America.jpg/220px-Stradanus_America.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>America by Johannes Stradanus
(1523–1605). "Americus rediscovers America. He called her but once and thenceforth she was always awake."[31]</p><p>The traditional theory of the naming of America is that it was named in honour of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator. At the turn of the sixteenth century, Vespucci undertook a series of voyages (the number of which remains unresolved) in search of a western passage to the Indies. After the voyage of 1501–1502, he proposed that the areas that he and, separately, Christopher Columbus had explored were not part of Asia, but rather a New World.[32][33] America first received its name in the Cosmographiae Introductio, published by cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in 1507. Vespucci's published letters (the authenticity of which is contested) were the inspiration for that work, which was authored by a group of scholars in Saint-Dié, Lorraine, France. They revised Ptolemy's Geography to include the New World and reasoned that, as the three previously known continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, had feminine names, so should the New World. Accordingly, the feminised version of the Latin form of the baptismal name of the discoverer of the New World, Vespucci, was utilised.[32][33] The appendix of the book included Waldseemüller's map of the world in which the New World was labelled America. The map, rediscovered in a German castle in 1901, was the first to use the name America and the first to depict a Western Hemisphere.[33][34] The Library of Congress purchased the 1507 Waldseemüller map in 2003. On 30 April 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel transferred the map, also known as America's birth certificate, to the people of the United States in a ceremony at the Library of Congress.[35]</p><p>There are several alternate theories of the naming of America.[33] Alfred Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings. In Richard Ameryk and the name America, Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498–1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from King Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for handing over the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503).[33][36] Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Further, Hudd quoted a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497.[33][36]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This year (1497), on St. John the Baptist's day (June 24th), the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristow, in a ship of Bristowe called the 'Mathew,' the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe the 2nd of May and came home again the 6th August following.[36]</p><p>Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 Cosmographiae Introductio, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci.[33][36] While Hudd's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, there is no hard proof to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk.[33][37][38]</p><h2>Later life[edit]</h2><p>Hudd's first wife Kate died on 4 April 1889 and was buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery in Naples, Italy.[39] Hudd married Adeline Sophia Tyzack in the fourth quarter of 1891 in the registration district of Kensington, London.[3] In 1901, he resided at 94 Pembroke Road in Clifton with his second wife Adeline and two daughters.[40] Alfred Edmund Hudd of 108 Pembroke Road in Clifton died on 7 October 1920, his death registered in Bristol in the fourth quarter of the year. His estate of almost £16,000 went to probate on 17 December 1920. His wife survived him.[41][42]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

For other uses, see Amerigo Vespucci (disambiguation).</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci (Italian pronunciation:&nbsp;[ame'ri?go ves'putt?i]; March 9, 1454&nbsp;– February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Old Worlders.</p><p>Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed Americas, deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of Vespucci's first name.[1][2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background</h2><br><br><p>The birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was born and raised in Florence on the Italian Peninsula. He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.[3][4] The father of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci had the name Amerigo Vespucci also. [5]</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence. While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by Lorenzo de' Medici. Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.[3] In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with Christopher Columbus and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies. Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.[3] After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.[3]</p><h2>Expeditions</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>At the invitation of king Manuel I of Portugal, Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502. On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.</p><p>The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus. In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset Christopher Columbus' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.[citation needed]</p><h2>Historical role</h2><p>In 1508, the position of chief of navigation of Spain (piloto mayor de Indias) was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg/200px-Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Vespucci's first encounter with Native Americans in Honduras, 1497 (De Bry's illustration, c.1592)</p><p>Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. Mundus Novus (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from Lisbon to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502. Mundus Novus was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.[6] Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as Lettera al Soderini or just Lettera, was a letter in Italian addressed to Piero Soderini. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German Martin Waldseemüller in 1507 in Cosmographiae Introductio, a book on cosmography and geography, as Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).[6]</p><p>On March 22, 1508, King Ferdinand made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary[7] and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg/200px-Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg" width="200" height="133"><br><p>The first known depiction of cannibalism in the New World.

One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the four voyages. Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.[6]</p><p>Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in Lorraine. Vespucci used a Latinised form of his name, Americus Vespucius, in his Latin writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form America, according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women. It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him.[8]</p><p>The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.</p><p>Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.</p><h2>Voyages</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg/170px-Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg" width="170" height="297"><br><p>Portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child, part of the Madonna della Misericordia (c. 1472) by Domenico Ghirlandaio at the Ognissanti church in Florence</p><p>The first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabulous, but the second and third are certain.</p><h3>First voyage</h3><p>A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.[9] Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.[10] The names of Amerigo Vespucci's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Second voyage</h3><p>About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with Alonso de Ojeda (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.[11] After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of Hispaniola. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially [12] on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,[12] which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.</p><h3>Third voyage</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg/220px-Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg" width="220" height="299"><br><p>Portrait of Vespucci which titles him "discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land"</p><p>The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by Gonçalo Coelho in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal. Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of Pedro Álvares Cabral's ships returning from India. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.[11] On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif/lossless-page1-250px-%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif.png" width="250" height="183"><br><p>Vespucci awakens "America" in a Stradanus engraving (circa 1638)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula.[13] Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by Ptolemy or Marco Polo and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.[citation needed]</p><h3>Fourth voyage</h3><p>Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.[14] The only source of information for the last voyage is the Letter to Soderini,[15] but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip.[b] However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain Gonçalo Coelho, very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well.[16] However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.</p><p>The letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.[17]</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Vespucci was a cousin of the husband of Simonetta Vespucci. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.</p><h2>Final years</h2><p>Not long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by Ferdinand II of Aragon in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish House of Trade, based in Seville.</p><p>He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain.[18][19]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>a Europeans had long conceptualized the Afro-Eurasian landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: Europe, Asia, and Africa. Once cosmographers realized that the New World was not connected to the Old (but before its true geography was fully mapped), they considered the Americas to be a single, fourth continent.


b The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 Mundus Novus and the 1505 Letter of Soderini, the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924). He proposed the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the "Ridolfi fragment" (Formisiano, 1992: p.37–44) – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship. The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful. Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp. the first) differing from Arciniegas. Fernández-Armesto (2007: p.128) declares the authenticity question "inconclusive", hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2> </h2><h2>References</h2><h2> </h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Newfoundland (/nju?f?n'lænd/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen) new-f?n-LAND;[5] Spanish: Terranova, French: Terre-Neuve, Mi'kmaq: Taqamkuk, Irish: Talamh an Éisc, Inuttitut: Kallunasillik / Ikkarumikluak[6]) is a large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland, and the most populous part of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It has 29 percent of the province's land area. The island is separated from the Labrador Peninsula by the Strait of Belle Isle and from Cape Breton Island by the Cabot Strait. It blocks the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, creating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the world's largest estuary. Newfoundland's nearest neighbour is the French overseas community of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.</p><p>With an area of 108,860 square kilometres (42,031&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[7] Newfoundland is the world's 16th-largest island, Canada's fourth-largest island, and the largest Canadian island outside the North. The provincial capital, St. John's, is located on the southeastern coast of the island; Cape Spear, just south of the capital, is the easternmost point of North America, excluding Greenland. It is common to consider all directly neighbouring islands such as New World, Twillingate, Fogo and Bell Island to be 'part of Newfoundland' (as distinct from Labrador). By that classification, Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of 111,390 square kilometres (43,008&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).[8]</p><p>According to 2006 official Census Canada statistics, 57% of responding Newfoundland and Labradorians claim British or Irish ancestry, with 43.2% claiming at least one English parent, 21.5% at least one Irish parent, and 7% at least one parent of Scottish origin. Additionally 6.1% claimed at least one parent of French ancestry.[9] The island's total population as of the 2006 census was 479,105.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Long settled by indigenous peoples of the Dorset culture, the island was visited by the Icelandic Viking Leif Eriksson in the 11th century, who called the new land Vinland.[citation needed] The next European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. The island was visited by the Genoese navigator John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), working under contract to King Henry VII of England on his expedition from Bristol in 1497. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. (After European settlement, colonists first called the island Terra Nova, from New Land in Portuguese and Latin.)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Gilbert_plaque.jpg/150px-Gilbert_plaque.jpg" width="150" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Plaque commemorating Gilbert's founding of the British Empire</p><p>On August 5, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland as England's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I of England, thus officially establishing a fore-runner to the much later British Empire.[10] Newfoundland is considered Britain's oldest colony.[11] At the time of English settlement, the Beothuk inhabited the island.</p><p>While there is archaeological evidence of ancient indigenous peoples on the island, it was abandoned when the Norse arrived from Scandinavia.[citation needed] L'Anse aux Meadows was a Norse settlement near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland (Cape Norman), which has been dated to be approximately 1,000 years old. The site is considered the only undisputed evidence of Pre-Columbian contact between the Old and New Worlds, if the Norse-Inuit contact on Greenland is not counted. There is a second suspected Norse site in Point Rosee. The island is a likely location of Vinland, mentioned in the Viking Chronicles, although this has been disputed.</p><p>The indigenous people on the island at the time of European settlement were the Beothuk, who spoke an Amerindian language of the same name. Later immigrants developed a variety of dialects associated with settlement on the island: Newfoundland English, Newfoundland French.[citation needed] In the 19th century, it also had a dialect of Irish known as Newfoundland Irish.[citation needed] Scottish Gaelic was spoken on the island during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the Codroy Valley area, chiefly by settlers from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.[12] The Gaelic names reflected the association with fishing: in Scottish Gaelic, it was called Eilean a' Trosg, or literally, Island of the Cod.[13] Similarly, the Irish Gaelic name Talamh an Éisc means Land of the Fish.</p><h3>First inhabitants[edit]</h3><p>The first inhabitants of Newfoundland were the Paleo-Eskimo, who have no known link to other groups in Newfoundland history. Little is known about them beyond archeological evidence of early settlements. Evidence of successive cultures have been found. The Late Paleo-Eskimo, or Dorset culture, settled there about 4,000 years ago. They were descendants of migrations of ancient prehistoric peoples across the High Arctic thousands of years ago, after crossing from Siberia via the Bering land bridge. The Dorset died off or abandoned the island prior to the arrival of the Norse.[citation needed]</p><p>After this period, the Beothuk settled Newfoundland, migrating from Labrador on the mainland. There is no evidence that the Beothuk inhabited the island prior to Norse settlement. Scholars believe that the Beothuk are related closely to the Innu of Labrador.[citation needed] The tribe later became extinct although people of partial Beothuk descent have been documented[citation needed]. The name Beothuk means people in their own language which is a member of the Algonquian language family which itself is common to many Atlantic coastal tribes.</p><p>The tribe is now extinct but evidence of its culture is preserved in museum, historical and archaeological records. Shanawdithit, a woman who is often regarded as the last full-blood Beothuk, died in St. John's in 1829 of tuberculosis. However, Santu Toney, who was born around 1835 and died in 1910, was a woman of mixed Mi'kmaq and Beothuk descent which means that some Beothuk must have lived on beyond 1829. Her father was a Beothuk and mother a Mi'kmaq, both from Newfoundland. The Beothuk may have intermingled and assimilated with Innu in Labrador and Mi'kmaq in Newfoundland. Oral histories also suggest potential historical competition and hostility between the Beothuk and Mi'kmaq.[citation needed] The Mi'kmaq, Innu and Inuit all hunted and fished around Newfoundland before the arrival of Europeans but no evidence indicates that they lived on the island for long periods of time and would only travel to Newfoundland temporarily. Inuit have been documented on the Great Northern Peninsula as late as the 18th-Century. Newfoundland was historically the southernmost part of the Inuit's territorial range.</p><p>When Europeans arrived from 1497 and later, starting with John Cabot, they established contact with the Beothuk. Estimates of the number of Beothuk on the island at this time vary, ranging from 700 to 5,000.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Later both the English and French settled the island. They were followed by the Mi'kmaq, an Algonquian-speaking indigenous people from eastern Canada and present-day Nova Scotia. As European and Mi'kmaq settlement became year-round and expanded to new areas of the coast, the area available to the Beothuk to harvest the marine resources they relied upon was diminished. By the beginning of the 19th century, few Beothuk remained. Most died due to infectious diseases carried by Europeans, to which they had no immunity, and starvation. Government attempts to engage with the Beothuk and aid them came too late. The Beothuk were exceptionally hostile to foreigners, unlike the Mi'kmaq. The latter readily traded with Europeans and became established in settlements in Newfoundland.</p><h3>European contact, colonisation and settlement[edit]</h3><p>Main article: History of Newfoundland and Labrador</p><p>Newfoundland is the site of the only authenticated Norse (mostly Greenlandic Icelanders) settlement in North America. This archeological site was discovered by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, at L'Anse aux Meadows in 1960. The site has been the subject of multi-year archaeological digs in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>These have revealed that the settlement dated to more than 500 years before John Cabot; it contains the earliest-known European structures in North America. Designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO, it is believed to be the Vinland settlement of explorer Leif Eiriksson. (The Icelandic Skálholt Vinland Map of 1570 refers to the area as Promontorium Winlandiæ and correctly shows it on a 51°N parallel with Bristol, England). The Norse stayed for a relatively short period of time, believed to be between 999 and 1001 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Cabot_tower.jpg/250px-Cabot_tower.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>Cabot Tower located in St John's</p><p>After the departure of the Norse, the island was inhabited by aboriginal populations for nearly 500 years. In 1497, the Italian navigator John Cabot (Zuan/Giovanni Cabotto) became the first European since the Norse settlers to set foot on Newfoundland, working under commission of King Henry VII of England. His landing site is unknown but popularly believed to be Cape Bonavista, along the island's East coast.,[14] Another site claimed is Cape Bauld, at the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula. A document found in the Spanish National Archives, written by a Bristol merchant, reports that Cabot's crew landed 1,800 miles (2,900&nbsp;km) west of Dursey Head, Ireland (latitude 51° 35'N), which would put Cabot within sight of Cape Bauld. This document mentions an island that Cabot sailed past to go ashore on the mainland. This description fits with the Cape Bauld theory, as Belle Isle is not far offshore.[14]</p><p>After Cabot, the first European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Late in the 17th century came Irish fishermen, who named the island Talamh an Éisc, meaning land of the fish, or the fishing grounds in Irish Gaelic. This reflected the abundance of fisheries.</p><p>In 1583, when Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally claimed Newfoundland as a colony of England, he found numerous English, French and Portuguese vessels at St. John's. There was no permanent population. Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, and plans of settlement were postponed.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>On July 5, 1610, John Guy set sail from Bristol, England with 39 other colonists for Cuper's Cove. This, and other early attempts at permanent settlement failed to make a profit for the English investors, but some settlers remained, forming the very earliest modern European population on the island. By 1620, the fishermen of England's West Country dominated the east coast of Newfoundland. French fishermen dominated the island's south coast and Northern Peninsula.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg/250px-Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg" width="250" height="244"><br><p>James Cook's 1775 Chart of Newfoundland</p><p>After 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, the French ceded control of south and north shores of the island to the British. They kept only the nearby islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, located in the fish-rich Grand Banks off the south coast. Despite some early settlements by the English, the Crown discouraged permanent, year-round settlement of Newfoundland by migratory fishery workers. Thomas Nash was an Irish Catholic fisherman who permanently settled in Newfoundland despite English rule. He established the fishing town of Branch.[15] He and his cousin Father Patrick Power of Callan, County Kilkenny, spread Catholicism in Newfoundland. This settlement attracted a major migration of Irish Catholic immigrants to Newfoundland in the early eighteenth century.[16]</p><p>By the late 18th century, permanent settlement increased, peaking in the early years of the 19th century.[17]</p><p>The French name for the island is Terre Neuve. The name Newfoundland' is one of the oldest European place names in Canada in continuous geographical and cartographical use, dating from a 1502 letter. It was stated in the following 1628 poem:</p><p>A Skeltonicall continued ryme, in praise of my New-found-Land</p><p>Although in cloaths, company, buildings faire
With England, New-found-land cannot compare:
Did some know what contentment I found there,
Alwayes enough, most times somewhat to spare,
With little paines, lesse toyle, and lesser care,
Exempt from taxings, ill newes, Lawing, feare,
If cleane, and warme, no matter what you weare,
Healthy, and wealthy, if men careful are,
With much-much more, then I will now declare,
(I say) if some wise men knew what this were
(I doe beleeue) they'd live no other where.

It was also different from those other immigrants would build on the North American mainland. As a fish-exporting society, Newfoundland was in contact with many ports and societies around the Atlantic rim. But its geographic location and political distinctiveness isolated it from its closest neighbours, Canada and the United States. Internally, most of its population was spread widely around a rugged coastline in small outport settlements. Many were distant from larger centres of population and isolated for long periods by winter ice or bad weather. These conditions had an effect on the cultures of the immigrants. They generated new ways of thinking and acting. Newfoundland and Labrador developed a wide variety of distinctive customs, beliefs, stories, songs and dialects.</p><p>The First World War had a powerful and lasting effect on the society. From a population of about a quarter of a million, 5,482 men went overseas. Nearly 1,500 were killed and 2,300 wounded. On July 1, 1916, at Beaumont-Hamel, France, 753 men of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment went over the top of a trench. The next morning, only 68 men answered the roll-call. Even now, when the rest of Canada celebrates the founding of the country on July 1, many Newfoundlanders take part in solemn ceremonies of remembrance.</p><p>The Second World War also had a lasting effect on Newfoundland. In particular, the United States assigned forces to the military bases at Argentia, Gander, Stephenville, Goose Bay and St. John's.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg/250px-Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg" width="250" height="192"><br><p>Joseph Smallwood signing the document bringing Newfoundland into Confederation.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador is the youngest province in Canada. Newfoundland was organised as a colony in 1825, was self-governing from 1855–1934, and held dominion status from 1907–1949 (see Dominion of Newfoundland). In late 1948, the population of the colony voted 52.3% to 47.7%[18] in favour of joining Canada as a province. Opposition was concentrated among residents of the capital St. John's, and on the Avalon Peninsula.</p><p>Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949. Union with Canada has done little to reduce Newfoundlanders' self-image as a unique group. In 2003, 72% of residents responding identified first as Newfoundlanders, secondarily as Canadians.[19] Separatist sentiment is low, though, less than 12% in the same 2003 study.</p><p>The referendum campaign of 1948 was bitterly fought, and interests in both Canada and Britain favoured and supported confederation with Canada. Jack Pickersgill, a western Canadian native and politician, worked with the confederation camp during the campaign. The Catholic Church, whose members were a minority on the island, lobbied for continued independence. Canada offered financial incentives, including a baby bonus for each child in a family. The Confederates were led by the charismatic Joseph Smallwood, a former radio broadcaster, who had developed socialist political inclinations while working for a socialist newspaper in New York City. His policies as premier were closer to liberalism than socialism.</p><p>Following confederation, Smallwood led Newfoundland for decades as the elected premier. He was said to have a cult of personality among his many supporters. Some residents featured photographs of Joey in their living rooms in a place of prominence.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Flags of Newfoundland[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign%2C_1870%E2%80%931904.svg/175px-Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign%2C_1870%E2%80%931904.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Newfoundland Blue Ensign, Newfoundland's colonial government flag from 1870 to 1904</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign.png/175px-Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The "updated" Newfoundland Blue Ensign, government ensign from 1904 to 1965</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Red_Ensign.svg/175px-Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Red_Ensign.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Newfoundland Red Ensign, Newfoundland's civil ensign from 1904 to 1965</p><p>The first flag to specifically represent Newfoundland is thought to have been an image of a green fir tree on a pink background that was in use in the early 19th century.[20] The first official flag identifying Newfoundland, flown by vessels in service of the colonial government, was the Newfoundland Blue Ensign, adopted in 1870 and used until 1904, when it was modified slightly. In 1904, the crown of the Blue Ensign was replaced with the Great Seal of Newfoundland (having been given royal approval in 1827) and the British Parliament designated Newfoundland Red and Blue ensigns as official flags specifically for Newfoundland. The Red and Blue ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were used officially from 1904 until 1965, with the Red Ensign being flown as civil ensign by merchant shipping, and the Blue being flown by governmental ships (after the British tradition of having different flags for merchant/naval and government vessel identification).</p><p>On September 26, 1907, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom declared the Colony of Newfoundland, as an independent Dominion within the British Empire,[21] and from that point until 1965, the Newfoundland Red Ensign was used as the civil ensign of the Dominion of Newfoundland with the Blue Ensign, again, reserved for government shipping identification.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Central America (Spanish: América Central or Centroamérica) is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)[2] and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America—except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama—was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, though, people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state (e.g. it is still common to write C.A. after the country names, in formal and informal contexts).</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Different definitions[edit]</h2><p>Central America may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Central America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg/220px-1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg" width="220" height="300"><br><p>Central America, 1798</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG/220px-Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG" width="220" height="293"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Tikal, Guatemala.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Tazumal_10.jpg/220px-Tazumal_10.jpg" width="220" height="149"><br><p>Tazumal, El Salvador.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg/220px-CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg" width="220" height="155"><br><p>Copan, Honduras.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg/220px-Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>Altun Ha, Belize.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg/220px-Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Stone spheres of Costa Rica.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg/220px-HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg" width="220" height="157"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Ancient footprints of Acahualinca, Nicaragua.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some[11] culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.</p><p>Following Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.[citation needed]</p><p>In 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.</p><p>The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.</p><p>From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.[citation needed]</p><p>The Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.[citation needed]</p><p>The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506–1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.[citation needed]</p><p>Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice and violence are still widespread.[12] Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere (only Haiti is poorer).[13]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>See also: Geography of Belize, Geography of Costa Rica, Geography of El Salvador, Geography of Guatemala, Geography of Honduras, Geography of Nicaragua, Geography of Panama, List of islands of Central America, and List of mountain peaks of Central America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Map_of_Central_America.png/220px-Map_of_Central_America.png" width="220" height="157"><br><p>The seven countries of Central America and their capitals</p><p>Central America is the tapering isthmus of southern North America, with unique and varied geographic features. The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America,[7] while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Isthmus of Panama, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.</p><p>Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At 4,220 meters (13,850&nbsp;ft), Volcán Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:</p><p>High points in Central America</p><p>Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.[14]</p><p>Trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.[15]</p><h2>Biodiversity[edit]</h2><p>See also: Central America bioregion</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg/220px-El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg" width="220" height="296"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>El Chorreron in El Salvador</p><p>Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.[16] The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropic ecozones. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.[16] The table below shows recent statistics:</p><p>Biodiversity in Central America (number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants)</p><p>Over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.[24]</p><p>Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.[25] A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species. So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.[26]</p><h3>Flora[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg/220px-Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>One of the hanging bridges of the skywalk at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Monteverde, Costa Rica disappearing into the clouds</p><p>From 2001 to 2010, 5,376 square kilometers (2,076&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers (4,711&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers (1,830&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers (793&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers (3,310&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers (1,180&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.[27]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers (43,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[28] extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between 600–1,800 metres (2,000–5,900&nbsp;ft) elevation,[28] and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above 1,800 metres (5,900&nbsp;ft) are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.</p><p>Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1,000 meters (3,300&nbsp;ft) above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia.[29] The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.</p><p>The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund.[30] These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800–4,000 metres (5,900–13,100&nbsp;ft), on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers (5,100&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.[30]</p><h3>Fauna[edit]</h3><p>See also: List of Central American mammals and List of Central American monkey species</p><p>Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America.[29] The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Tectonic_plates_Caribbean.png/220px-Tectonic_plates_Caribbean.png" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Central America and the Caribbean Plate

Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.</p><p>Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some 60–160 kilometers (37–99&nbsp;mi) off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.[31] For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.</p><p>The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.</p><p>Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly 80 kilometers (50&nbsp;mi) to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.[32]</p><p>Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.</p><p>Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>See also: Ethnic groups in Central America and Latin Americans</p><p>The population of Central America is estimated at 42,688,190 as of 2012.[3] With an area of 523,780 square kilometers (202,230&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[2] it has a population density of 81 per square kilometer (210/sq&nbsp;mi).</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png/220px-Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png" width="220" height="146"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Linguistic variations of classic Central American Spanish.

However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.</p><p>In 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the Central American Integration System (Sistema para la Integración Centroamericana, or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the Dominican Republic, a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.</p><p>On 6 December 2008 SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.[citation needed] No timeline for implementation was discussed.</p><p>Central America already has several supranational institutions such as the Central American Parliament, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common Market.</p><p>On 22 July 2011 President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador became the first president pro tempore to SICA.

The parliament's beginnings started at around 1980, and its primary goal was to solve wars in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA.

				This article is about the British city. For other uses, see Bristol (disambiguation).</p><p>Bristol (/'br?st?l/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) is a city and county[4] in South West England with a population of 454,200[5] in 2017. The district has the 10th largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.</p><p>Iron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English the place at the bridge). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham in the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the U.K.- the Bristol pound, which is pegged to the Pound sterling. The city has two universities, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England, and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the Royal West of England Academy, the Arnolfini, Spike Island, Ashton Gate and the Memorial Stadium. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road, rail, sea and air by the M5 and M4 (which connect to the city centre by the Portway and M32), Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway mainline rail stations, and Bristol Airport.</p><p>One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness series of travel guides. The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the EU's European Green Capital Award in 2015.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>The most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge.[6] It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer.[7] Alternative etymologies are supported with the numerous orthographic variations in Medieval documents with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.[8]</p><p>The Old English form Brycgstow is commonly used to derive the meaning place at the bridge.[9] Utilizing another form, Brastuile, Rev. Dr. Shaw derived the name from the Celtic words bras (quick, rapid), or braos (a gap, chasm,) and tuile (a stream). The poet Thomas Chatterton popularised a derivation from Brictricstow linking the town to Brictric, the last king of Wessex. It appears that the form Bricstow prevailed until 1204,[10] and the Bristolian 'L' (the tendency for the local accent to add a letter L to the end of some words) is what eventually changed the name to Bristol.[11]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: History of Bristol and Timeline of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Fifteenth-century pictorial map of Bristol, radiating from the town centre" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png/220px-Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png" width="220" height="345"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Robert Ricart's map of Bristol, drawn when he became common clerk of the town in 1478.

Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.[16]</p><h3>Middle Ages[edit]</h3><p>Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name.[17] By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons.[17] Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England.[18] Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.[19]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg/220px-Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Black and white etching showing the towers of St Stephen's Church, St Augustine the Less Church and Bristol Cathedral, published c.1850</p><p>The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls.[20] By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s.[21] The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373,[22] the first town in England to be given this status.[23][24][25] During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre.[26] By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London.[27] One-third to one-half the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49,[28] which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.[29]</p><h3>15th and 16th centuries[edit]</h3><p>During the 15th century Bristol was the second most important port in the country, trading with Ireland,[30] Iceland[31] and Gascony.[26] It was the starting point for many voyages, including Robert Sturmy's (1457–58) unsuccessful attempt to break the Italian monopoly of Eastern Mediterranean trade.[32] New exploration voyages were launched by Venetian John Cabot, who in 1497 made landfall in North America.[33] A 1499 voyage, led by merchant William Weston of Bristol, was the first expedition commanded by an Englishman to North America.[34] During the first decade of the 16th century Bristol's merchants undertook a series of exploration voyages to North America and even founded a commercial organisation, 'The Company Adventurers to the New Found Land', to assist their endeavours.[35] However, they seem to have lost interest in North America after 1509, having incurred great expenses and made little profit.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>During the 16th century, Bristol merchants concentrated on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies.[36] This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, such as food and guns, to Iberia[37] during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604).[38] Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.[39]</p><br><img alt="A stone built Victorian Gothic building with two square towers and a central arched entrance underneath a circular ornate window.

Bristol also gained city status that year.[42] During the English Civil War in the 1640s the city was occupied by Royalists, who built the Royal Fort House on the site of an earlier Parliamentarian stronghold.[43]</p><h3>17th and 18th centuries[edit]</h3><p>Growth of the city and trade came with the rise of England's American colonies in the 17th century. Bristol's location on the west side of Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made the most of it. The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery to the Americas. Bristol and Liverpool became centres of the Triangular Trade. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the Middle Passage under brutal conditions.[44] In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic.[44] Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The Somersett Case of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England.[45] At the height of the Bristol slave trade from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas.[46] The Seven Stars public house,[47] where abolitionist Thomas Clarkson collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.[48]</p><br><img alt=" An engraving showing at the top a sailing ship and paddle steamer in a harbour, with sheds and a church spire.

Because of Bristol's nautical environment, maritime safety was an important issue in the city. During the 19th century, Samuel Plimsoll, known as the sailor's friend, campaigned to make the seas safer; shocked by overloaded vessels, he successfully fought for a compulsory load line on ships.[50]</p><p>In 1739 John Wesley founded the first Methodist chapel, the New Room, in Bristol.[51] Wesley, along with his brother Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, preached to large congregations in Bristol and the neighbouring village of Kingswood, often in the open air.[52][53]</p><h3>19th century[edit]</h3><p>The city was associated with Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway between Bristol and London Paddington, two pioneering Bristol-built oceangoing steamships (SS&nbsp;Great Britain and SS&nbsp;Great Western), and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The new railway replaced the Kennet and Avon Canal, which had fully opened in 1810 as the main route for the transport of goods between Bristol and London.[54] Competition from Liverpool (beginning around 1760), disruptions of maritime commerce due to war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to Bristol's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of Northern England and the West Midlands. The tidal Avon Gorge, which had secured the port during the Middle Ages, had become a liability. An 1804–09 plan to improve the city's port with a floating harbour designed by William Jessop was a costly error, requiring high harbour fees.[55]</p><p>By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over 300 feet (90&nbsp;m) from reaching the harbour, resulting in falling trade.[56] The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.[57] Some of the traditional industries including copper and brass manufacture went into decline,[58] but the import and processing of tobacco flourished with the expansion of the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills business.[59]</p><p>Supported by new industry and growing commerce, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801), quintupled during the 19th century,[60] resulting in the creation of new suburbs such as Clifton and Cotham. These provide architectural examples from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and at right angles to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic medieval gothic style appeared, partially as a reaction against the symmetry of Palladianism, and can be seen in buildings such as the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery,[61] the Royal West of England Academy,[62] and The Victoria Rooms.[63] Riots broke out in 1793[64] and 1831; the first over the renewal of tolls on Bristol Bridge, and the second against the rejection of the second Reform Bill by the House of Lords.[65] The Diocese of Bristol had undergone several boundary changes by 1897 when it was reconstituted into the configuration which has lasted into the 21st century.[66]</p><br><img alt="An old ordnance survey map of Bristol, showing roads, railways, rivers and contours." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Bristol_map_1946.jpg/220px-Bristol_map_1946.jpg" width="220" height="204"><br><p>A 1946 map of Bristol</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>20th century[edit]</h3><p>From a population of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971.[67] Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock.[68] Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s.[69] As air travel grew in the first half of the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories.[70]</p><p>Bristol was heavily damaged by Luftwaffe raids during World War II; about 1,300 people living or working in the city were killed and nearly 100,000 buildings were damaged, at least 3,000 beyond repair.[71][72] The original central market area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed churches and fragments of the castle. A third bomb-damaged church nearby, St Nicholas, has been restored and is a museum housing a 1756 William Hogarth triptych painted for the high altar of St Mary Redcliffe. The museum also has statues of King Edward I (moved from Arno's Court Triumphal Arch) and King Edward III (taken from Lawfords' Gate in the city walls when they were demolished about 1760), and 13th-century statues of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (builder of Bristol Castle)[73] and Geoffrey de Montbray (who built the city's walls) from Bristol's Newgate.[74]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg/220px-Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Ambrose Road, in the Cliftonwood neighbourhood</p><p>The rebuilding of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead shopping area regenerated, and one of the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished.[75] Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).[76]</p><p>The 20th century relocation of the docks to Avonmouth Docks and Royal Portbury Dock, 7 miles (11&nbsp;km) downstream from the city centre, has allowed the redevelopment of the old dock area (the Floating Harbour).[77] Although the docks' existence was once in jeopardy (since the area was seen as a derelict industrial site), the inaugural 1996 International Festival of the Sea held in and around the docks affirmed the area as a leisure asset of the city.[78]</p><h2>Government[edit]</h2><br><img alt="A large brick building, built in a shallow curve, with a central porch.

Main article: Politics of Bristol</p><p>Bristol City council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards,[79] with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held in three years out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election.[80] Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong in the city and (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.[81]</p><p>In February 2009, the Labour group resigned and the Liberal Democrats took office with a minority administration.[82] In the 4 June 2009 council elections the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council.[83] In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6.[84] In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which a third of the city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7&nbsp;seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2&nbsp;to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.[85]</p><p>These trends were continued into the next election in May 2014, in which Labour gained three seats to take their total to 31, the Green Party won two more seats, the Conservative party gained one seat, and UKIP won their first-ever seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats lost a further seven seats.[86]</p><p>On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a referendum on the question of a directly elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a directly elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012, and Independent candidate George Ferguson became Mayor of Bristol.[87]</p><p>The Lord Mayor of Bristol, not to be confused with the Mayor of Bristol, is a figurehead elected each May by the city council. Councillor Faruk Choudhury was selected by his fellow councillors for the position in 2013. At 38, he was the youngest person to serve as Lord Mayor of Bristol and the first Muslim elected to the office.[88]</p><p>Bristol constituencies in the House of Commons also included parts of other local authority areas until the 2010 general election, when their boundaries were aligned with the county boundary. The city is divided into Bristol West, East, South and North West.[89] Since the 2015 election, the city has had three Labour members of parliament (MPs) and one Conservative.[90]</p><p>The city has a tradition of political activism. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that he was a member of parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second.[91][92] Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol,[93] and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83.[94] In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act.[95] The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the social and economic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of fair trade was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.[96]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol is both a city and a county, since Edward III granted it a county charter in 1373.[22] The county was expanded in 1835 to include suburbs such as Clifton, and it was named a county borough in 1889 when that designation was introduced.[24] On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon.[97] The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.[98]</p><h2>Geography and environment[edit]</h2><h3>Boundaries[edit]</h3><p>See also: Subdivisions of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Suspension bridge between two brick built towers, over a wooded gorge, showing mud and water at the bottom.

The narrowest definition of the city is the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.[99]</p><p>A slightly broader definition used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol but outside the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary.[100] The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano.[101] The North Fringe of Bristol, a developed area in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named as part of a 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.[102]</p><h3>Greater Bristol[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Greater Bristol</p><p>The term Greater Bristol, used by the Government Office of the South West (now abolished), the Office for National Statistics and others,[103] refers to the city and portions of the three neighbouring local authorities?—?Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire?—?an area sometimes called the former Avon area or the West of England Partnership (WEP) area. Greater Bristol does not include Bath or Weston-super-Mare, which are included in the WEP area.[104] The Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways (FOSBR) conflates the terms Greater Bristol and Suburban Bristol.[105]</p><br><img alt="Rocky side to a gorge with a platform in front of a cave halfway up.

The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.[107]</p><p>The gorge, which helped protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone to build the city, and its surrounding land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.[107]</p><h3>Climate[edit]</h3><p>Located in southern England, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK with a mean annual temperature of approximately 10.5&nbsp;°C (50.9&nbsp;°F).[108][109] It is among the sunniest, with 1,541–1,885&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.[110] Although the city is partially sheltered by the Mendip Hills, it is exposed to the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel. Annual rainfall increases from north to south, with totals north of the Avon in the 600–900&nbsp;mm (24–35&nbsp;in) range and 900–1,200&nbsp;mm (35–47&nbsp;in) south of the river.[111] Rain is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with autumn and winter the wetter seasons. The Atlantic Ocean influences Bristol's weather, keeping its average temperature above freezing throughout the year, but winter frosts are frequent and snow occasionally falls from early November to late April. Summers are warm and drier, with variable sunshine, rain and clouds, and spring weather is unsettled.[112]</p><p>The weather stations nearest Bristol for which long-term climate data are available are Long Ashton (about 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) south west of the city centre) and Bristol Weather Station, in the city centre. Data collection at these locations ended in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and Filton Airfield is currently the nearest weather station to the city.[113] Temperatures at Long Ashton from 1959 to 2002 ranged from 33.5&nbsp;°C (92.3&nbsp;°F) in July 1976[114] to -14.4&nbsp;°C (6.1&nbsp;°F) in January 1982.[115] Monthly high temperatures since 2002 at Filton exceeding those recorded at Long Ashton include 25.7&nbsp;°C (78.3&nbsp;°F) in April 2003,[116] 34.5&nbsp;°C (94.1&nbsp;°F) in July 2006[117] and 26.8&nbsp;°C (80.2&nbsp;°F) in October 2011.[118] The lowest recent temperature at Filton was -10.1&nbsp;°C (13.8&nbsp;°F) in December 2010.[119] Although large cities in general experience an urban heat island effect, with warmer temperatures than their surrounding rural areas, this phenomenon is minimal in Bristol.[120]</p><h3>Environment[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Environment in Bristol</p><p>Bristol was ranked as Britain's most-sustainable city (based on its environmental performance, quality of life, future-proofing and approaches to climate change, recycling and biodiversity), topping environmental charity Forum for the Future's 2008 Sustainable Cities Index.[123][124] Local initiatives include Sustrans (creators of the National Cycle Network, founded as Cyclebag in 1977)[125] and Resourcesaver, a non-profit business established in 1988 by Avon Friends of the Earth.[126] In 2014 The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live.[127] The city received the 2015 European Green Capital Award, becoming the first UK city to receive this award.[128]</p><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Demography of Bristol</p><p>In 2014, the Office for National Statistics estimated the Bristol unitary authority's population at 442,474,[133][134] making it the 43rd-largest ceremonial county in England.[134] The ONS, using Census 2001 data, estimated the city's population at 441,556[135] and that of the contiguous urban area at 551,066.[136] In 2006 the ONS estimated Bristol's urban-area population at 587,400,[137] making it England's sixth-most-populous city and ninth-most-populous urban area.[136] At 3,599 inhabitants per square kilometre (9,321/sq&nbsp;mi) it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district.[138]</p><p>According to the 2011 census, 84% of the population was White (77.9% White British, 0.9% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Travellers and 5.1% Other White); 3.6% mixed-race (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% Asian (1.5% Indian, 1.6% Pakistani, 0.5% Bangladeshi, 0.9% Chinese and one percent other Asian); 6% Black (2.8% African, 1.6% Caribbean, 1.6% Other Black), 0.3% Arab and 0.6% with other heritage. Bristol is unusual among major British towns and cities in its larger black than Asian population.[139] These statistics apply to the Bristol Unitary Authority area, excluding areas of the urban area (2006 estimated population 587,400) in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) and North Somerset—such as Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Filton and Warmley.[67] 56.2% of the 209,995 Bristol Residents who are employed commute to work using either a car, van, motorbike or Taxi. While 2.2% commute by rail and 9.8% by bus, 19.6% walk.[140]</p><h2>Economy and industry[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Economy of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Two ornate metal pillars with large dishes on top in a paved street, with an eighteenth-century stone building behind, upon which can be seen the words &quot;Tea Blenders Estabklishec 177-&quot;.

Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products.[142] Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.[143][144]</p><p>Ships occasionally departed Bristol for Iceland as early as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot.[20] Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities.[20] In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.[145]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>By 1670 the city had 6,000&nbsp;tons of shipping (of which half was imported tobacco), and by the late 17th and early 18th centuries shipping played a significant role in the slave trade.[20] During the 18th century, Bristol was Britain's second-busiest port;[146] business was conducted in the trading area around The Exchange in Corn Street over bronze tables known as Nails. Although the Nails are cited as originating the phrase cash on the nail (immediate payment), the phrase was probably in use before their installation.[147]</p><p>The city's economy also relies on the aerospace, defence, media, information technology, financial services and tourism industries.[148][149] The Ministry of Defence (MoD)'s Procurement Executive, later known as the Defence Procurement Agency and Defence Equipment and Support, moved to its headquarters to Abbey Wood, Filton, in 1995. This organisation, with a staff of 7,000 to 8,000, procures and supports MoD equipment.[150] One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top-ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness guides for young adults.[151]</p><p>Bristol is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group, and is ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, the fourth highest ranked English city.[152] In 2014 Bristol's gross domestic product was £30.502&nbsp;billion.[153][154] Its per capita GDP was £46,000 ($65,106, €57,794), which was some 65% above the national average, the third highest of any English city (after London and Nottingham) and the sixth highest of any city in the United Kingdom (behind London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Nottingham).[153] Bristol's March 2007 unemployment rate was 4.8%, compared with four percent for South West England and the national average of 5.5%.[155]</p><p>Although Bristol's economy no longer relies upon its port, which was moved to docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s[156] and to the Royal Portbury Dock in 1977 as ship size increased, it is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330&nbsp;million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9&nbsp;million long tons (4&nbsp;million tonnes) to 11.8&nbsp;million (12&nbsp;million).[157] Tobacco importing and cigarette manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.[158]</p><p>The financial services sector employs 59,000 in the city,[159] and 50 micro-electronics and silicon design companies employ about 5,000. In 1983 Hewlett-Packard opened its national research laboratory in Bristol.[160][161] In 2014 the city was ranked seventh in the top 10 UK destinations by TripAdvisor.[162]</p><p>During the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at Filton by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later Rolls-Royce) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I Bristol Fighter[163] and World War II Blenheim and Beaufighter planes.[163] During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the Freighter, Britannia and Brabazon. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, luxury Bristol Cars at their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960.[164] The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.[165]</p><br><img alt="A view from below of an aeroplane in flight, with a slender fuselage and swept back wings." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg/220px-Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="157"><br><p>Final Concorde flight on 26 November 2003, shortly before landing on the Filton runway.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>The climate of the area is tropical to subtropical in Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Rainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents (cool upwellings keep the ABC islands arid). Warm, moist trade winds blow consistently from the east creating rain forest /semi desert divisions on mountainous islands. Occasional north westerlies affect the northern islands in the winter. The region enjoys year-round sunshine, divided into 'dry' and 'wet' seasons, with the latter six months of the year being wetter than the first half.</p><p>Hurricane season is from June to November, but they occur more frequently in August and September and more common in the northern islands of the Caribbean. Hurricanes that sometimes batter the region usually strike northwards of Grenada and to the west of Barbados. The principal hurricane belt arcs to northwest of the island of Barbados in the Eastern Caribbean.</p><p>Water temperatures vary from 31&nbsp;°C (88&nbsp;°F) to 22&nbsp;°C (72&nbsp;°F) all around the year. The air temperature is warm, in the 20s and 30s °C (70s, 80s and 90s °F) during the year, only varies from winter to summer about 2–5 degrees on the southern islands and about 10–20 degrees difference can occur in the northern islands of the Caribbean.

Main article: List of islands in the Caribbean
See also: Caribbean South America and Caribbean basin</p><h3>Continental countries with Caribbean coastlines and islands[edit]</h3><h2>Biodiversity[edit]</h2><p>The Caribbean islands are remarkable for the diversity of their animals, fungi and plants, and have been classified as one of Conservation International's biodiversity hotspots because of their exceptionally diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems, ranging from montane cloud forests to cactus scrublands. The region also contains about 8% (by surface area) of the world's coral reefs[25] along with extensive seagrass meadows,[26] both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering the island and continental coasts of the region.</p><p>For the fungi, there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90,000 records derived from specimens in reference collections, published accounts and field observations.[27] That checklist includes more than 11250 species of fungi recorded from the region. As its authors note, the work is far from exhaustive, and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the Caribbean is higher. The true total number of fungal species occurring in the Caribbean, including species not yet recorded, is likely far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have been discovered.[28] Though the amount of available information is still small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to some Caribbean islands. For Cuba, 2200 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the island;[29] for Puerto Rico, the number is 789 species;[30] for the Dominican Republic, the number is 699 species;[31] for Trinidad and Tobago, the number is 407 species.[32]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Many of the ecosystems of the Caribbean islands have been devastated by deforestation, pollution, and human encroachment. The arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of giant owls and dwarf ground sloths.[33] The hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals (ranging from birds, to mammals and reptiles), fungi and plants. Examples of threatened animals include the Puerto Rican amazon, two species of solenodon (giant shrews) in Cuba and the Hispaniola island, and the Cuban crocodile.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Isla_Saona.jpg/750px-Isla_Saona.jpg" width="750" height="159"><p>Saona Island, Dominican Republic</p><p>The region's coral reefs, which contain about 70 species of hard corals and between 500–700 species of reef-associated fishes[34] have undergone rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in recent years, and are considered particularly vulnerable to global warming and ocean acidification.[35] According to a UNEP report, the Caribbean coral reefs might get extinct in next 20 years due to population explosion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas and global warming.[36]</p><p>Some Caribbean islands have terrain that Europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture. Tobacco was an important early crop during the colonial era, but was eventually overtaken by sugarcane production as the region's staple crop. Sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to Europe. Cuba and Barbados were historically the largest producers of sugar. The tropical plantation system thus came to dominate Caribbean settlement. Other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for agriculture, for example Dominica, which remains heavily forested. The islands in the southern Lesser Antilles, Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, are extremely arid, making them unsuitable for agriculture. However, they have salt pans that were exploited by the Dutch.

The population of the Caribbean is estimated to have been around 750,000 immediately before European contact, although lower and higher figures are given. After contact, social disruption and epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles (to which they had no natural immunity)[39] led to a decline in the Amerindian population.[40] From 1500 to 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from West Africa[41] such as the Kongo, Igbo, Akan, Fon and Yoruba as well as military prisoners from Ireland, who were deported during the Cromwellian reign in England.[citation needed] Immigrants from Britain, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark also arrived, although the mortality rate was high for both groups.[42]</p><p>The population is estimated to have reached 2.2 million by 1800.[43] Immigrants from India, China, Indonesia, and other countries arrived in the mid-19th century as indentured servants.[44] After the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, the population increased naturally.[45] The total regional population was estimated at 37.5 million by 2000.[46]</p><p>The majority of the Caribbean has populations of mainly Africans in the French Caribbean, Anglophone Caribbean and Dutch Caribbean, there are minorities of mixed-race (including Mulatto-Creole, Dougla, Mestizo, Quadroon, Cholo, Castizo, Criollo, Zambo, Pardo, Asian Latin Americans, Chindian, Cocoa panyols, and Eurasian); and European people of Spanish, Dutch, English, French, Italian, and Portuguese ancestry. Asians, especially those of Chinese, Indian descent, and Javenese Indonesians, form a significant minority in the region and also contribute to multiracial communities. Indians form a majority of the population in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Most of their ancestors arrived in the 19th century as indentured laborers.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Spanish-speaking Caribbean have primarily mixed race, African, or European majorities. Puerto Rico has a European majority with a mixture of European-African-Native American (tri-racial), and a large Mulatto (European-West African) and West African minority. One third of Cuba's (largest Caribbean island) population is of African descent, with a sizable Mulatto (mixed African–European) population, and European majority.

This is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured laborers, and migration. Most multi-racial Jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or brown. Similar populations can be found in the Caricom states of Belize, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago has a multi-racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrivals of Africans, Indians, Chinese, Arabs, Jews, Spanish, Portuguese, and Europeans along with the Native Amerindians population. This multi-racial mix has created sub-ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include Dougla, Chindian, Mulatto-Creole, Afro-Asians, Eurasian, Cocoa panyols, and Asian Latin Americans</p><h3>Indigenous groups[edit]</h3><h3>Language[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Languages of the Caribbean</p><p>Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Haitian Creole, Antillean Creole French, and Papiamento are the predominant official languages of various countries in the region, though a handful of unique creole languages or dialects can also be found from one country to another.

Regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems. From a political and economic perspective, regionalism serves to make Caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions. In 1973, the first political regionalism in the Caribbean Basin was created by advances of the English-speaking Caribbean nations through the institution known as the Caribbean Common Market and Community (CARICOM)[49] which is located in Guyana.</p><p>Certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the Caribbean. On the one hand the Caribbean states are politically diverse, ranging from communist systems such as Cuba toward more capitalist Westminster-style parliamentary systems as in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other scholars argue that these differences are superficial, and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various Caribbean states. Contemporary Caribbean systems seem to reflect a blending of traditional and modern patterns, yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways.[50] The political systems of the Caribbean states share similar practices.</p><p>The influence of regionalism in the Caribbean is often marginalized. Some scholars believe that regionalism cannot exist in the Caribbean because each small state is unique. On the other hand, scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the Caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists. Proximity as well as historical ties among the Caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action.[51] These attempts at regionalization reflect the nations' desires to compete in the international economic system.[51]</p><p>Furthermore, a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region. In recent years the Caribbean has suffered from a lack of U.S. interest. With the end of the Cold War, U.S. security and economic interests have been focused on other areas. As a result there has been a significant reduction in U.S. aid and investment to the Caribbean.[52] The lack of international support for these small, relatively poor states, helped regionalism prosper.</p><p>Following the Cold War another issue of importance in the Caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some Caribbean States due to the United States and European Union's allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other. [clarification needed]</p><p>United States effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The United States under President Bill Clinton launched a challenge in the World Trade Organization against the EU over Europe's preferential program, known as the Lomé Convention, which allowed banana exports from the former colonies of the Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) to enter Europe cheaply.[53] The World Trade Organization sided in the United States' favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to African, Caribbean and Pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the Cotonou Agreement.[54]</p><p>During the US/EU dispute, the United States imposed large tariffs on European Union goods (up to 100%) to pressure Europe to change the agreement with the Caribbean nations in favour of the Cotonou Agreement.[55]</p><p>Farmers in the Caribbean have complained of falling profits and rising costs as the Lomé Convention weakens. Some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of illegal drugs, which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these illegal drugs in North America and Europe.[56][57]</p><p>Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and Association of Caribbean States[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry. One of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the Caribbean Basin has been the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Proposed by CARICOM in 1992, the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region. It was founded in July 1994. The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues unique to the Caribbean Basin. Through coalition building, like the ACS and CARICOM, regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean. The successes of region-building initiatives are still debated by scholars, yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean.</p><p>Venezuela's effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez launched an economic group called the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), which several eastern Caribbean islands joined. In 2012, the nation of Haiti, with 9 million people, became the largest CARICOM nation that sought to join the union.[58]</p><h2>Regional institutions[edit]</h2><p>Here are some of the bodies that several islands share in collaboration:</p><h2>Cuisine[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Caribbean cuisine</p><h3>Favorite or national dishes[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg/220px-FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Doubles, one of the national dishes of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Arroz_con_gandules.jpg/220px-Arroz_con_gandules.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Arroz con gandules, one of the national dishes of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Geography:</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Find more aboutCaribbeanat Wikipedia's sister projects</p><p>Coordinates: 14°31'32?N 75°49'06?W? / ?14.52556°N 75.81833°W? / 14.52556; -75.81833</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

The term Amerindian (short for 'Indians of the Americas) is used in Quebec, the Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean.[24][25][26][27] In Brazil, indígenas or povos indígenas are common if formal-sounding designations, while índio is still the more often-heard term (the noun for the Indian nationality being indiano), and aborígene and nativo being rarely used in Amerindian-specific contexts (e.g. aborígene is usually understood as the ethnonym for Indigenous Australians). Indigenous peoples are commonly known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples, which includes not only First Nations and Arctic Inuit, but also the minority population of First Nations-European mixed-race Métis people[28] who identify culturally and ethnically with indigenous peoplehood. This is contrasted, for instance, to the American Indian-European mixed-race mestizos of Hispanic America (caboclos in Brazil) who, with their larger population (in most Latin American countries constituting either outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities), identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both Europeans and Indigenous Americans, but still considering themselves a subset of the European-derived Hispanic or Brazilian peoplehood in culture and ethnicity (cf. ladinos).</p><p>Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians, and Alaska Natives.[29]</p><p>Application of the term Indian originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies.[30][31][32][33][34][35] Eventually, those islands came to be known as the West Indies, a name still used. This led to the blanket term Indies and Indians (Spanish indios, Portuguese índios) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced by many over the last two centuries.[citation needed] Even though the term Indian generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas—such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years ago, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East—these groups are nonetheless considered indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Portuguese and Spanish equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, indios filipinos.</p><p>Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.[36] Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting, and gathering. In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, chiefdoms, states, and empires.</p><p>Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Greenland, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guaraní, Mayan languages, and Nahuatl, count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, social organization, and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects, but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from Western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples.</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>History[edit]</h2><h3>Migration into the continents[edit]</h3><p>For more details on theories of the migrations of the Paleo-Indians, see settlement of the Americas.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg/200px-Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg" width="200" height="126"><br><p>Illustration of Paleo-Indians hunting a glyptodont</p><p>The specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are the subject of ongoing research and discussion.[37][38] According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.[37] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of Beringia that joined Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska).[39][40] Alaska was a glacial refugium because it had low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of North America, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.[41][42]</p><p>Indigenous genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia.[43][44] The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10–20,000 years.[45][46][47] Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.[38][48][49] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets.[50]</p><p>Another route proposed involves migration – either on foot or using primitive boats – along the Pacific Northwest coast to the south, including as far as South America.[51] Archeological evidence of the latter would have been covered by the sea level rise of more than 120 meters since the last ice age.[52]</p><p>The time range of 40,000–16,500 years ago is debatable and probably will remain so for years to come.[37][38] The few agreements achieved to date include:[53][54]</p><p>Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Archaeologists and anthropologists have studied differences among these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods.[56] The Clovis culture, the earliest definitively-dated Paleo-Indians in the Americas, appears around 11,500 RCBP (radiocarbon years Before Present[57]), equivalent to 13,500 to 13,000 calendar years ago.</p><p>In 2014, the autosomal DNA was sequenced of a 12,500+-year-old infant from Montana, whose remains were found in close association with several Clovis artifacts.[58] These are the Anzick-1 remains from the Anzick Clovis burial in Montana. The data indicate that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America. Hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas were ruled out.[58] After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named 'Naia' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called sistema Sac Actun in Mexico's eastern Yucatán Peninsula. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.[59]</p><p>Pre-Columbian era[edit]

Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant European and African arrivals (ca. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through oral history and through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period, and were documented in historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, and Nahua peoples, had their own written languages and records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs, and burned many pre-Columbian written records. Only a few documents remained hidden and survived, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations before and at the time of European encounter had achieved great complexity and many accomplishments.[64] For instance, the Aztecs built one of the largest cities in the world, Tenochtitlan, the ancient site of Mexico City, with an estimated population of 200,000. American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics. The domestication of maize or corn required thousands of years of selective breeding, and continued cultivation of multiple varieties was done with planning and selection, generally by women.</p><p>Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and American Indian creation myths tell of a variety of origins of their respective peoples. Some were always there or were created by gods or animals, some migrated from a specified compass point, and others came from across the ocean.[65]</p><h3>European colonization[edit]</h3><p>Main article: European colonization of the Americas
See also: Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas and Columbian Exchange</p><br><br><p>Cultural areas of North America at time of European contact</p><p>The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the native peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera, which the early explorers brought from Europe and which spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. Conflicts between colonists and indigenous people exacerbated the loss of lives. Colonists frequently[quantify] perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.[66][67][68] According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.[69]</p><p>The first indigenous group encountered by Columbus, the 250,000 Taínos of Hispaniola, represented the dominant culture in the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Within thirty years about 70% of the Taínos had died.[70] They had no immunity to European diseases, so outbreaks of measles and smallpox ravaged their population.[71] Increasing punishment of the Taínos for revolting against forced labour, despite measures put in place by the encomienda, which included religious education and protection from warring tribes,[72] eventually led to the last great Taíno rebellion (1511–1529).</p><p>Following years of mistreatment, the Taínos began to adopt suicidal behaviors, with women aborting or killing their infants and men jumping from cliffs or ingesting untreated cassava, a violent poison.[70] Eventually, a Taíno Cacique named Enriquillo managed to hold out in the Baoruco Mountain Range for thirteen years, causing serious damage to the Spanish, Carib-held plantations and their Indian auxiliaries.[73][not in citation given] Hearing of the seriousness of the revolt, Emperor Charles V (also King of Spain) sent captain Francisco Barrionuevo to negotiate a peace treaty with the ever-increasing number of rebels. Two months later, after consultation with the Audencia of Santo Domingo, Enriquillo was offered any part of the island to live in peace.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in America, particularly with regard to native Indians.

Scholars[which?] now[when?] believe that, among the various contributing factors, epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives.[75][76] Some[quantify] believe that after first contacts with Europeans and Africans, Old World diseases caused the deaths of 90 to 95% of the native population of the New World in the following 150 years.[77] Smallpox killed up to one third of the native population of Hispaniola in 1518.[78] By killing the Incan ruler Huayna Capac, smallpox caused the Inca Civil War of 1529–1532. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Typhus (probably) in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, measles in 1618—all ravaged the remains of Inca culture.</p><p>Smallpox killed millions of native inhabitants of Mexico.[79][80] Unintentionally introduced at Veracruz with the arrival of Pánfilo de Narváez on April 23, 1520, smallpox ravaged Mexico in the 1520s,[81] possibly killing over 150,000 in Tenochtitlán (the heartland of the Aztec Empire) alone, and aiding in the victory of Hernán Cortés over the Aztec Empire at Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City) in 1521.[citation needed]</p><p>Over the centuries the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous Americans had no immunity.[82]</p><p>Exploration of the Caribbean led to the discovery of the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles.

As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population-groups of Native Americans.[86] It reached Lake Ontario in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679.[87][88] During the 1770s smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.[89] The 1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic and the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic brought devastation and drastic population depletion among the Plains Indians.[90][91] In 1832 the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans (The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832).[92][93]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The indigenous peoples in Brazil declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated three million[94] to some 300,000 in 1997.[dubious – discuss][not in citation given][95]</p><p>The Spanish Empire and other Europeans re-introduced horses to the Americas. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.[96] The re-introduction of the horse, extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on Native American culture in the Great Plains of North America and in Patagonia in South America. By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture game, especially bison.</p><h2>Agriculture[edit]</h2><p>See also: Agriculture in Mesoamerica and Incan agriculture</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Buffalo_Hunt.jpg/220px-Buffalo_Hunt.jpg" width="220" height="153"><br><p>A bison hunt depicted by George Catlin</p><p>Over time and thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[97] In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.</p><p>The South American highlands were a center of early agriculture. Genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern Peru,[98] from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex. Over 99% of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south-central Chile,[99] Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago.[100][101] According to George Raudzens, It is clear that in pre-Columbian times some groups struggled to survive and often suffered food shortages and famines, while others enjoyed a varied and substantial diet.[102] The persistent drought around 850 AD coincided with the collapse of Classic Maya civilization, and the famine of One Rabbit (AD 1454) was a major catastrophe in Mexico.[103]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg/220px-Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg" width="220" height="148"><br><p>Andenes in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Peru.

Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.[104]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the Mississippi River valley, Europeans noted Native Americans' managed groves of nut and fruit trees not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields.

Chief among these is maize or corn, arguably the most important crop in the world.[106] Other significant crops include cassava, chia, squash (pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, acorn squash, butternut squash), the pinto bean, Phaseolus beans including most common beans, tepary beans and lima beans, tomatoes, potatoes, avocados, peanuts, cocoa beans (used to make chocolate), vanilla, strawberries, pineapples, Peppers (species and varieties of Capsicum, including bell peppers, jalapeños, paprika and chili peppers) sunflower seeds, rubber, brazilwood, chicle, tobacco, coca, manioc and some species of cotton.</p><p>Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management, including agro-forestry practices among Itza Maya in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the Menominee of Wisconsin, suggest that longstanding sacred values may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.[107]</p><h2>Culture[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Quechuawomanandchild.jpg/220px-Quechuawomanandchild.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Andes, Peru</p><p>Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a cultural area is Mesoamerica, where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><p>The languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area. Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the Chippewas and Delawares.[108]</p><h3>Writing systems[edit]</h3><p>See also: Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, Cherokee syllabary, and Quipu</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg/220px-Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg" width="220" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in Palenque, Mexico</p><p>The development of writing is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block. The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane.[109]</p><p>The Maya writing system was a combination of phonetic syllabic symbols and logograms—that is, it was a logosyllabic writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different glyphs, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.[110][111][112]</p><p>The Zapotec writing system is one of the earliest writing systems in the Americas.[113] The oldest example of the Zapotec script is a monument discovered in San José Mogote, dating from around from 600 BCE.[114] Zapotec writing was logographic and presumably syllabic.[113] The remains of the Zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture. There are only a few extant inscriptions, which makes study of this writing system difficult.</p><p>Aztec codices (singular codex) are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era Aztecs. These codices provide some of the best primary sources for Aztec culture. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.[115] The colonial era codices not only contain Aztec pictograms, but also Classical Nahuatl (in the Latin alphabet), Spanish, and occasionally Latin.</p><p>Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there is a large number of local-level documents in Nahuatl, Zapotec, Mixtec, and Yucatec Maya from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.[116] The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the New Philology to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.[117]</p><p>The Wiigwaasabak, birch bark scrolls on which the Ojibwa (Anishinaabe) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics.</p><p>Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply syllabics, is a family of abugidas used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the Algonquian, Inuit, and Athabaskan language families.</p><h3>Music and art[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas and Native American music</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg/220px-Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg" width="220" height="367"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Apache fiddle made by Chesley Goseyun Wilson (San Carlos Apache)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Gorget%2C_Peru%2C_north_coast%2C_Chimu_style%2C_c._1350-1450_AD%2C_feathers%2C_reeds%2C_copper_bars%2C_silver%2C_metal_overlaid_with_skin_-_Textile_Museum%2C_George_Washington_University_-_DSC09898.JPG/220px-thumbnail.jpg" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Chimu culture feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350–1450 CE</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/JuPi_1.jpg/220px-JuPi_1.jpg" width="220" height="313"><br><p>Textile art by Julia Pingushat (Inuk, Arviat, Nunavut Territory, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995</p><p>Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.[citation needed]</p><p>The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often pentatonic. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and wind instruments such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and rain tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European musical instruments; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.[118][dead link]</p><p>Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas comprise a major category in the world art collection. Contributions include pottery, paintings, jewellery, weavings, sculptures, basketry, carvings, and beadwork.[119] Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives[120] in order to profit from the cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe. To support the ongoing practice of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States,[121] the Ford Foundation, arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.[122][123]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png/220px-Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png" width="220" height="234"><br><p>This map shows the percentage of indigenous population in different countries of the Americas.</p><p>The following table provides estimates for each country in the Americas of the populations of indigenous people and those with partial indigenous ancestry, each expressed as a percentage of the overall population.

They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of empowered caciques to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.[153] While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged people identifying as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s.[154] Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted grassroots territorial organizations; these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas.</p><p>Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Muisca were the largest native civilization geographically between the Incas and the Aztecs empires.</p><h3>Costa Rica[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica</p><p>There are over 114,000 inhabitants of Native American origins, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (In the Central Valley), Matambú or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (Northern Alajuela), Bribri (Southern Atlantic), Cabécar (Cordillera de Talamanca), Guaymí (Southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), Boruca (Southern Costa Rica) and Ngäbe (Southern Costa Rica).</p><p>These native groups are characterized for their work in wood, like masks, drums and other artistic figures, as well as fabrics made of cotton.</p><p>Their subsistence is based on agriculture, having corn, beans and plantains as the main crops.</p><h3>Cuba[edit]</h3><p>In Cuba, the population of Amerindians includes 0.1 of the population and 0.2 part Native which is also part of the population. Many are from the Taíno people or Arawak people. When the Spanish Empire was in control of the island they used the Natives as slaves and many died from diseases, hence decreasing the population. Presently 0.3 of the population of Cuba consists of part Native and full-blooded Amerindians.</p><h3>Dominica[edit]</h3><p>Dominica is home to the Carib Territory, one of the last indigenous communities in the Caribbean.

An early sedentary culture, known as the Valdivia culture, developed in the coastal region, while the Caras and the Quitus unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The Cañaris near Cuenca were the most advanced, and most feared by the Inca, due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/EquateurOtavalo_0606.jpg/150px-EquateurOtavalo_0606.jpg" width="150" height="225"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Otavalo girl from Ecuador</p><p>Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region.

Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as mitimaes.</p><p>Coastal groups, including the Awá, Chachi, and the Tsáchila, make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the Shuar, the Huaorani, the Siona-Secoya, the Cofán, and the Achuar.</p><p>In 1986, indigenous people formed the first truly national political organization. The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) has been the primary political institution of the Indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation.

The Pipil lived in western El Salvador, spoke Nawat, and had many settlements there, most noticeably Cuzcatlan. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and fertile land that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other lands like Guatemala or Mexico, but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by Pedro de Alvarado along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people. Today many Pipil and other indigenous populations live in the many small towns of El Salvador like Izalco, Panchimalco, Sacacoyo, and Nahuizalco.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Guatemala[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Demographics of Guatemala</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Guat%C3%A9mala_78.jpg/220px-Guat%C3%A9mala_78.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Maya women from Guatemala</p><p>Most of the indigenous peoples of Guatemala are of Maya heritage.

				This article is about the continent. For the politico-economic union, see European Union. For other uses, see Europe (disambiguation).</p><p>Europe —a concept dating back to classical antiquity— is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The eastern boundary with Asia is an arbitrary historical and social construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. The primarily physiographic term continent as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities and lines of demarcation are not reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries with Asia. Europe is considered by historical convention as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.[5]</p><p>Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 740&nbsp;million (about 11% of world population) as of 2015[update].[6] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.</p><p>Europe, in particular ancient Greece, was the birthplace of Western civilization.[7][8][9] The fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the migration period, marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. From the Age of Discovery onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the majority of Asia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[10] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>In 1955, the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all states except for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Vatican City. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation.[11] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The European Anthem is Ode to Joy and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Name</h2><p>Further information: Europa (mythology)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Herodotus_World_Map.jpg/330px-Herodotus_World_Map.jpg" width="330" height="193"><br><p>Reconstruction of Herodotus' world map (450 BC)</p><p>In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient&nbsp;Greek: ????p?, Eur?pe) is the name of either a Phoenician princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements e???? (eurús), wide, broad[12] and ?? (ops, gen. ?p??, opós) eye, face, countenance,[13] hence their composite Eur?pe would mean wide-gazing or broad of aspect. Broad has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[14] For the second part compare also the divine attributes of grey-eyed Athena (??a???p??, glaukopis) or ox-eyed Hera (ß??p??, boopis).</p><p>There have been attempts to connect Eur?pe to a Semitic term for west, this being either Akkadian erebu meaning to go down, set (said of the sun) or Phoenician 'ereb evening, west,[15] which is at the origin of Arabic Maghreb and Hebrew ma'arav. Michael A. Barry, professor in Princeton University's Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of night, [the country of] sunset, in opposition to Asu [the country of] sunrise, i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to cartographic convention appears in Greek ??at??? (Anatol? [sun] rise, east, hence Anatolia).[16] Martin Litchfield West stated that phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor.[17] Next to these hypotheses there is also a Proto-Indo-European root *h1reg?os, meaning darkness, which also produced Greek Erebus.</p><p>Most major world languages use words derived from Eur?pe or Europa to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word Ouzhou (??/??); a similar Chinese-derived term Oshu (??) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, Oshu Rengo (????), despite the katakana Yoroppa (?????) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan (land of the Franks) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa.[18]</p><h2>Definition</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Further information: List of transcontinental countries and Boundaries between continents</p><h3>Contemporary definition</h3><p>Clickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[19]

Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.[20]</p><p>Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Europe as used specifically in British English may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[22]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>A medieval T and O map from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah — Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham)</p><p>The first recorded usage of Eur?pe as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC.[23] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[24] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[25] The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[26]</p><p>The convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[27] Strabo[28] and Ptolemy,[29] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.</p><p>The term Europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.</p><p>A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[30] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: Europa often[dubious – discuss] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[31]</p><p>Modern definitions

But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.</p><p>Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains.[32] introducing the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard.[33]</p><p>The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[34][35] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.</p><p>By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.[36]</p><p>In Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[37] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[38] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[39] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest[40] and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Europe</p><h3>Prehistory</h3><p>Main article: Prehistoric Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lascaux_painting.jpg/260px-Lascaux_painting.jpg" width="260" height="170"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c 15,000 BC)</p><p>Homo erectus georgicus, which lived roughly 1.8&nbsp;million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe.[41] Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1&nbsp;million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[42] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and their final refuge being present-day Portugal.

Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[45] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic.

Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[51] The Greeks city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[51] In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[52] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[53] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[54][55][56] In the course of the 5th century BC, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[57] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/RomanEmpire_117.svg/260px-RomanEmpire_117.svg.png" width="260" height="191"><br><p>The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg/170px-Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg" width="170" height="246"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Augustus wearing the Civic Crown</p><p>Greece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[51] Expanding from their base in Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BC, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe.[58]</p><p>The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[59][60] The Empire began to decline in the 3rd century, particularly in the west. Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 AD after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople in his honour (modern-day Istanbul) in 330 AD. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 AD, and in 391-392 AD, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[61] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 AD;[62] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century AD.</p><p>Main articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages

There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars.[58] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the Dark Ages.[63] Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[64]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia, and brought the Christian church under state control.[65]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Rolandfealty.jpg/160px-Rolandfealty.jpg" width="160" height="178"><p>Roland pledges fealty to Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Delegation_of_Croats_and_Serbs_to_Emperor_Basil_I%2C_Skylitzes.jpg/160px-Delegation_of_Croats_and_Serbs_to_Emperor_Basil_I%2C_Skylitzes.jpg" width="160" height="79"><p>Delegations of Croats and Serbs at Byzantine court of Basil I</p><p>From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[66] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[67] Between 711 and 720, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule&nbsp;— save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance.</p><p>During the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.[68] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis&nbsp;I.[69] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[70]</p><p>East Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[71][72] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[73]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>High and Late Middle Ages</h3><p>Main articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages

Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.[74] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament.[75] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[74]</p><p>The Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[76] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula.[77]</p><p>In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[78] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[88][89][90]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mongols_suzdal.jpg/170px-Mongols_suzdal.jpg" width="170" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe.</p><p>In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[91] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[92] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[93][94] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[95] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.</p><p>The Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[96] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[97][98] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[99] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[100] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25&nbsp;million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[101]</p><p>The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, foreigners, beggars and lepers.[102] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[103] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[104]</p><p>Main article: Early modern period

The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.[105][106][107] The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church, and an emerging merchant class.[108][109][110] Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.[111][112]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism.

The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[114] This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[115] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[116]</p><p>The 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline.[117] Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[118] From the Union of Krewo (1385) central and eastern Europe was dominated by Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1648 and 1655 in the central and eastern Europe ended hegemony of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[119] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia). Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, laying siege to Vienna in 1529. In the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the Battle of Vienna permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe.</p><p>The Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development.[120] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Isaac Newton.[121] According to Peter Barrett, It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.[105]</p><p>In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Portugal and Spain, two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[122][123] Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia.[124] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>18th and 19th centuries</h3><p>Main article: Modern history

These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[135] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[136]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png/170px-The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png" width="170" height="203"><br><p>Ottoman Europe in 1856</p><p>In parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774).

The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912-1913.[137] Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg/220px-Marshall%27s_flax-mill%2C_Holbeck%2C_Leeds_-_interior_-_c.1800.jpg" width="220" height="168"><br><p>Marshall's Temple Works (1840), the Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain</p><p>The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe.

Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[159] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[160]</p><p>The social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany, and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy, and in Ataturk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet, and state secularism. Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[161][162]</p><p>In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic.

On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland.

After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an Iron Curtain.

The EU established a parliament, court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[178] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[179]</p><h2>Geography</h2><p>Main article: Geography of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Europe_topography_map_en.png/220px-Europe_topography_map_en.png" width="220" height="179"><br><p>Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions</p><p>Europe makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[20] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[180] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.[181] Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.</p><p>This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.</p><h3>Climate</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Climate of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Vegetation_Europe.png/220px-Vegetation_Europe.png" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.[182] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed Europe's central heating, because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;°C (61&nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&nbsp;°C (54&nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude.

Along with fellow cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, he is credited with drafting the first world map that named America as a land mass.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Biography[edit]</h2><p>Ringmann was born in Eichhoffen, Alsace in 1482. He became a schoolmaster and was often described as a poet.</p><p>Around 1503, Ringmann visited Italy. There, he learned about the newly discovered western lands and the explorations that took place within them. These lands were initially known as the New World, and were later named the Americas. He also came to believe that Amerigo Vespucci had discovered South America.</p><p>Upon his return, Ringmann moved to Saint-Dié-des-Vosges in Lorraine with his friend, Martin Waldseemüller, a cartographer with whom he was working on a new Latin edition of Ptolemy's treatise on geography. Waldseemüller drew the maps while Ringmann edited the translation and wrote the preface. Ringmann was probably also the author of the introduction to Waldseemüller's great map and globe of the world, yet many historians attribute the work to Waldseemüller himself. Some historians have judged that Walter Ludd, the head of the Gymnasium Vosagense, paid Ringmann and Waldseemüller to do this work for publication at the Gymnasium's printing press at St. Dié.</p><p>Ringmann also may have read the French edition of Vespucci's letters, (Quatre Navigations d' Americ Vespuce). Since Vespucci's written accounts were in Italian, the translation to French could have been the source of Ringmann's misunderstanding of the accepted discoverer of the New World, as he believed that Vespucci discovered the new world. He described this in his introduction:</p><p>There is a fourth quarter of the world which Amerigo Vespucci has discovered and which for this reason we can call 'America' or the land of Americus [the Latin version of the Italian name Amerigo]. […] We do not see why the name of the man of genius, Amerigo, who has discovered them, should not be given to these lands, as Europe and Asia have adopted the names of women.</p><p>When the book was published by the name Cosmographiae Introductio on April 25, 1507, it was the first time that the word 'Americas' appeared in print. Waldseemüller corrected the error in a later edition and named South America Terra Nova, but the name America had now already been established.</p><p>Ringmann corrected the texts of the Latin editions of Ptolemy's geography—which had been published previously at Rome and Ulm using a Greek manuscript borrowed from Italy (Codex Vaticanum Graecorum 191.) During this time, Waldseemüller edited the Ptolemaic maps and also added twenty new maps to the collection. This was what was known as the first modern atlas of the world.</p><p>In 1508, Ringmann made the first translation of Julius Caesar's Commentaries into German with supplemental pieces by Suetonius, Plutarch, and others. One year later, he published a card game, Grammatica Figurata, to make the grammatical rules of Donatus', Ars Minor, more appealing to children. He died in 1511 in Sélestat.</p><h2>Grammatica Figurata[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/GrammaticaFigurata2.gif/220px-GrammaticaFigurata2.gif" width="220" height="282"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Grammatica Figurata (1509)</p><p>The Grammatica Figurata was first published by Mathias Ringmann in 1509. This work was an attempt to enliven Donatus' Ars Minor by printing up illustrated card sets for each grammatical rule. Apparently the children would have a card set. The rules are not explained at length, but a few hints are scattered here and there in the work. The final section on Exclamations has a sentence on how to figure out which student has won. Each card represented a part of speech, a gender, a case, or a tense, etc. Depending upon the teacher's questions a student would play the appropriate card or cards. Long believed to be lost, one copy of Grammatica figurata was found and reprinted in 1905.[2] Of particular interest are Ringmann's digressions on assorted subjects, from the prevalence of gambling among the German priesthood to the reasons behind his refusal to illustrate full-frontal nudity.</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><li id="cite_note-3">^ Jennie, Cohen.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd (1846 – 7 October 1920) was a native of Clifton, Bristol, England. An accountant as a young man, his means were such that he was able to pursue his interests as a naturalist and antiquarian. He was a member of a number of societies, often assuming leadership positions. Hudd is perhaps best known for his roles as author of Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District, editor of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, supervisor of the excavations undertaken by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, and author of Richard Ameryk and the name America.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background[edit]</h2><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd, son of leather merchant Samuel Hudd and his wife Mary Ann, was born in the second quarter of 1846 in Clifton.[1][2] An accountant, he married Catharine Bowles Edmonds in the first quarter of 1872, their marriage recorded in the registration district of Faringdon, Berkshire.[3] In 1881, Alfred and his wife resided at Clinton House on Pembroke Road in Clifton.[4]</p><h2>Naturalist[edit]</h2><p>By 1870, Hudd was a member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, which had been founded in 1862.[5][6] He was first appointed to the Council of the society on 6 May 1875, and remained a member of the Council for years, until about 1892.[7][8][9] After a hiatus as a Council member for several years, Hudd was reappointed to the Council in 1899, where he remained until at least 1901.[10] He specialised in entomology. His Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District was published in six parts in the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society:</p><p>Hudd was also a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London, founded in 1833, and now known as the Royal Entomological Society of London.[17][18] In 1912, he presented his collection of 1300 coleoptera (beetle) specimens to the Bristol Museum and Library, now the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, to supplement the Stephen Barton (d. 1898) collection. His collection of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) specimens was added to the George C. Griffiths (1852–1924) collection at the Bristol Museum.[18] Hudd also contributed a short chapter on The Insects of the Bristol District to the Handbook to Bristol and the neighbourhood.[19]</p><h2>Antiquarian[edit]</h2><p>Hudd was elected secretary of the Clifton Antiquarian Club at its first meeting on 23 January 1884 at the Bristol Museum and Library.[20] He retained that position during all twenty-eight years of the original society. Not only a founding member of the club, Alfred Edmund Hudd had the distinction of being the only member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club to remain with the original organisation from its inception in 1884 to its end in 1912. He served as editor of the society's seven volumes of Proceedings,[21] also contributing 21 papers.[22] His service to the organisation was acknowledged on 5 January 1898 when the club presented him with a silver bowl and a set of four silver candlesticks.[23] In 1911, the membership of the club again paid tribute to his efforts, with an inscribed, inlaid grandfather clock.[21]</p><p>Alfred Hudd was a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and served on its Council.[24][25] On 9 August 1904, he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland at a meeting of that organisation held at Tuam, County Galway.[26] In addition, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27]</p><h2>Caerwent Exploration Fund[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg/160px-Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg" width="160" height="213"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Excavations at Caerwent in south Wales</p><p>Alfred Hudd was closely involved with the Caerwent Exploration Fund. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in February 1899, Alfred Trice Martin, also a founding member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, suggested that a systematic excavation of Caerwent, a Roman town in south Wales, be undertaken.[27] The Caerwent Exploration Fund was established by the Clifton Antiquarian Club soon thereafter. In September 1899, at Caerwent, Godfrey Morgan, Lord Tredegar, was elected President of the Caerwent Exploration Fund and Alfred Hudd was elected Treasurer.[27][28] Hudd and Thomas Ashby, Junior, both members of the Executive Committee of the Fund, supervised the excavations at Caerwent.[29] During the period between 1899 and 1913, two-thirds of the Roman town in south Wales was revealed. The archive of Caerwent, which was discovered during the excavations by the Fund, is in the archaeology collection of Newport Museum.[29] The reports on the excavations at Caerwent were published in Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27] Much of the success of the Caerwent Exploration Fund has been attributed to Alfred Hudd.[30]</p><h2>The naming of America[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Stradanus_America.jpg/220px-Stradanus_America.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>America by Johannes Stradanus
(1523–1605). "Americus rediscovers America. He called her but once and thenceforth she was always awake."[31]</p><p>The traditional theory of the naming of America is that it was named in honour of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator. At the turn of the sixteenth century, Vespucci undertook a series of voyages (the number of which remains unresolved) in search of a western passage to the Indies. After the voyage of 1501–1502, he proposed that the areas that he and, separately, Christopher Columbus had explored were not part of Asia, but rather a New World.[32][33] America first received its name in the Cosmographiae Introductio, published by cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in 1507. Vespucci's published letters (the authenticity of which is contested) were the inspiration for that work, which was authored by a group of scholars in Saint-Dié, Lorraine, France. They revised Ptolemy's Geography to include the New World and reasoned that, as the three previously known continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, had feminine names, so should the New World. Accordingly, the feminised version of the Latin form of the baptismal name of the discoverer of the New World, Vespucci, was utilised.[32][33] The appendix of the book included Waldseemüller's map of the world in which the New World was labelled America. The map, rediscovered in a German castle in 1901, was the first to use the name America and the first to depict a Western Hemisphere.[33][34] The Library of Congress purchased the 1507 Waldseemüller map in 2003. On 30 April 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel transferred the map, also known as America's birth certificate, to the people of the United States in a ceremony at the Library of Congress.[35]</p><p>There are several alternate theories of the naming of America.[33] Alfred Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings. In Richard Ameryk and the name America, Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498–1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from King Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for handing over the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503).[33][36] Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Further, Hudd quoted a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497.[33][36]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This year (1497), on St. John the Baptist's day (June 24th), the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristow, in a ship of Bristowe called the 'Mathew,' the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe the 2nd of May and came home again the 6th August following.[36]</p><p>Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 Cosmographiae Introductio, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci.[33][36] While Hudd's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, there is no hard proof to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk.[33][37][38]</p><h2>Later life[edit]</h2><p>Hudd's first wife Kate died on 4 April 1889 and was buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery in Naples, Italy.[39] Hudd married Adeline Sophia Tyzack in the fourth quarter of 1891 in the registration district of Kensington, London.[3] In 1901, he resided at 94 Pembroke Road in Clifton with his second wife Adeline and two daughters.[40] Alfred Edmund Hudd of 108 Pembroke Road in Clifton died on 7 October 1920, his death registered in Bristol in the fourth quarter of the year. His estate of almost £16,000 went to probate on 17 December 1920. His wife survived him.[41][42]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.[3][4] The father of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci had the name Amerigo Vespucci also. [5]</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence. While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by Lorenzo de' Medici. Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.[3] In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with Christopher Columbus and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies. Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.[3] After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.[3]</p><h2>Expeditions</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>At the invitation of king Manuel I of Portugal, Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502. On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.</p><p>The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus. In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset Christopher Columbus' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.[citation needed]</p><h2>Historical role</h2><p>In 1508, the position of chief of navigation of Spain (piloto mayor de Indias) was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg/200px-Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Vespucci's first encounter with Native Americans in Honduras, 1497 (De Bry's illustration, c.1592)</p><p>Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime.

Mundus Novus was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.[6] Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as Lettera al Soderini or just Lettera, was a letter in Italian addressed to Piero Soderini. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German Martin Waldseemüller in 1507 in Cosmographiae Introductio, a book on cosmography and geography, as Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).[6]</p><p>On March 22, 1508, King Ferdinand made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary[7] and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg/200px-Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg" width="200" height="133"><br><p>The first known depiction of cannibalism in the New World.

One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the four voyages. Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.[6]</p><p>Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in Lorraine. Vespucci used a Latinised form of his name, Americus Vespucius, in his Latin writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form America, according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women. It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him.[8]</p><p>The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.</p><p>Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.</p><h2>Voyages</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg/170px-Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg" width="170" height="297"><br><p>Portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child, part of the Madonna della Misericordia (c. 1472) by Domenico Ghirlandaio at the Ognissanti church in Florence</p><p>The first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabulous, but the second and third are certain.</p><h3>First voyage</h3><p>A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.[9] Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.[10] The names of Amerigo Vespucci's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Second voyage</h3><p>About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with Alonso de Ojeda (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.[11] After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of Hispaniola. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially [12] on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,[12] which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.</p><h3>Third voyage</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg/220px-Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg" width="220" height="299"><br><p>Portrait of Vespucci which titles him "discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land"</p><p>The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by Gonçalo Coelho in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal. Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of Pedro Álvares Cabral's ships returning from India. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.[11] On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif/lossless-page1-250px-%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif.png" width="250" height="183"><br><p>Vespucci awakens "America" in a Stradanus engraving (circa 1638)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula.[13] Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by Ptolemy or Marco Polo and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.[citation needed]</p><h3>Fourth voyage</h3><p>Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.[14] The only source of information for the last voyage is the Letter to Soderini,[15] but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip.[b] However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain Gonçalo Coelho, very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well.[16] However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.</p><p>The letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.[17]</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Vespucci was a cousin of the husband of Simonetta Vespucci. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.</p><h2>Final years</h2><p>Not long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by Ferdinand II of Aragon in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish House of Trade, based in Seville.</p><p>He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain.[18][19]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>a Europeans had long conceptualized the Afro-Eurasian landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: Europe, Asia, and Africa. Once cosmographers realized that the New World was not connected to the Old (but before its true geography was fully mapped), they considered the Americas to be a single, fourth continent.


b The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 Mundus Novus and the 1505 Letter of Soderini, the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924). He proposed the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the "Ridolfi fragment" (Formisiano, 1992: p.37–44) – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship. The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful. Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp. the first) differing from Arciniegas. Fernández-Armesto (2007: p.128) declares the authenticity question "inconclusive", hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2> </h2><h2>References</h2><h2> </h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Newfoundland (/nju?f?n'lænd/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen) new-f?n-LAND;[5] Spanish: Terranova, French: Terre-Neuve, Mi'kmaq: Taqamkuk, Irish: Talamh an Éisc, Inuttitut: Kallunasillik / Ikkarumikluak[6]) is a large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland, and the most populous part of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It has 29 percent of the province's land area. The island is separated from the Labrador Peninsula by the Strait of Belle Isle and from Cape Breton Island by the Cabot Strait. It blocks the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, creating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the world's largest estuary. Newfoundland's nearest neighbour is the French overseas community of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.</p><p>With an area of 108,860 square kilometres (42,031&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[7] Newfoundland is the world's 16th-largest island, Canada's fourth-largest island, and the largest Canadian island outside the North. The provincial capital, St. John's, is located on the southeastern coast of the island; Cape Spear, just south of the capital, is the easternmost point of North America, excluding Greenland. It is common to consider all directly neighbouring islands such as New World, Twillingate, Fogo and Bell Island to be 'part of Newfoundland' (as distinct from Labrador). By that classification, Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of 111,390 square kilometres (43,008&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).[8]</p><p>According to 2006 official Census Canada statistics, 57% of responding Newfoundland and Labradorians claim British or Irish ancestry, with 43.2% claiming at least one English parent, 21.5% at least one Irish parent, and 7% at least one parent of Scottish origin. Additionally 6.1% claimed at least one parent of French ancestry.[9] The island's total population as of the 2006 census was 479,105.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Long settled by indigenous peoples of the Dorset culture, the island was visited by the Icelandic Viking Leif Eriksson in the 11th century, who called the new land Vinland.[citation needed] The next European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. The island was visited by the Genoese navigator John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), working under contract to King Henry VII of England on his expedition from Bristol in 1497. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. (After European settlement, colonists first called the island Terra Nova, from New Land in Portuguese and Latin.)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Gilbert_plaque.jpg/150px-Gilbert_plaque.jpg" width="150" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Plaque commemorating Gilbert's founding of the British Empire</p><p>On August 5, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland as England's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I of England, thus officially establishing a fore-runner to the much later British Empire.[10] Newfoundland is considered Britain's oldest colony.[11] At the time of English settlement, the Beothuk inhabited the island.</p><p>While there is archaeological evidence of ancient indigenous peoples on the island, it was abandoned when the Norse arrived from Scandinavia.[citation needed] L'Anse aux Meadows was a Norse settlement near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland (Cape Norman), which has been dated to be approximately 1,000 years old. The site is considered the only undisputed evidence of Pre-Columbian contact between the Old and New Worlds, if the Norse-Inuit contact on Greenland is not counted. There is a second suspected Norse site in Point Rosee. The island is a likely location of Vinland, mentioned in the Viking Chronicles, although this has been disputed.</p><p>The indigenous people on the island at the time of European settlement were the Beothuk, who spoke an Amerindian language of the same name. Later immigrants developed a variety of dialects associated with settlement on the island: Newfoundland English, Newfoundland French.[citation needed] In the 19th century, it also had a dialect of Irish known as Newfoundland Irish.[citation needed] Scottish Gaelic was spoken on the island during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the Codroy Valley area, chiefly by settlers from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.[12] The Gaelic names reflected the association with fishing: in Scottish Gaelic, it was called Eilean a' Trosg, or literally, Island of the Cod.[13] Similarly, the Irish Gaelic name Talamh an Éisc means Land of the Fish.</p><h3>First inhabitants[edit]</h3><p>The first inhabitants of Newfoundland were the Paleo-Eskimo, who have no known link to other groups in Newfoundland history. Little is known about them beyond archeological evidence of early settlements. Evidence of successive cultures have been found. The Late Paleo-Eskimo, or Dorset culture, settled there about 4,000 years ago. They were descendants of migrations of ancient prehistoric peoples across the High Arctic thousands of years ago, after crossing from Siberia via the Bering land bridge. The Dorset died off or abandoned the island prior to the arrival of the Norse.[citation needed]</p><p>After this period, the Beothuk settled Newfoundland, migrating from Labrador on the mainland. There is no evidence that the Beothuk inhabited the island prior to Norse settlement. Scholars believe that the Beothuk are related closely to the Innu of Labrador.[citation needed] The tribe later became extinct although people of partial Beothuk descent have been documented[citation needed]. The name Beothuk means people in their own language which is a member of the Algonquian language family which itself is common to many Atlantic coastal tribes.</p><p>The tribe is now extinct but evidence of its culture is preserved in museum, historical and archaeological records. Shanawdithit, a woman who is often regarded as the last full-blood Beothuk, died in St. John's in 1829 of tuberculosis. However, Santu Toney, who was born around 1835 and died in 1910, was a woman of mixed Mi'kmaq and Beothuk descent which means that some Beothuk must have lived on beyond 1829. Her father was a Beothuk and mother a Mi'kmaq, both from Newfoundland. The Beothuk may have intermingled and assimilated with Innu in Labrador and Mi'kmaq in Newfoundland. Oral histories also suggest potential historical competition and hostility between the Beothuk and Mi'kmaq.[citation needed] The Mi'kmaq, Innu and Inuit all hunted and fished around Newfoundland before the arrival of Europeans but no evidence indicates that they lived on the island for long periods of time and would only travel to Newfoundland temporarily. Inuit have been documented on the Great Northern Peninsula as late as the 18th-Century. Newfoundland was historically the southernmost part of the Inuit's territorial range.</p><p>When Europeans arrived from 1497 and later, starting with John Cabot, they established contact with the Beothuk. Estimates of the number of Beothuk on the island at this time vary, ranging from 700 to 5,000.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Later both the English and French settled the island. They were followed by the Mi'kmaq, an Algonquian-speaking indigenous people from eastern Canada and present-day Nova Scotia. As European and Mi'kmaq settlement became year-round and expanded to new areas of the coast, the area available to the Beothuk to harvest the marine resources they relied upon was diminished. By the beginning of the 19th century, few Beothuk remained. Most died due to infectious diseases carried by Europeans, to which they had no immunity, and starvation. Government attempts to engage with the Beothuk and aid them came too late. The Beothuk were exceptionally hostile to foreigners, unlike the Mi'kmaq. The latter readily traded with Europeans and became established in settlements in Newfoundland.</p><h3>European contact, colonisation and settlement[edit]</h3><p>Main article: History of Newfoundland and Labrador</p><p>Newfoundland is the site of the only authenticated Norse (mostly Greenlandic Icelanders) settlement in North America. This archeological site was discovered by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, at L'Anse aux Meadows in 1960. The site has been the subject of multi-year archaeological digs in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>These have revealed that the settlement dated to more than 500 years before John Cabot; it contains the earliest-known European structures in North America. Designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO, it is believed to be the Vinland settlement of explorer Leif Eiriksson. (The Icelandic Skálholt Vinland Map of 1570 refers to the area as Promontorium Winlandiæ and correctly shows it on a 51°N parallel with Bristol, England). The Norse stayed for a relatively short period of time, believed to be between 999 and 1001 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Cabot_tower.jpg/250px-Cabot_tower.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>Cabot Tower located in St John's</p><p>After the departure of the Norse, the island was inhabited by aboriginal populations for nearly 500 years. In 1497, the Italian navigator John Cabot (Zuan/Giovanni Cabotto) became the first European since the Norse settlers to set foot on Newfoundland, working under commission of King Henry VII of England. His landing site is unknown but popularly believed to be Cape Bonavista, along the island's East coast.,[14] Another site claimed is Cape Bauld, at the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula. A document found in the Spanish National Archives, written by a Bristol merchant, reports that Cabot's crew landed 1,800 miles (2,900&nbsp;km) west of Dursey Head, Ireland (latitude 51° 35'N), which would put Cabot within sight of Cape Bauld. This document mentions an island that Cabot sailed past to go ashore on the mainland. This description fits with the Cape Bauld theory, as Belle Isle is not far offshore.[14]</p><p>After Cabot, the first European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Late in the 17th century came Irish fishermen, who named the island Talamh an Éisc, meaning land of the fish, or the fishing grounds in Irish Gaelic. This reflected the abundance of fisheries.</p><p>In 1583, when Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally claimed Newfoundland as a colony of England, he found numerous English, French and Portuguese vessels at St. John's. There was no permanent population. Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, and plans of settlement were postponed.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>On July 5, 1610, John Guy set sail from Bristol, England with 39 other colonists for Cuper's Cove. This, and other early attempts at permanent settlement failed to make a profit for the English investors, but some settlers remained, forming the very earliest modern European population on the island. By 1620, the fishermen of England's West Country dominated the east coast of Newfoundland. French fishermen dominated the island's south coast and Northern Peninsula.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg/250px-Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg" width="250" height="244"><br><p>James Cook's 1775 Chart of Newfoundland</p><p>After 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, the French ceded control of south and north shores of the island to the British. They kept only the nearby islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, located in the fish-rich Grand Banks off the south coast. Despite some early settlements by the English, the Crown discouraged permanent, year-round settlement of Newfoundland by migratory fishery workers. Thomas Nash was an Irish Catholic fisherman who permanently settled in Newfoundland despite English rule. He established the fishing town of Branch.[15] He and his cousin Father Patrick Power of Callan, County Kilkenny, spread Catholicism in Newfoundland. This settlement attracted a major migration of Irish Catholic immigrants to Newfoundland in the early eighteenth century.[16]</p><p>By the late 18th century, permanent settlement increased, peaking in the early years of the 19th century.[17]</p><p>The French name for the island is Terre Neuve. The name Newfoundland' is one of the oldest European place names in Canada in continuous geographical and cartographical use, dating from a 1502 letter. It was stated in the following 1628 poem:</p><p>A Skeltonicall continued ryme, in praise of my New-found-Land</p><p>Although in cloaths, company, buildings faire
With England, New-found-land cannot compare:
Did some know what contentment I found there,
Alwayes enough, most times somewhat to spare,
With little paines, lesse toyle, and lesser care,
Exempt from taxings, ill newes, Lawing, feare,
If cleane, and warme, no matter what you weare,
Healthy, and wealthy, if men careful are,
With much-much more, then I will now declare,
(I say) if some wise men knew what this were
(I doe beleeue) they'd live no other where.

It was also different from those other immigrants would build on the North American mainland. As a fish-exporting society, Newfoundland was in contact with many ports and societies around the Atlantic rim. But its geographic location and political distinctiveness isolated it from its closest neighbours, Canada and the United States. Internally, most of its population was spread widely around a rugged coastline in small outport settlements. Many were distant from larger centres of population and isolated for long periods by winter ice or bad weather. These conditions had an effect on the cultures of the immigrants. They generated new ways of thinking and acting. Newfoundland and Labrador developed a wide variety of distinctive customs, beliefs, stories, songs and dialects.</p><p>The First World War had a powerful and lasting effect on the society. From a population of about a quarter of a million, 5,482 men went overseas. Nearly 1,500 were killed and 2,300 wounded. On July 1, 1916, at Beaumont-Hamel, France, 753 men of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment went over the top of a trench. The next morning, only 68 men answered the roll-call. Even now, when the rest of Canada celebrates the founding of the country on July 1, many Newfoundlanders take part in solemn ceremonies of remembrance.</p><p>The Second World War also had a lasting effect on Newfoundland. In particular, the United States assigned forces to the military bases at Argentia, Gander, Stephenville, Goose Bay and St. John's.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg/250px-Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg" width="250" height="192"><br><p>Joseph Smallwood signing the document bringing Newfoundland into Confederation.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador is the youngest province in Canada. Newfoundland was organised as a colony in 1825, was self-governing from 1855–1934, and held dominion status from 1907–1949 (see Dominion of Newfoundland). In late 1948, the population of the colony voted 52.3% to 47.7%[18] in favour of joining Canada as a province. Opposition was concentrated among residents of the capital St. John's, and on the Avalon Peninsula.</p><p>Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949. Union with Canada has done little to reduce Newfoundlanders' self-image as a unique group. In 2003, 72% of residents responding identified first as Newfoundlanders, secondarily as Canadians.[19] Separatist sentiment is low, though, less than 12% in the same 2003 study.</p><p>The referendum campaign of 1948 was bitterly fought, and interests in both Canada and Britain favoured and supported confederation with Canada. Jack Pickersgill, a western Canadian native and politician, worked with the confederation camp during the campaign. The Catholic Church, whose members were a minority on the island, lobbied for continued independence. Canada offered financial incentives, including a baby bonus for each child in a family. The Confederates were led by the charismatic Joseph Smallwood, a former radio broadcaster, who had developed socialist political inclinations while working for a socialist newspaper in New York City.

In 1904, the crown of the Blue Ensign was replaced with the Great Seal of Newfoundland (having been given royal approval in 1827) and the British Parliament designated Newfoundland Red and Blue ensigns as official flags specifically for Newfoundland. The Red and Blue ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were used officially from 1904 until 1965, with the Red Ensign being flown as civil ensign by merchant shipping, and the Blue being flown by governmental ships (after the British tradition of having different flags for merchant/naval and government vessel identification).</p><p>On September 26, 1907, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom declared the Colony of Newfoundland, as an independent Dominion within the British Empire,[21] and from that point until 1965, the Newfoundland Red Ensign was used as the civil ensign of the Dominion of Newfoundland with the Blue Ensign, again, reserved for government shipping identification. In 1931 the Newfoundland National Assembly adopted the Union Jack as the official national flag, with the Red and Blue Ensigns retained as ensigns for shipping identification.[22]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/175px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Union Flag, official flag of both the Dominion and province of Newfoundland from 1931 to 1980</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Flag_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg/175px-Flag_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador, legislated as the provincial flag on May 28, 1980</p><p>On March 31, 1949, Newfoundland became a province of Canada but retained the Union Jack in legislature, still designating it as the national flag.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Central America (Spanish: América Central or Centroamérica) is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)[2] and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America—except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama—was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, though, people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state (e.g. it is still common to write C.A. after the country names, in formal and informal contexts).</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Different definitions[edit]</h2><p>Central America may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Central America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg/220px-1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg" width="220" height="300"><br><p>Central America, 1798</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG/220px-Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG" width="220" height="293"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Tikal, Guatemala.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Tazumal_10.jpg/220px-Tazumal_10.jpg" width="220" height="149"><br><p>Tazumal, El Salvador.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg/220px-CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg" width="220" height="155"><br><p>Copan, Honduras.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg/220px-Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>Altun Ha, Belize.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg/220px-Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Stone spheres of Costa Rica.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg/220px-HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg" width="220" height="157"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Ancient footprints of Acahualinca, Nicaragua.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some[11] culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.</p><p>Following Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.[citation needed]</p><p>In 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.</p><p>The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.</p><p>From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.[citation needed]</p><p>The Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.[citation needed]</p><p>The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506–1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.[citation needed]</p><p>Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation.

The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America,[7] while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Isthmus of Panama, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.</p><p>Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At 4,220 meters (13,850&nbsp;ft), Volcán Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:</p><p>High points in Central America</p><p>Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.[14]</p><p>Trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.[15]</p><h2>Biodiversity[edit]</h2><p>See also: Central America bioregion</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg/220px-El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg" width="220" height="296"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>El Chorreron in El Salvador</p><p>Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.[16] The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropic ecozones. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.[16] The table below shows recent statistics:</p><p>Biodiversity in Central America (number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants)</p><p>Over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.[24]</p><p>Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.[25] A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species. So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.[26]</p><h3>Flora[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg/220px-Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>One of the hanging bridges of the skywalk at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Monteverde, Costa Rica disappearing into the clouds</p><p>From 2001 to 2010, 5,376 square kilometers (2,076&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers (4,711&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers (1,830&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers (793&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers (3,310&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers (1,180&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.[27]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers (43,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[28] extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between 600–1,800 metres (2,000–5,900&nbsp;ft) elevation,[28] and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above 1,800 metres (5,900&nbsp;ft) are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.</p><p>Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1,000 meters (3,300&nbsp;ft) above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia.[29] The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.</p><p>The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund.[30] These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800–4,000 metres (5,900–13,100&nbsp;ft), on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers (5,100&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.[30]</p><h3>Fauna[edit]</h3><p>See also: List of Central American mammals and List of Central American monkey species</p><p>Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised.

Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.</p><p>Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some 60–160 kilometers (37–99&nbsp;mi) off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.[31] For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.</p><p>The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.</p><p>Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly 80 kilometers (50&nbsp;mi) to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.[32]</p><p>Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.</p><p>Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>See also: Ethnic groups in Central America and Latin Americans</p><p>The population of Central America is estimated at 42,688,190 as of 2012.[3] With an area of 523,780 square kilometers (202,230&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[2] it has a population density of 81 per square kilometer (210/sq&nbsp;mi).</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png/220px-Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png" width="220" height="146"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Linguistic variations of classic Central American Spanish.

				This article is about the British city. For other uses, see Bristol (disambiguation).</p><p>Bristol (/'br?st?l/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) is a city and county[4] in South West England with a population of 454,200[5] in 2017. The district has the 10th largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.</p><p>Iron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English the place at the bridge). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham in the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the U.K.- the Bristol pound, which is pegged to the Pound sterling. The city has two universities, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England, and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the Royal West of England Academy, the Arnolfini, Spike Island, Ashton Gate and the Memorial Stadium. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road, rail, sea and air by the M5 and M4 (which connect to the city centre by the Portway and M32), Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway mainline rail stations, and Bristol Airport.</p><p>One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness series of travel guides. The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the EU's European Green Capital Award in 2015.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>The most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge.[6] It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer.[7] Alternative etymologies are supported with the numerous orthographic variations in Medieval documents with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.[8]</p><p>The Old English form Brycgstow is commonly used to derive the meaning place at the bridge.[9] Utilizing another form, Brastuile, Rev. Dr. Shaw derived the name from the Celtic words bras (quick, rapid), or braos (a gap, chasm,) and tuile (a stream). The poet Thomas Chatterton popularised a derivation from Brictricstow linking the town to Brictric, the last king of Wessex. It appears that the form Bricstow prevailed until 1204,[10] and the Bristolian 'L' (the tendency for the local accent to add a letter L to the end of some words) is what eventually changed the name to Bristol.[11]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: History of Bristol and Timeline of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Fifteenth-century pictorial map of Bristol, radiating from the town centre" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png/220px-Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png" width="220" height="345"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Robert Ricart's map of Bristol, drawn when he became common clerk of the town in 1478.

Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.[16]</p><h3>Middle Ages[edit]</h3><p>Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name.[17] By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons.[17] Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England.[18] Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.[19]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg/220px-Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Black and white etching showing the towers of St Stephen's Church, St Augustine the Less Church and Bristol Cathedral, published c.1850</p><p>The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls.[20] By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s.[21] The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373,[22] the first town in England to be given this status.[23][24][25] During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre.[26] By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London.[27] One-third to one-half the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49,[28] which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.[29]</p><h3>15th and 16th centuries[edit]</h3><p>During the 15th century Bristol was the second most important port in the country, trading with Ireland,[30] Iceland[31] and Gascony.[26] It was the starting point for many voyages, including Robert Sturmy's (1457–58) unsuccessful attempt to break the Italian monopoly of Eastern Mediterranean trade.[32] New exploration voyages were launched by Venetian John Cabot, who in 1497 made landfall in North America.[33] A 1499 voyage, led by merchant William Weston of Bristol, was the first expedition commanded by an Englishman to North America.[34] During the first decade of the 16th century Bristol's merchants undertook a series of exploration voyages to North America and even founded a commercial organisation, 'The Company Adventurers to the New Found Land', to assist their endeavours.[35] However, they seem to have lost interest in North America after 1509, having incurred great expenses and made little profit.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>During the 16th century, Bristol merchants concentrated on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies.[36] This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, such as food and guns, to Iberia[37] during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604).[38] Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.[39]</p><br><img alt="A stone built Victorian Gothic building with two square towers and a central arched entrance underneath a circular ornate window.

Bristol also gained city status that year.[42] During the English Civil War in the 1640s the city was occupied by Royalists, who built the Royal Fort House on the site of an earlier Parliamentarian stronghold.[43]</p><h3>17th and 18th centuries[edit]</h3><p>Growth of the city and trade came with the rise of England's American colonies in the 17th century. Bristol's location on the west side of Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made the most of it. The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery to the Americas. Bristol and Liverpool became centres of the Triangular Trade. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the Middle Passage under brutal conditions.[44] In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic.[44] Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The Somersett Case of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England.[45] At the height of the Bristol slave trade from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas.[46] The Seven Stars public house,[47] where abolitionist Thomas Clarkson collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.[48]</p><br><img alt=" An engraving showing at the top a sailing ship and paddle steamer in a harbour, with sheds and a church spire.

Because of Bristol's nautical environment, maritime safety was an important issue in the city. During the 19th century, Samuel Plimsoll, known as the sailor's friend, campaigned to make the seas safer; shocked by overloaded vessels, he successfully fought for a compulsory load line on ships.[50]</p><p>In 1739 John Wesley founded the first Methodist chapel, the New Room, in Bristol.[51] Wesley, along with his brother Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, preached to large congregations in Bristol and the neighbouring village of Kingswood, often in the open air.[52][53]</p><h3>19th century[edit]</h3><p>The city was associated with Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway between Bristol and London Paddington, two pioneering Bristol-built oceangoing steamships (SS&nbsp;Great Britain and SS&nbsp;Great Western), and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The new railway replaced the Kennet and Avon Canal, which had fully opened in 1810 as the main route for the transport of goods between Bristol and London.[54] Competition from Liverpool (beginning around 1760), disruptions of maritime commerce due to war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to Bristol's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of Northern England and the West Midlands. The tidal Avon Gorge, which had secured the port during the Middle Ages, had become a liability. An 1804–09 plan to improve the city's port with a floating harbour designed by William Jessop was a costly error, requiring high harbour fees.[55]</p><p>By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over 300 feet (90&nbsp;m) from reaching the harbour, resulting in falling trade.[56] The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.[57] Some of the traditional industries including copper and brass manufacture went into decline,[58] but the import and processing of tobacco flourished with the expansion of the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills business.[59]</p><p>Supported by new industry and growing commerce, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801), quintupled during the 19th century,[60] resulting in the creation of new suburbs such as Clifton and Cotham. These provide architectural examples from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and at right angles to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic medieval gothic style appeared, partially as a reaction against the symmetry of Palladianism, and can be seen in buildings such as the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery,[61] the Royal West of England Academy,[62] and The Victoria Rooms.[63] Riots broke out in 1793[64] and 1831; the first over the renewal of tolls on Bristol Bridge, and the second against the rejection of the second Reform Bill by the House of Lords.[65] The Diocese of Bristol had undergone several boundary changes by 1897 when it was reconstituted into the configuration which has lasted into the 21st century.[66]</p><br><img alt="An old ordnance survey map of Bristol, showing roads, railways, rivers and contours." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Bristol_map_1946.jpg/220px-Bristol_map_1946.jpg" width="220" height="204"><br><p>A 1946 map of Bristol</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>20th century[edit]</h3><p>From a population of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971.[67] Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock.[68] Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s.[69] As air travel grew in the first half of the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories.[70]</p><p>Bristol was heavily damaged by Luftwaffe raids during World War II; about 1,300 people living or working in the city were killed and nearly 100,000 buildings were damaged, at least 3,000 beyond repair.[71][72] The original central market area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed churches and fragments of the castle. A third bomb-damaged church nearby, St Nicholas, has been restored and is a museum housing a 1756 William Hogarth triptych painted for the high altar of St Mary Redcliffe. The museum also has statues of King Edward I (moved from Arno's Court Triumphal Arch) and King Edward III (taken from Lawfords' Gate in the city walls when they were demolished about 1760), and 13th-century statues of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (builder of Bristol Castle)[73] and Geoffrey de Montbray (who built the city's walls) from Bristol's Newgate.[74]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg/220px-Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Ambrose Road, in the Cliftonwood neighbourhood</p><p>The rebuilding of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead shopping area regenerated, and one of the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished.[75] Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).[76]</p><p>The 20th century relocation of the docks to Avonmouth Docks and Royal Portbury Dock, 7 miles (11&nbsp;km) downstream from the city centre, has allowed the redevelopment of the old dock area (the Floating Harbour).[77] Although the docks' existence was once in jeopardy (since the area was seen as a derelict industrial site), the inaugural 1996 International Festival of the Sea held in and around the docks affirmed the area as a leisure asset of the city.[78]</p><h2>Government[edit]</h2><br><img alt="A large brick building, built in a shallow curve, with a central porch.

Main article: Politics of Bristol</p><p>Bristol City council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards,[79] with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held in three years out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election.[80] Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong in the city and (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.[81]</p><p>In February 2009, the Labour group resigned and the Liberal Democrats took office with a minority administration.[82] In the 4 June 2009 council elections the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council.[83] In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6.[84] In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which a third of the city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7&nbsp;seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2&nbsp;to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.[85]</p><p>These trends were continued into the next election in May 2014, in which Labour gained three seats to take their total to 31, the Green Party won two more seats, the Conservative party gained one seat, and UKIP won their first-ever seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats lost a further seven seats.[86]</p><p>On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a referendum on the question of a directly elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a directly elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012, and Independent candidate George Ferguson became Mayor of Bristol.[87]</p><p>The Lord Mayor of Bristol, not to be confused with the Mayor of Bristol, is a figurehead elected each May by the city council. Councillor Faruk Choudhury was selected by his fellow councillors for the position in 2013. At 38, he was the youngest person to serve as Lord Mayor of Bristol and the first Muslim elected to the office.[88]</p><p>Bristol constituencies in the House of Commons also included parts of other local authority areas until the 2010 general election, when their boundaries were aligned with the county boundary. The city is divided into Bristol West, East, South and North West.[89] Since the 2015 election, the city has had three Labour members of parliament (MPs) and one Conservative.[90]</p><p>The city has a tradition of political activism. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that he was a member of parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second.[91][92] Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol,[93] and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83.[94] In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act.[95] The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the social and economic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of fair trade was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.[96]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol is both a city and a county, since Edward III granted it a county charter in 1373.[22] The county was expanded in 1835 to include suburbs such as Clifton, and it was named a county borough in 1889 when that designation was introduced.[24] On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon.[97] The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.[98]</p><h2>Geography and environment[edit]</h2><h3>Boundaries[edit]</h3><p>See also: Subdivisions of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Suspension bridge between two brick built towers, over a wooded gorge, showing mud and water at the bottom.

The narrowest definition of the city is the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.[99]</p><p>A slightly broader definition used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol but outside the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary.[100] The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano.[101] The North Fringe of Bristol, a developed area in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named as part of a 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.[102]</p><h3>Greater Bristol[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Greater Bristol</p><p>The term Greater Bristol, used by the Government Office of the South West (now abolished), the Office for National Statistics and others,[103] refers to the city and portions of the three neighbouring local authorities?—?Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire?—?an area sometimes called the former Avon area or the West of England Partnership (WEP) area. Greater Bristol does not include Bath or Weston-super-Mare, which are included in the WEP area.[104] The Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways (FOSBR) conflates the terms Greater Bristol and Suburban Bristol.[105]</p><br><img alt="Rocky side to a gorge with a platform in front of a cave halfway up.

The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.[107]</p><p>The gorge, which helped protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone to build the city, and its surrounding land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.[107]</p><h3>Climate[edit]</h3><p>Located in southern England, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK with a mean annual temperature of approximately 10.5&nbsp;°C (50.9&nbsp;°F).[108][109] It is among the sunniest, with 1,541–1,885&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.[110] Although the city is partially sheltered by the Mendip Hills, it is exposed to the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel. Annual rainfall increases from north to south, with totals north of the Avon in the 600–900&nbsp;mm (24–35&nbsp;in) range and 900–1,200&nbsp;mm (35–47&nbsp;in) south of the river.[111] Rain is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with autumn and winter the wetter seasons. The Atlantic Ocean influences Bristol's weather, keeping its average temperature above freezing throughout the year, but winter frosts are frequent and snow occasionally falls from early November to late April. Summers are warm and drier, with variable sunshine, rain and clouds, and spring weather is unsettled.[112]</p><p>The weather stations nearest Bristol for which long-term climate data are available are Long Ashton (about 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) south west of the city centre) and Bristol Weather Station, in the city centre. Data collection at these locations ended in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and Filton Airfield is currently the nearest weather station to the city.[113] Temperatures at Long Ashton from 1959 to 2002 ranged from 33.5&nbsp;°C (92.3&nbsp;°F) in July 1976[114] to -14.4&nbsp;°C (6.1&nbsp;°F) in January 1982.[115] Monthly high temperatures since 2002 at Filton exceeding those recorded at Long Ashton include 25.7&nbsp;°C (78.3&nbsp;°F) in April 2003,[116] 34.5&nbsp;°C (94.1&nbsp;°F) in July 2006[117] and 26.8&nbsp;°C (80.2&nbsp;°F) in October 2011.[118] The lowest recent temperature at Filton was -10.1&nbsp;°C (13.8&nbsp;°F) in December 2010.[119] Although large cities in general experience an urban heat island effect, with warmer temperatures than their surrounding rural areas, this phenomenon is minimal in Bristol.[120]</p><h3>Environment[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Environment in Bristol</p><p>Bristol was ranked as Britain's most-sustainable city (based on its environmental performance, quality of life, future-proofing and approaches to climate change, recycling and biodiversity), topping environmental charity Forum for the Future's 2008 Sustainable Cities Index.[123][124] Local initiatives include Sustrans (creators of the National Cycle Network, founded as Cyclebag in 1977)[125] and Resourcesaver, a non-profit business established in 1988 by Avon Friends of the Earth.[126] In 2014 The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live.[127] The city received the 2015 European Green Capital Award, becoming the first UK city to receive this award.[128]</p><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Demography of Bristol</p><p>In 2014, the Office for National Statistics estimated the Bristol unitary authority's population at 442,474,[133][134] making it the 43rd-largest ceremonial county in England.[134] The ONS, using Census 2001 data, estimated the city's population at 441,556[135] and that of the contiguous urban area at 551,066.[136] In 2006 the ONS estimated Bristol's urban-area population at 587,400,[137] making it England's sixth-most-populous city and ninth-most-populous urban area.[136] At 3,599 inhabitants per square kilometre (9,321/sq&nbsp;mi) it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district.[138]</p><p>According to the 2011 census, 84% of the population was White (77.9% White British, 0.9% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Travellers and 5.1% Other White); 3.6% mixed-race (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% Asian (1.5% Indian, 1.6% Pakistani, 0.5% Bangladeshi, 0.9% Chinese and one percent other Asian); 6% Black (2.8% African, 1.6% Caribbean, 1.6% Other Black), 0.3% Arab and 0.6% with other heritage. Bristol is unusual among major British towns and cities in its larger black than Asian population.[139] These statistics apply to the Bristol Unitary Authority area, excluding areas of the urban area (2006 estimated population 587,400) in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) and North Somerset—such as Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Filton and Warmley.[67] 56.2% of the 209,995 Bristol Residents who are employed commute to work using either a car, van, motorbike or Taxi. While 2.2% commute by rail and 9.8% by bus, 19.6% walk.[140]</p><h2>Economy and industry[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Economy of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Two ornate metal pillars with large dishes on top in a paved street, with an eighteenth-century stone building behind, upon which can be seen the words &quot;Tea Blenders Estabklishec 177-&quot;.

Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products.[142] Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.[143][144]</p><p>Ships occasionally departed Bristol for Iceland as early as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot.[20] Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities.[20] In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.[145]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>By 1670 the city had 6,000&nbsp;tons of shipping (of which half was imported tobacco), and by the late 17th and early 18th centuries shipping played a significant role in the slave trade.[20] During the 18th century, Bristol was Britain's second-busiest port;[146] business was conducted in the trading area around The Exchange in Corn Street over bronze tables known as Nails. Although the Nails are cited as originating the phrase cash on the nail (immediate payment), the phrase was probably in use before their installation.[147]</p><p>The city's economy also relies on the aerospace, defence, media, information technology, financial services and tourism industries.[148][149] The Ministry of Defence (MoD)'s Procurement Executive, later known as the Defence Procurement Agency and Defence Equipment and Support, moved to its headquarters to Abbey Wood, Filton, in 1995. This organisation, with a staff of 7,000 to 8,000, procures and supports MoD equipment.[150] One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top-ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness guides for young adults.[151]</p><p>Bristol is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group, and is ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, the fourth highest ranked English city.[152] In 2014 Bristol's gross domestic product was £30.502&nbsp;billion.[153][154] Its per capita GDP was £46,000 ($65,106, €57,794), which was some 65% above the national average, the third highest of any English city (after London and Nottingham) and the sixth highest of any city in the United Kingdom (behind London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Nottingham).[153] Bristol's March 2007 unemployment rate was 4.8%, compared with four percent for South West England and the national average of 5.5%.[155]</p><p>Although Bristol's economy no longer relies upon its port, which was moved to docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s[156] and to the Royal Portbury Dock in 1977 as ship size increased, it is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330&nbsp;million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9&nbsp;million long tons (4&nbsp;million tonnes) to 11.8&nbsp;million (12&nbsp;million).[157] Tobacco importing and cigarette manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.[158]</p><p>The financial services sector employs 59,000 in the city,[159] and 50 micro-electronics and silicon design companies employ about 5,000. In 1983 Hewlett-Packard opened its national research laboratory in Bristol.[160][161] In 2014 the city was ranked seventh in the top 10 UK destinations by TripAdvisor.[162]</p><p>During the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at Filton by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later Rolls-Royce) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I Bristol Fighter[163] and World War II Blenheim and Beaufighter planes.[163] During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the Freighter, Britannia and Brabazon. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, luxury Bristol Cars at their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960.[164] The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.[165]</p><br><img alt="A view from below of an aeroplane in flight, with a slender fuselage and swept back wings." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg/220px-Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="157"><br><p>Final Concorde flight on 26 November 2003, shortly before landing on the Filton runway.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

The region also contains about 8% (by surface area) of the world's coral reefs[25] along with extensive seagrass meadows,[26] both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering the island and continental coasts of the region.</p><p>For the fungi, there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90,000 records derived from specimens in reference collections, published accounts and field observations.[27] That checklist includes more than 11250 species of fungi recorded from the region. As its authors note, the work is far from exhaustive, and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the Caribbean is higher. The true total number of fungal species occurring in the Caribbean, including species not yet recorded, is likely far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have been discovered.[28] Though the amount of available information is still small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to some Caribbean islands. For Cuba, 2200 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the island;[29] for Puerto Rico, the number is 789 species;[30] for the Dominican Republic, the number is 699 species;[31] for Trinidad and Tobago, the number is 407 species.[32]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Many of the ecosystems of the Caribbean islands have been devastated by deforestation, pollution, and human encroachment. The arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of giant owls and dwarf ground sloths.[33] The hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals (ranging from birds, to mammals and reptiles), fungi and plants. Examples of threatened animals include the Puerto Rican amazon, two species of solenodon (giant shrews) in Cuba and the Hispaniola island, and the Cuban crocodile.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Isla_Saona.jpg/750px-Isla_Saona.jpg" width="750" height="159"><p>Saona Island, Dominican Republic</p><p>The region's coral reefs, which contain about 70 species of hard corals and between 500–700 species of reef-associated fishes[34] have undergone rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in recent years, and are considered particularly vulnerable to global warming and ocean acidification.[35] According to a UNEP report, the Caribbean coral reefs might get extinct in next 20 years due to population explosion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas and global warming.[36]</p><p>Some Caribbean islands have terrain that Europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture. Tobacco was an important early crop during the colonial era, but was eventually overtaken by sugarcane production as the region's staple crop. Sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to Europe. Cuba and Barbados were historically the largest producers of sugar. The tropical plantation system thus came to dominate Caribbean settlement. Other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for agriculture, for example Dominica, which remains heavily forested. The islands in the southern Lesser Antilles, Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, are extremely arid, making them unsuitable for agriculture. However, they have salt pans that were exploited by the Dutch. Sea water was pumped into shallow ponds, producing coarse salt when the water evaporated.[37]</p><p>The natural environmental diversity of the Caribbean islands has led to recent growth in eco-tourism. This type of tourism is growing on islands lacking sandy beaches and dense human populations.[38]</p><h3>Plants and animals[edit]</h3><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Agostino_Brunias_-_Linen_Market%2C_Dominica_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Agostino_Brunias_-_Linen_Market%2C_Dominica_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="159"><br><p>A linen market in Dominica in the 1770s</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Agostino_Brunias._Free_Women_of_Color_with_Their_Children_and_Servants_in_a_Landscape%2C_ca._1770-1796.jpg/220px-Agostino_Brunias._Free_Women_of_Color_with_Their_Children_and_Servants_in_a_Landscape%2C_ca._1770-1796.jpg" width="220" height="173"><br><p>Agostino Brunias.

The population of the Caribbean is estimated to have been around 750,000 immediately before European contact, although lower and higher figures are given. After contact, social disruption and epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles (to which they had no natural immunity)[39] led to a decline in the Amerindian population.[40] From 1500 to 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from West Africa[41] such as the Kongo, Igbo, Akan, Fon and Yoruba as well as military prisoners from Ireland, who were deported during the Cromwellian reign in England.[citation needed] Immigrants from Britain, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark also arrived, although the mortality rate was high for both groups.[42]</p><p>The population is estimated to have reached 2.2 million by 1800.[43] Immigrants from India, China, Indonesia, and other countries arrived in the mid-19th century as indentured servants.[44] After the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, the population increased naturally.[45] The total regional population was estimated at 37.5 million by 2000.[46]</p><p>The majority of the Caribbean has populations of mainly Africans in the French Caribbean, Anglophone Caribbean and Dutch Caribbean, there are minorities of mixed-race (including Mulatto-Creole, Dougla, Mestizo, Quadroon, Cholo, Castizo, Criollo, Zambo, Pardo, Asian Latin Americans, Chindian, Cocoa panyols, and Eurasian); and European people of Spanish, Dutch, English, French, Italian, and Portuguese ancestry. Asians, especially those of Chinese, Indian descent, and Javenese Indonesians, form a significant minority in the region and also contribute to multiracial communities. Indians form a majority of the population in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Most of their ancestors arrived in the 19th century as indentured laborers.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Spanish-speaking Caribbean have primarily mixed race, African, or European majorities. Puerto Rico has a European majority with a mixture of European-African-Native American (tri-racial), and a large Mulatto (European-West African) and West African minority. One third of Cuba's (largest Caribbean island) population is of African descent, with a sizable Mulatto (mixed African–European) population, and European majority. The Dominican Republic has the largest mixed race population, primarily descended from Europeans, West Africans, and Amerindians.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Revellers_Wine_at_Trinidad_Carnival.jpg/220px-Revellers_Wine_at_Trinidad_Carnival.jpg" width="220" height="293"><br><p>Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago</p><p>Larger islands such as Jamaica, have a very large African majority, in addition to a significant mixed race, and has Chinese, Europeans, Indians, Latinos, Jews, and Arabs populations. This is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured laborers, and migration. Most multi-racial Jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or brown. Similar populations can be found in the Caricom states of Belize, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago has a multi-racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrivals of Africans, Indians, Chinese, Arabs, Jews, Spanish, Portuguese, and Europeans along with the Native Amerindians population. This multi-racial mix has created sub-ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include Dougla, Chindian, Mulatto-Creole, Afro-Asians, Eurasian, Cocoa panyols, and Asian Latin Americans</p><h3>Indigenous groups[edit]</h3><h3>Language[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Languages of the Caribbean</p><p>Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Haitian Creole, Antillean Creole French, and Papiamento are the predominant official languages of various countries in the region, though a handful of unique creole languages or dialects can also be found from one country to another.

Regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems. From a political and economic perspective, regionalism serves to make Caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions. In 1973, the first political regionalism in the Caribbean Basin was created by advances of the English-speaking Caribbean nations through the institution known as the Caribbean Common Market and Community (CARICOM)[49] which is located in Guyana.</p><p>Certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the Caribbean. On the one hand the Caribbean states are politically diverse, ranging from communist systems such as Cuba toward more capitalist Westminster-style parliamentary systems as in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other scholars argue that these differences are superficial, and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various Caribbean states. Contemporary Caribbean systems seem to reflect a blending of traditional and modern patterns, yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways.[50] The political systems of the Caribbean states share similar practices.</p><p>The influence of regionalism in the Caribbean is often marginalized. Some scholars believe that regionalism cannot exist in the Caribbean because each small state is unique. On the other hand, scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the Caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists. Proximity as well as historical ties among the Caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action.[51] These attempts at regionalization reflect the nations' desires to compete in the international economic system.[51]</p><p>Furthermore, a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region. In recent years the Caribbean has suffered from a lack of U.S. interest. With the end of the Cold War, U.S. security and economic interests have been focused on other areas. As a result there has been a significant reduction in U.S. aid and investment to the Caribbean.[52] The lack of international support for these small, relatively poor states, helped regionalism prosper.</p><p>Following the Cold War another issue of importance in the Caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some Caribbean States due to the United States and European Union's allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other. [clarification needed]</p><p>United States effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The United States under President Bill Clinton launched a challenge in the World Trade Organization against the EU over Europe's preferential program, known as the Lomé Convention, which allowed banana exports from the former colonies of the Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) to enter Europe cheaply.[53] The World Trade Organization sided in the United States' favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to African, Caribbean and Pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the Cotonou Agreement.[54]</p><p>During the US/EU dispute, the United States imposed large tariffs on European Union goods (up to 100%) to pressure Europe to change the agreement with the Caribbean nations in favour of the Cotonou Agreement.[55]</p><p>Farmers in the Caribbean have complained of falling profits and rising costs as the Lomé Convention weakens. Some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of illegal drugs, which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these illegal drugs in North America and Europe.[56][57]</p><p>Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and Association of Caribbean States[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry. One of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the Caribbean Basin has been the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Proposed by CARICOM in 1992, the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region. It was founded in July 1994. The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues unique to the Caribbean Basin. Through coalition building, like the ACS and CARICOM, regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean. The successes of region-building initiatives are still debated by scholars, yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean.</p><p>Venezuela's effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez launched an economic group called the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), which several eastern Caribbean islands joined. In 2012, the nation of Haiti, with 9 million people, became the largest CARICOM nation that sought to join the union.[58]</p><h2>Regional institutions[edit]</h2><p>Here are some of the bodies that several islands share in collaboration:</p><h2>Cuisine[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Caribbean cuisine</p><h3>Favorite or national dishes[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg/220px-FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Doubles, one of the national dishes of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Arroz_con_gandules.jpg/220px-Arroz_con_gandules.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Arroz con gandules, one of the national dishes of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Geography:</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Find more aboutCaribbeanat Wikipedia's sister projects</p><p>Coordinates: 14°31'32?N 75°49'06?W? / ?14.52556°N 75.81833°W? / 14.52556; -75.81833</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

The term Amerindian (short for 'Indians of the Americas) is used in Quebec, the Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean.[24][25][26][27] In Brazil, indígenas or povos indígenas are common if formal-sounding designations, while índio is still the more often-heard term (the noun for the Indian nationality being indiano), and aborígene and nativo being rarely used in Amerindian-specific contexts (e.g. aborígene is usually understood as the ethnonym for Indigenous Australians). Indigenous peoples are commonly known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples, which includes not only First Nations and Arctic Inuit, but also the minority population of First Nations-European mixed-race Métis people[28] who identify culturally and ethnically with indigenous peoplehood. This is contrasted, for instance, to the American Indian-European mixed-race mestizos of Hispanic America (caboclos in Brazil) who, with their larger population (in most Latin American countries constituting either outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities), identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both Europeans and Indigenous Americans, but still considering themselves a subset of the European-derived Hispanic or Brazilian peoplehood in culture and ethnicity (cf. ladinos).</p><p>Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians, and Alaska Natives.[29]</p><p>Application of the term Indian originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies.[30][31][32][33][34][35] Eventually, those islands came to be known as the West Indies, a name still used. This led to the blanket term Indies and Indians (Spanish indios, Portuguese índios) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced by many over the last two centuries.[citation needed] Even though the term Indian generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas—such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years ago, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East—these groups are nonetheless considered indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Portuguese and Spanish equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, indios filipinos.</p><p>Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.[36] Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting, and gathering. In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, chiefdoms, states, and empires.</p><p>Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Greenland, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guaraní, Mayan languages, and Nahuatl, count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, social organization, and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects, but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from Western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples.</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>History[edit]</h2><h3>Migration into the continents[edit]</h3><p>For more details on theories of the migrations of the Paleo-Indians, see settlement of the Americas.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg/200px-Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg" width="200" height="126"><br><p>Illustration of Paleo-Indians hunting a glyptodont</p><p>The specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are the subject of ongoing research and discussion.[37][38] According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.[37] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of Beringia that joined Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska).[39][40] Alaska was a glacial refugium because it had low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of North America, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.[41][42]</p><p>Indigenous genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia.[43][44] The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10–20,000 years.[45][46][47] Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.[38][48][49] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets.[50]</p><p>Another route proposed involves migration – either on foot or using primitive boats – along the Pacific Northwest coast to the south, including as far as South America.[51] Archeological evidence of the latter would have been covered by the sea level rise of more than 120 meters since the last ice age.[52]</p><p>The time range of 40,000–16,500 years ago is debatable and probably will remain so for years to come.[37][38] The few agreements achieved to date include:[53][54]</p><p>Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Archaeologists and anthropologists have studied differences among these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods.[56] The Clovis culture, the earliest definitively-dated Paleo-Indians in the Americas, appears around 11,500 RCBP (radiocarbon years Before Present[57]), equivalent to 13,500 to 13,000 calendar years ago.</p><p>In 2014, the autosomal DNA was sequenced of a 12,500+-year-old infant from Montana, whose remains were found in close association with several Clovis artifacts.[58] These are the Anzick-1 remains from the Anzick Clovis burial in Montana. The data indicate that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America. Hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas were ruled out.[58] After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named 'Naia' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called sistema Sac Actun in Mexico's eastern Yucatán Peninsula. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.[59]</p><p>Pre-Columbian era[edit]

Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant European and African arrivals (ca. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through oral history and through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period, and were documented in historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, and Nahua peoples, had their own written languages and records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs, and burned many pre-Columbian written records. Only a few documents remained hidden and survived, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations before and at the time of European encounter had achieved great complexity and many accomplishments.[64] For instance, the Aztecs built one of the largest cities in the world, Tenochtitlan, the ancient site of Mexico City, with an estimated population of 200,000. American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics. The domestication of maize or corn required thousands of years of selective breeding, and continued cultivation of multiple varieties was done with planning and selection, generally by women.</p><p>Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and American Indian creation myths tell of a variety of origins of their respective peoples. Some were always there or were created by gods or animals, some migrated from a specified compass point, and others came from across the ocean.[65]</p><h3>European colonization[edit]</h3><p>Main article: European colonization of the Americas
See also: Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas and Columbian Exchange</p><br><br><p>Cultural areas of North America at time of European contact</p><p>The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the native peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera, which the early explorers brought from Europe and which spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. Conflicts between colonists and indigenous people exacerbated the loss of lives. Colonists frequently[quantify] perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.[66][67][68] According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.[69]</p><p>The first indigenous group encountered by Columbus, the 250,000 Taínos of Hispaniola, represented the dominant culture in the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Within thirty years about 70% of the Taínos had died.[70] They had no immunity to European diseases, so outbreaks of measles and smallpox ravaged their population.[71] Increasing punishment of the Taínos for revolting against forced labour, despite measures put in place by the encomienda, which included religious education and protection from warring tribes,[72] eventually led to the last great Taíno rebellion (1511–1529).</p><p>Following years of mistreatment, the Taínos began to adopt suicidal behaviors, with women aborting or killing their infants and men jumping from cliffs or ingesting untreated cassava, a violent poison.[70] Eventually, a Taíno Cacique named Enriquillo managed to hold out in the Baoruco Mountain Range for thirteen years, causing serious damage to the Spanish, Carib-held plantations and their Indian auxiliaries.[73][not in citation given] Hearing of the seriousness of the revolt, Emperor Charles V (also King of Spain) sent captain Francisco Barrionuevo to negotiate a peace treaty with the ever-increasing number of rebels. Two months later, after consultation with the Audencia of Santo Domingo, Enriquillo was offered any part of the island to live in peace.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in America, particularly with regard to native Indians. The laws forbade the maltreatment of natives and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.[74] The Spanish crown found it difficult to enforce these laws in distant colonies.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/FlorentineCodex_BK12_F54_smallpox.jpg/220px-FlorentineCodex_BK12_F54_smallpox.jpg" width="220" height="170"><br><p>Drawing accompanying text in Book XII of the 16th-century Florentine Codex (compiled 1540–1585), showing Nahuas of conquest-era central Mexico suffering from smallpox</p><p>Various theories for the decline of the Native American populations emphasize epidemic diseases, conflicts with Europeans, and conflicts among warring tribes. Scholars[which?] now[when?] believe that, among the various contributing factors, epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives.[75][76] Some[quantify] believe that after first contacts with Europeans and Africans, Old World diseases caused the deaths of 90 to 95% of the native population of the New World in the following 150 years.[77] Smallpox killed up to one third of the native population of Hispaniola in 1518.[78] By killing the Incan ruler Huayna Capac, smallpox caused the Inca Civil War of 1529–1532. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Typhus (probably) in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, measles in 1618—all ravaged the remains of Inca culture.</p><p>Smallpox killed millions of native inhabitants of Mexico.[79][80] Unintentionally introduced at Veracruz with the arrival of Pánfilo de Narváez on April 23, 1520, smallpox ravaged Mexico in the 1520s,[81] possibly killing over 150,000 in Tenochtitlán (the heartland of the Aztec Empire) alone, and aiding in the victory of Hernán Cortés over the Aztec Empire at Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City) in 1521.[citation needed]</p><p>Over the centuries the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous Americans had no immunity.[82]</p><p>Exploration of the Caribbean led to the discovery of the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles. Their culture was destroyed by 1650. Only 500 had survived by the year 1550, though the bloodlines continued through to the modern populace. In Amazonia, indigenous societies weathered centuries of colonization.[83]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/%C3%8Dndios_em_uma_fazenda.jpg/220px-%C3%8Dndios_em_uma_fazenda.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>Indians visiting a Brazilian farm plantation in Minas Gerais ca. 1824</p><p>Contact with European diseases such as smallpox and measles killed between 50 and 67 per cent of the aboriginal population of North America in the first hundred years after the arrival of Europeans.[84] Some 90 per cent of the native population near Massachusetts Bay Colony died of smallpox in an epidemic in 1617–1619.[85] In 1633, in Fort Orange (New Netherland), the Native Americans there were exposed to smallpox because of contact with Europeans. As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population-groups of Native Americans.[86] It reached Lake Ontario in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679.[87][88] During the 1770s smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.[89] The 1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic and the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic brought devastation and drastic population depletion among the Plains Indians.[90][91] In 1832 the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans (The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832).[92][93]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The indigenous peoples in Brazil declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated three million[94] to some 300,000 in 1997.[dubious – discuss][not in citation given][95]</p><p>The Spanish Empire and other Europeans re-introduced horses to the Americas. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.[96] The re-introduction of the horse, extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on Native American culture in the Great Plains of North America and in Patagonia in South America. By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture game, especially bison.</p><h2>Agriculture[edit]</h2><p>See also: Agriculture in Mesoamerica and Incan agriculture</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Buffalo_Hunt.jpg/220px-Buffalo_Hunt.jpg" width="220" height="153"><br><p>A bison hunt depicted by George Catlin</p><p>Over time and thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[97] In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.</p><p>The South American highlands were a center of early agriculture. Genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern Peru,[98] from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex. Over 99% of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south-central Chile,[99] Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago.[100][101] According to George Raudzens, It is clear that in pre-Columbian times some groups struggled to survive and often suffered food shortages and famines, while others enjoyed a varied and substantial diet.[102] The persistent drought around 850 AD coincided with the collapse of Classic Maya civilization, and the famine of One Rabbit (AD 1454) was a major catastrophe in Mexico.[103]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg/220px-Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg" width="220" height="148"><br><p>Andenes in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Peru. The Incan agricultural terraces are still used by many of the Incas' descendents, Quechua-speaking Andean farmers.</p><p>Natives of North America began practicing farming approximately 4,000 years ago, late in the Archaic period of North American cultures. Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.[104]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the Mississippi River valley, Europeans noted Native Americans' managed groves of nut and fruit trees not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields. Further away, prescribed burning would have been used in forest and prairie areas.[105]</p><p>Many crops first domesticated by indigenous Americans are now produced and used globally. Chief among these is maize or corn, arguably the most important crop in the world.[106] Other significant crops include cassava, chia, squash (pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, acorn squash, butternut squash), the pinto bean, Phaseolus beans including most common beans, tepary beans and lima beans, tomatoes, potatoes, avocados, peanuts, cocoa beans (used to make chocolate), vanilla, strawberries, pineapples, Peppers (species and varieties of Capsicum, including bell peppers, jalapeños, paprika and chili peppers) sunflower seeds, rubber, brazilwood, chicle, tobacco, coca, manioc and some species of cotton.</p><p>Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management, including agro-forestry practices among Itza Maya in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the Menominee of Wisconsin, suggest that longstanding sacred values may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.[107]</p><h2>Culture[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Quechuawomanandchild.jpg/220px-Quechuawomanandchild.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Andes, Peru</p><p>Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a cultural area is Mesoamerica, where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><p>The languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area. Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the Chippewas and Delawares.[108]</p><h3>Writing systems[edit]</h3><p>See also: Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, Cherokee syllabary, and Quipu</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg/220px-Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg" width="220" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in Palenque, Mexico</p><p>The development of writing is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block. The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane.[109]</p><p>The Maya writing system was a combination of phonetic syllabic symbols and logograms—that is, it was a logosyllabic writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different glyphs, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.[110][111][112]</p><p>The Zapotec writing system is one of the earliest writing systems in the Americas.[113] The oldest example of the Zapotec script is a monument discovered in San José Mogote, dating from around from 600 BCE.[114] Zapotec writing was logographic and presumably syllabic.[113] The remains of the Zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture. There are only a few extant inscriptions, which makes study of this writing system difficult.</p><p>Aztec codices (singular codex) are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era Aztecs. These codices provide some of the best primary sources for Aztec culture. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.[115] The colonial era codices not only contain Aztec pictograms, but also Classical Nahuatl (in the Latin alphabet), Spanish, and occasionally Latin.</p><p>Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there is a large number of local-level documents in Nahuatl, Zapotec, Mixtec, and Yucatec Maya from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.[116] The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the New Philology to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.[117]</p><p>The Wiigwaasabak, birch bark scrolls on which the Ojibwa (Anishinaabe) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics.</p><p>Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply syllabics, is a family of abugidas used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the Algonquian, Inuit, and Athabaskan language families.</p><h3>Music and art[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas and Native American music</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg/220px-Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg" width="220" height="367"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Apache fiddle made by Chesley Goseyun Wilson (San Carlos Apache)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Gorget%2C_Peru%2C_north_coast%2C_Chimu_style%2C_c._1350-1450_AD%2C_feathers%2C_reeds%2C_copper_bars%2C_silver%2C_metal_overlaid_with_skin_-_Textile_Museum%2C_George_Washington_University_-_DSC09898.JPG/220px-thumbnail.jpg" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Chimu culture feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350–1450 CE</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/JuPi_1.jpg/220px-JuPi_1.jpg" width="220" height="313"><br><p>Textile art by Julia Pingushat (Inuk, Arviat, Nunavut Territory, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995</p><p>Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.[citation needed]</p><p>The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often pentatonic. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and wind instruments such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and rain tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European musical instruments; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.[118][dead link]</p><p>Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas comprise a major category in the world art collection. Contributions include pottery, paintings, jewellery, weavings, sculptures, basketry, carvings, and beadwork.[119] Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives[120] in order to profit from the cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe. To support the ongoing practice of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States,[121] the Ford Foundation, arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.[122][123]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png/220px-Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png" width="220" height="234"><br><p>This map shows the percentage of indigenous population in different countries of the Americas.</p><p>The following table provides estimates for each country in the Americas of the populations of indigenous people and those with partial indigenous ancestry, each expressed as a percentage of the overall population.

They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of empowered caciques to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.[153] While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged people identifying as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s.[154] Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted grassroots territorial organizations; these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas.</p><p>Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages.

Eskimo is considered derogatory in many other places because it was given by non-Inuit people and was said to mean eater of raw meat.[165] Hundreds of Aboriginal nations evolved trade, spiritual and social hierarchies. The Métis ethnicity developed a culture, especially in the area of the Red River of the North, from the mid-17th century after generations of First Nations and native Inuit married European settlers. They were small farmers, hunters and trappers, and usually Catholic and French-speaking.[166] The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period.[167] Various laws, treaties, and legislation have been enacted between European-Canadians and First Nations across Canada. Aboriginal Right to Self-Government provides the opportunity for First Nations to manage their own historical, cultural, political, health care and economic control within their communities.</p><br><img alt="Colour photograph of Tsuu T'ina children in traditional costume on horseback at a Stampede Parade in front of an audience" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Tsuu_Tsina_parade.JPG/220px-Tsuu_Tsina_parade.JPG" width="220" height="133"><br><p>Tsuu T'ina children at a parade</p><p>Although not without conflict, European/Canadian early interactions in the east with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful compared to the later experience of native peoples in the United States.[168] Combined with a late economic development in many regions,[169] this relatively peaceful history resulted in Indigenous peoples having a fairly strong influence on the early national culture, while preserving their own identity.[170] From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into the mainstream European-influenced culture, which they referred to as Canadian culture.[171] The government attempted forced integration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[172] National Aboriginal Day recognises the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples of Canada.[173] There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands encompassing 1,172,790 2006 people spread across Canada, with distinctive Aboriginal cultures, languages, art, and music.[174][175][176]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Chile[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Indigenous peoples in Chile</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Hombre_%26_mujer_Mapuche.jpg/220px-Hombre_%26_mujer_Mapuche.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Mapuche man and woman.

The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and fertile land that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other lands like Guatemala or Mexico, but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by Pedro de Alvarado along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people.

				This article is about the continent. For the politico-economic union, see European Union. For other uses, see Europe (disambiguation).</p><p>Europe —a concept dating back to classical antiquity— is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The eastern boundary with Asia is an arbitrary historical and social construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. The primarily physiographic term continent as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities and lines of demarcation are not reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries with Asia. Europe is considered by historical convention as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.[5]</p><p>Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 740&nbsp;million (about 11% of world population) as of 2015[update].[6] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.</p><p>Europe, in particular ancient Greece, was the birthplace of Western civilization.[7][8][9] The fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the migration period, marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. From the Age of Discovery onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the majority of Asia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[10] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>In 1955, the Council of Europe was formed following a speech by Sir Winston Churchill, with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all states except for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Vatican City. Further European integration by some states led to the formation of the European Union, a separate political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation.[11] The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The European Anthem is Ode to Joy and states celebrate peace and unity on Europe Day.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Name</h2><p>Further information: Europa (mythology)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Herodotus_World_Map.jpg/330px-Herodotus_World_Map.jpg" width="330" height="193"><br><p>Reconstruction of Herodotus' world map (450 BC)</p><p>In classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient&nbsp;Greek: ????p?, Eur?pe) is the name of either a Phoenician princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements e???? (eurús), wide, broad[12] and ?? (ops, gen. ?p??, opós) eye, face, countenance,[13] hence their composite Eur?pe would mean wide-gazing or broad of aspect. Broad has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.[14] For the second part compare also the divine attributes of grey-eyed Athena (??a???p??, glaukopis) or ox-eyed Hera (ß??p??, boopis).</p><p>There have been attempts to connect Eur?pe to a Semitic term for west, this being either Akkadian erebu meaning to go down, set (said of the sun) or Phoenician 'ereb evening, west,[15] which is at the origin of Arabic Maghreb and Hebrew ma'arav. Michael A. Barry, professor in Princeton University's Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of night, [the country of] sunset, in opposition to Asu [the country of] sunrise, i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to cartographic convention appears in Greek ??at??? (Anatol? [sun] rise, east, hence Anatolia).[16] Martin Litchfield West stated that phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor.[17] Next to these hypotheses there is also a Proto-Indo-European root *h1reg?os, meaning darkness, which also produced Greek Erebus.</p><p>Most major world languages use words derived from Eur?pe or Europa to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word Ouzhou (??/??); a similar Chinese-derived term Oshu (??) is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, Oshu Rengo (????), despite the katakana Yoroppa (?????) being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan (land of the Franks) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa.[18]</p><h2>Definition</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Further information: List of transcontinental countries and Boundaries between continents</p><h3>Contemporary definition</h3><p>Clickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries[19]

Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.[20]</p><p>Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Europe as used specifically in British English may also refer to Continental Europe exclusively.[22]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg/220px-T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg" width="220" height="220"><br><p>A medieval T and O map from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah — Asia to Sem (Shem), Europe to Iafeth (Japheth), and Africa to Cham (Ham)</p><p>The first recorded usage of Eur?pe as a geographic term is in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, in reference to the western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni River) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC.[23] Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.[24] Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.[25] The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.[26]</p><p>The convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[27] Strabo[28] and Ptolemy,[29] who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.</p><p>The term Europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world.</p><p>A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.[30] The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: Europa often[dubious – discuss] figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.[31]</p><p>Modern definitions

But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the Volga–Don Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.</p><p>Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains.[32] introducing the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard.[33]</p><p>The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[34][35] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.</p><p>By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.[36]</p><p>In Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[37] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[38] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[39] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest[40] and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Main article: History of Europe</p><h3>Prehistory</h3><p>Main article: Prehistoric Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lascaux_painting.jpg/260px-Lascaux_painting.jpg" width="260" height="170"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Paleolithic cave paintings from Lascaux in France (c 15,000 BC)</p><p>Homo erectus georgicus, which lived roughly 1.8&nbsp;million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe.[41] Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1&nbsp;million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[42] Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and their final refuge being present-day Portugal.

Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs.[45] The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.[46][47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BC in Greece with the Minoan civilization on Crete, the first advanced civilization in Europe.[48] The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BC, ushering the European Iron Age.[49] Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BC gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BC, the year the first Olympic Games.[50]</p><p>Main article: Classical antiquity

Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.[51] The Greeks city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece.[51] In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.[52] The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;[53] in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.[54][55][56] In the course of the 5th century BC, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,[57] as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/RomanEmpire_117.svg/260px-RomanEmpire_117.svg.png" width="260" height="191"><br><p>The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg/170px-Augustus_Bevilacqua_Glyptothek_Munich_317.jpg" width="170" height="246"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Augustus wearing the Civic Crown</p><p>Greece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation.[51] Expanding from their base in Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe by the turn of the millennium. The Roman Republic ended in 27 BC, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire. The two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe.[58]</p><p>The empire continued to expand under emperors such as Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, who spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.[59][60] The Empire began to decline in the 3rd century, particularly in the west. Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 AD after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople in his honour (modern-day Istanbul) in 330 AD. Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 AD, and in 391-392 AD, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.[61] This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 AD;[62] or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century AD.</p><p>Main articles: Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages

There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans and Magyars.[58] Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the Dark Ages.[63] Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.[64]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia, and brought the Christian church under state control.[65]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Rolandfealty.jpg/160px-Rolandfealty.jpg" width="160" height="178"><p>Roland pledges fealty to Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Delegation_of_Croats_and_Serbs_to_Emperor_Basil_I%2C_Skylitzes.jpg/160px-Delegation_of_Croats_and_Serbs_to_Emperor_Basil_I%2C_Skylitzes.jpg" width="160" height="79"><p>Delegations of Croats and Serbs at Byzantine court of Basil I</p><p>From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.[66] Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.[67] Between 711 and 720, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule&nbsp;— save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance.</p><p>During the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.[68] Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis&nbsp;I.[69] Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.[70]</p><p>East Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state.[71][72] Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.[73]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>High and Late Middle Ages</h3><p>Main articles: High Middle Ages, Late Middle Ages, and Middle Ages

Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.[74] A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament.[75] The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.[74]</p><p>The Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.[76] In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula.[77]</p><p>In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.[78] The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.[79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87] Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.[88][89][90]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mongols_suzdal.jpg/170px-Mongols_suzdal.jpg" width="170" height="272"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan in 1238, during the Mongol invasion of Europe.</p><p>In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.[91] Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.[92] The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.[93][94] After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.[95] From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.</p><p>The Great Famine of 1315–1317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.[96] The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.[97][98] Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,[99] and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.[100] Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25&nbsp;million people in Europe alone—a third of the European population at the time.[101]</p><p>The plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, foreigners, beggars and lepers.[102] The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.[103] During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe.[104]</p><p>Main article: Early modern period

The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.[114] This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.[115] In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe.[116]</p><p>The 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline.[117] Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.[118] From the Union of Krewo (1385) central and eastern Europe was dominated by Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Between 1648 and 1655 in the central and eastern Europe ended hegemony of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.[119] Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia). Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, laying siege to Vienna in 1529. In the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean. The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the Battle of Vienna permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe.</p><p>The Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development.[120] Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Isaac Newton.[121] According to Peter Barrett, It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.[105]</p><p>In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Portugal and Spain, two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.[122][123] Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia.[124] France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>18th and 19th centuries</h3><p>Main article: Modern history

These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.[135] The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities.[136]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png/170px-The_ottoman_empire_and_its_successors_%281923%29_-_Ottoman_Empire_in_1856.png" width="170" height="203"><br><p>Ottoman Europe in 1856</p><p>In parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774).

The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.[156]</p><p>Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.[157] In 1932–1933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths;[158] surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937–38 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;[159] millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union.[160]</p><p>The social revolutions sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following The Great War: in 1919, with the Weimar Republic in Germany, and the First Austrian Republic; in 1922, with Mussolini's one party fascist government in the Kingdom of Italy, and in Ataturk's Turkish Republic, adopting the Western alphabet, and state secularism. Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler in power of what became Nazi Germany.[161][162]</p><p>In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of appeasement.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Hamburg_after_the_1943_bombing.jpg/220px-Hamburg_after_the_1943_bombing.jpg" width="220" height="166"><br><p>Bombed and burned-out buildings in Hamburg, 1944/45</p><p>With tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig, the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of World War II.[163][164] The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a bombing offensive on Britain, but failed to convince the Britons to give up.[165] In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the Operation Barbarossa.[166] On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire and other allied forces.[167][168]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Yalta_Conference_%28Churchill%2C_Roosevelt%2C_Stalin%29_%28B%26W%29.jpg/220px-Yalta_Conference_%28Churchill%2C_Roosevelt%2C_Stalin%29_%28B%26W%29.jpg" width="220" height="181"><br><p>The "Big Three" at the Yalta Conference in 1945; seated (from the left): Winston Churchill, Franklin D.

The Battle of Kursk, which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. In 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60&nbsp;million dead across the world.[169] More than 40&nbsp;million people in Europe had died as a result of World War II,[170] including between 11 and 17&nbsp;million people who perished during the Holocaust.[171] The Soviet Union lost around 27&nbsp;million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties.[172] By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40&nbsp;million refugees.[173] Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20&nbsp;million people.[174]</p><p>World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an Iron Curtain. The United States and Western Europe established the NATO alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact.[175]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e9/Schuman_Declaration.jpg/290px-Schuman_Declaration.jpg" width="290" height="213"><br><p>The Schuman Declaration led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. It began the integration process of the European Union (9 May 1950, at the French Foreign Ministry).</p><p>The two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.[10] In the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.[161]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/200px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png" width="200" height="133"><br><p>Flag of Europe, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1955 as the flag for the whole of Europe.[176]</p><p>European integration also grew after World War II. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.[177] In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom formed the European Community, which in 1993 became the European Union. The EU established a parliament, court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency.[178] Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.[179]</p><h2>Geography</h2><p>Main article: Geography of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Europe_topography_map_en.png/220px-Europe_topography_map_en.png" width="220" height="179"><br><p>Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions</p><p>Europe makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass.[20] It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.[180] Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.[181] Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.</p><p>This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.</p><h3>Climate</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Climate of Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Vegetation_Europe.png/220px-Vegetation_Europe.png" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Biomes of Europe and surrounding regions:

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.[182] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed Europe's central heating, because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;°C (61&nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&nbsp;°C (54&nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude.

Along with fellow cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, he is credited with drafting the first world map that named America as a land mass.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Biography[edit]</h2><p>Ringmann was born in Eichhoffen, Alsace in 1482. He became a schoolmaster and was often described as a poet.</p><p>Around 1503, Ringmann visited Italy. There, he learned about the newly discovered western lands and the explorations that took place within them. These lands were initially known as the New World, and were later named the Americas. He also came to believe that Amerigo Vespucci had discovered South America.</p><p>Upon his return, Ringmann moved to Saint-Dié-des-Vosges in Lorraine with his friend, Martin Waldseemüller, a cartographer with whom he was working on a new Latin edition of Ptolemy's treatise on geography. Waldseemüller drew the maps while Ringmann edited the translation and wrote the preface. Ringmann was probably also the author of the introduction to Waldseemüller's great map and globe of the world, yet many historians attribute the work to Waldseemüller himself. Some historians have judged that Walter Ludd, the head of the Gymnasium Vosagense, paid Ringmann and Waldseemüller to do this work for publication at the Gymnasium's printing press at St. Dié.</p><p>Ringmann also may have read the French edition of Vespucci's letters, (Quatre Navigations d' Americ Vespuce). Since Vespucci's written accounts were in Italian, the translation to French could have been the source of Ringmann's misunderstanding of the accepted discoverer of the New World, as he believed that Vespucci discovered the new world. He described this in his introduction:</p><p>There is a fourth quarter of the world which Amerigo Vespucci has discovered and which for this reason we can call 'America' or the land of Americus [the Latin version of the Italian name Amerigo]. […] We do not see why the name of the man of genius, Amerigo, who has discovered them, should not be given to these lands, as Europe and Asia have adopted the names of women.</p><p>When the book was published by the name Cosmographiae Introductio on April 25, 1507, it was the first time that the word 'Americas' appeared in print. Waldseemüller corrected the error in a later edition and named South America Terra Nova, but the name America had now already been established.</p><p>Ringmann corrected the texts of the Latin editions of Ptolemy's geography—which had been published previously at Rome and Ulm using a Greek manuscript borrowed from Italy (Codex Vaticanum Graecorum 191.) During this time, Waldseemüller edited the Ptolemaic maps and also added twenty new maps to the collection. This was what was known as the first modern atlas of the world.</p><p>In 1508, Ringmann made the first translation of Julius Caesar's Commentaries into German with supplemental pieces by Suetonius, Plutarch, and others. One year later, he published a card game, Grammatica Figurata, to make the grammatical rules of Donatus', Ars Minor, more appealing to children. He died in 1511 in Sélestat.</p><h2>Grammatica Figurata[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/GrammaticaFigurata2.gif/220px-GrammaticaFigurata2.gif" width="220" height="282"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Grammatica Figurata (1509)</p><p>The Grammatica Figurata was first published by Mathias Ringmann in 1509. This work was an attempt to enliven Donatus' Ars Minor by printing up illustrated card sets for each grammatical rule. Apparently the children would have a card set. The rules are not explained at length, but a few hints are scattered here and there in the work. The final section on Exclamations has a sentence on how to figure out which student has won. Each card represented a part of speech, a gender, a case, or a tense, etc. Depending upon the teacher's questions a student would play the appropriate card or cards. Long believed to be lost, one copy of Grammatica figurata was found and reprinted in 1905.[2] Of particular interest are Ringmann's digressions on assorted subjects, from the prevalence of gambling among the German priesthood to the reasons behind his refusal to illustrate full-frontal nudity.</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><li id="cite_note-3">^ Jennie, Cohen.

An accountant as a young man, his means were such that he was able to pursue his interests as a naturalist and antiquarian. He was a member of a number of societies, often assuming leadership positions. Hudd is perhaps best known for his roles as author of Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District, editor of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, supervisor of the excavations undertaken by the Caerwent Exploration Fund, and author of Richard Ameryk and the name America.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background[edit]</h2><p>Alfred Edmund Hudd, son of leather merchant Samuel Hudd and his wife Mary Ann, was born in the second quarter of 1846 in Clifton.[1][2] An accountant, he married Catharine Bowles Edmonds in the first quarter of 1872, their marriage recorded in the registration district of Faringdon, Berkshire.[3] In 1881, Alfred and his wife resided at Clinton House on Pembroke Road in Clifton.[4]</p><h2>Naturalist[edit]</h2><p>By 1870, Hudd was a member of the Bristol Naturalists' Society, which had been founded in 1862.[5][6] He was first appointed to the Council of the society on 6 May 1875, and remained a member of the Council for years, until about 1892.[7][8][9] After a hiatus as a Council member for several years, Hudd was reappointed to the Council in 1899, where he remained until at least 1901.[10] He specialised in entomology. His Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of the Bristol District was published in six parts in the Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society:</p><p>Hudd was also a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London, founded in 1833, and now known as the Royal Entomological Society of London.[17][18] In 1912, he presented his collection of 1300 coleoptera (beetle) specimens to the Bristol Museum and Library, now the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, to supplement the Stephen Barton (d. 1898) collection. His collection of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) specimens was added to the George C. Griffiths (1852–1924) collection at the Bristol Museum.[18] Hudd also contributed a short chapter on The Insects of the Bristol District to the Handbook to Bristol and the neighbourhood.[19]</p><h2>Antiquarian[edit]</h2><p>Hudd was elected secretary of the Clifton Antiquarian Club at its first meeting on 23 January 1884 at the Bristol Museum and Library.[20] He retained that position during all twenty-eight years of the original society. Not only a founding member of the club, Alfred Edmund Hudd had the distinction of being the only member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club to remain with the original organisation from its inception in 1884 to its end in 1912. He served as editor of the society's seven volumes of Proceedings,[21] also contributing 21 papers.[22] His service to the organisation was acknowledged on 5 January 1898 when the club presented him with a silver bowl and a set of four silver candlesticks.[23] In 1911, the membership of the club again paid tribute to his efforts, with an inscribed, inlaid grandfather clock.[21]</p><p>Alfred Hudd was a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and served on its Council.[24][25] On 9 August 1904, he was elected to membership of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland at a meeting of that organisation held at Tuam, County Galway.[26] In addition, he was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27]</p><h2>Caerwent Exploration Fund[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg/160px-Roman_Remains_-_Caerwent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_837510.jpg" width="160" height="213"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Excavations at Caerwent in south Wales</p><p>Alfred Hudd was closely involved with the Caerwent Exploration Fund. At a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in February 1899, Alfred Trice Martin, also a founding member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, suggested that a systematic excavation of Caerwent, a Roman town in south Wales, be undertaken.[27] The Caerwent Exploration Fund was established by the Clifton Antiquarian Club soon thereafter. In September 1899, at Caerwent, Godfrey Morgan, Lord Tredegar, was elected President of the Caerwent Exploration Fund and Alfred Hudd was elected Treasurer.[27][28] Hudd and Thomas Ashby, Junior, both members of the Executive Committee of the Fund, supervised the excavations at Caerwent.[29] During the period between 1899 and 1913, two-thirds of the Roman town in south Wales was revealed. The archive of Caerwent, which was discovered during the excavations by the Fund, is in the archaeology collection of Newport Museum.[29] The reports on the excavations at Caerwent were published in Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[27] Much of the success of the Caerwent Exploration Fund has been attributed to Alfred Hudd.[30]</p><h2>The naming of America[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Stradanus_America.jpg/220px-Stradanus_America.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>America by Johannes Stradanus
(1523–1605). "Americus rediscovers America. He called her but once and thenceforth she was always awake."[31]</p><p>The traditional theory of the naming of America is that it was named in honour of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator. At the turn of the sixteenth century, Vespucci undertook a series of voyages (the number of which remains unresolved) in search of a western passage to the Indies. After the voyage of 1501–1502, he proposed that the areas that he and, separately, Christopher Columbus had explored were not part of Asia, but rather a New World.[32][33] America first received its name in the Cosmographiae Introductio, published by cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in 1507. Vespucci's published letters (the authenticity of which is contested) were the inspiration for that work, which was authored by a group of scholars in Saint-Dié, Lorraine, France. They revised Ptolemy's Geography to include the New World and reasoned that, as the three previously known continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, had feminine names, so should the New World. Accordingly, the feminised version of the Latin form of the baptismal name of the discoverer of the New World, Vespucci, was utilised.[32][33] The appendix of the book included Waldseemüller's map of the world in which the New World was labelled America. The map, rediscovered in a German castle in 1901, was the first to use the name America and the first to depict a Western Hemisphere.[33][34] The Library of Congress purchased the 1507 Waldseemüller map in 2003. On 30 April 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel transferred the map, also known as America's birth certificate, to the people of the United States in a ceremony at the Library of Congress.[35]</p><p>There are several alternate theories of the naming of America.[33] Alfred Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings. In Richard Ameryk and the name America, Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498–1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from King Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for handing over the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503).[33][36] Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Further, Hudd quoted a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497.[33][36]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This year (1497), on St. John the Baptist's day (June 24th), the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristow, in a ship of Bristowe called the 'Mathew,' the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe the 2nd of May and came home again the 6th August following.[36]</p><p>Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 Cosmographiae Introductio, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci.[33][36] While Hudd's speculation has found support from more than one 21st century author, there is no hard proof to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk.[33][37][38]</p><h2>Later life[edit]</h2><p>Hudd's first wife Kate died on 4 April 1889 and was buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery in Naples, Italy.[39] Hudd married Adeline Sophia Tyzack in the fourth quarter of 1891 in the registration district of Kensington, London.[3] In 1901, he resided at 94 Pembroke Road in Clifton with his second wife Adeline and two daughters.[40] Alfred Edmund Hudd of 108 Pembroke Road in Clifton died on 7 October 1920, his death registered in Bristol in the fourth quarter of the year. His estate of almost £16,000 went to probate on 17 December 1920. His wife survived him.[41][42]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

				This article is about the explorer. For other uses, see Amerigo Vespucci (disambiguation).</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci (Italian pronunciation:&nbsp;[ame'ri?go ves'putt?i]; March 9, 1454&nbsp;– February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to Old Worlders.</p><p>Colloquially referred to as the New World, this second super continent came to be termed Americas, deriving its name from Americus, the Latin version of Vespucci's first name.[1][2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background</h2><br><br><p>The birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was born and raised in Florence on the Italian Peninsula. He was the third son of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci, a Florentine notary, and Lisabetta Mini.[3][4] The father of Ser Nastagio (Anastasio) Vespucci had the name Amerigo Vespucci also. [5]</p><p>Amerigo Vespucci was educated by his uncle, Fra Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican friar of the monastery of San Marco in Florence. While his elder brothers were sent to the University of Pisa to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a mercantile life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial house of Medici, headed by Lorenzo de' Medici. Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492. In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in Cádiz (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.[3] In April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, the Crown of Castile broke their monopoly deal with Christopher Columbus and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the West Indies. Just around this time (1495–96), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.[3] After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.[3]</p><h2>Expeditions</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>At the invitation of king Manuel I of Portugal, Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of South America between 1499 and 1502. On the first of these voyages he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.</p><p>The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1504. In 1507, Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the new continent America after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus. In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset Christopher Columbus' glory. However, the rediscovery in the 18th century of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts, notably the Soderini Letter, could be fabrications, not by Vespucci, but by others.[citation needed]</p><h2>Historical role</h2><p>In 1508, the position of chief of navigation of Spain (piloto mayor de Indias) was created for Vespucci, with the responsibility of planning navigation for voyages to the Indies.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg/200px-Vespucci_arrives_in_New_World.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Vespucci's first encounter with Native Americans in Honduras, 1497 (De Bry's illustration, c.1592)</p><p>Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. Mundus Novus (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from Lisbon to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501–1502. Mundus Novus was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and soon reprinted and distributed in numerous European countries.[6] Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi (Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages), known as Lettera al Soderini or just Lettera, was a letter in Italian addressed to Piero Soderini. Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German Martin Waldseemüller in 1507 in Cosmographiae Introductio, a book on cosmography and geography, as Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).[6]</p><p>On March 22, 1508, King Ferdinand made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary[7] and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg/200px-Cannibalism_in_the_New_World%2C_from_Vespucci.jpg" width="200" height="133"><br><p>The first known depiction of cannibalism in the New World. Engraving by Johann Froschauer for an edition of Amerigo Vespucci's Mundus Novus, published in Augsburg in 1505</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 18th century, three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered. One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the four voyages. Another was written from Cape Verde in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.[6]</p><p>Some have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent America on his world map of 1507 in Lorraine. Vespucci used a Latinised form of his name, Americus Vespucius, in his Latin writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form America, according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women. It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseemüller had named the continent after him.[8]</p><p>The two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like Germán Arciniegas and Gabriel Camargo Pérez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish Pilot Juan de la Cosa.</p><p>Vespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; its existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication.</p><h2>Voyages</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg/170px-Domenico_ghirlandaio%2C_amerigo_vespucci%2C_ognissanti%2C_Firenze.jpg" width="170" height="297"><br><p>Portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child, part of the Madonna della Misericordia (c. 1472) by Domenico Ghirlandaio at the Ognissanti church in Florence</p><p>The first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabulous, but the second and third are certain.</p><h3>First voyage</h3><p>A letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, modern scholars have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.[9] Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of hammocks and sweat lodges.[10] The names of Amerigo Vespucci's ships were the San Antiago, Repertaga, Wegiz, and the Girmand.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Second voyage</h3><p>About 1499–1500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with Alonso de Ojeda (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the Indian Ocean.[11] After hitting land at the coast of what is now Guyana, the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the Amazon River and reaching 6°S, before turning around and seeing Trinidad and the Orinoco River and returning to Spain by way of Hispaniola. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially [12] on August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,[12] which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.</p><h3>Third voyage</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg/220px-Amerigo_Vespucci_%28with_turban%29.jpg" width="220" height="299"><br><p>Portrait of Vespucci which titles him "discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land"</p><p>The last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by Gonçalo Coelho in 1501–1502 in the service of Portugal. Departing from Lisbon, the fleet sailed first to Cape Verde where they met two of Pedro Álvares Cabral's ships returning from India. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499–1500 voyage.[11] On reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed south along the coast of South America to Rio de Janeiro's bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of Patagonia before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the Río de la Plata, which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day Cananéia at 25° S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif/lossless-page1-250px-%22America%22_%28Engraving%29_Nova_reperta_%28Speculum_diuersarum_imaginum_speculatiuarum_1638%29.tif.png" width="250" height="183"><br><p>Vespucci awakens "America" in a Stradanus engraving (circa 1638)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped Alpha and Beta Centauri, as well as the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula.[13] Although these stars had been known to the ancient Greeks, gradual precession had lowered them below the European horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci wrote in a letter to Medici that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by Ptolemy or Marco Polo and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.[citation needed]</p><h3>Fourth voyage</h3><p>Vespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503–1504 is also disputed to have taken place.[14] The only source of information for the last voyage is the Letter to Soderini,[15] but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip.[b] However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503–04 by the captain Gonçalo Coelho, very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well.[16] However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.</p><p>The letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.[17]</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Vespucci was a cousin of the husband of Simonetta Vespucci. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand marvedis per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.</p><h2>Final years</h2><p>Not long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the pilot major of Spain by Ferdinand II of Aragon in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish House of Trade, based in Seville.</p><p>He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in Seville, Spain.[18][19]</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>a Europeans had long conceptualized the Afro-Eurasian landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: Europe, Asia, and Africa. Once cosmographers realized that the New World was not connected to the Old (but before its true geography was fully mapped), they considered the Americas to be a single, fourth continent.


b The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 Mundus Novus and the 1505 Letter of Soderini, the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924). He proposed the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the "Ridolfi fragment" (Formisiano, 1992: p.37–44) – means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship. The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful. Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp. the first) differing from Arciniegas. Fernández-Armesto (2007: p.128) declares the authenticity question "inconclusive", hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2> </h2><h2>References</h2><h2> </h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Newfoundland (/nju?f?n'lænd/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen) new-f?n-LAND;[5] Spanish: Terranova, French: Terre-Neuve, Mi'kmaq: Taqamkuk, Irish: Talamh an Éisc, Inuttitut: Kallunasillik / Ikkarumikluak[6]) is a large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland, and the most populous part of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It has 29 percent of the province's land area. The island is separated from the Labrador Peninsula by the Strait of Belle Isle and from Cape Breton Island by the Cabot Strait. It blocks the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, creating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the world's largest estuary. Newfoundland's nearest neighbour is the French overseas community of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.</p><p>With an area of 108,860 square kilometres (42,031&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[7] Newfoundland is the world's 16th-largest island, Canada's fourth-largest island, and the largest Canadian island outside the North. The provincial capital, St. John's, is located on the southeastern coast of the island; Cape Spear, just south of the capital, is the easternmost point of North America, excluding Greenland. It is common to consider all directly neighbouring islands such as New World, Twillingate, Fogo and Bell Island to be 'part of Newfoundland' (as distinct from Labrador). By that classification, Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of 111,390 square kilometres (43,008&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).[8]</p><p>According to 2006 official Census Canada statistics, 57% of responding Newfoundland and Labradorians claim British or Irish ancestry, with 43.2% claiming at least one English parent, 21.5% at least one Irish parent, and 7% at least one parent of Scottish origin. Additionally 6.1% claimed at least one parent of French ancestry.[9] The island's total population as of the 2006 census was 479,105.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Long settled by indigenous peoples of the Dorset culture, the island was visited by the Icelandic Viking Leif Eriksson in the 11th century, who called the new land Vinland.[citation needed] The next European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. The island was visited by the Genoese navigator John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto), working under contract to King Henry VII of England on his expedition from Bristol in 1497. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. (After European settlement, colonists first called the island Terra Nova, from New Land in Portuguese and Latin.)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Gilbert_plaque.jpg/150px-Gilbert_plaque.jpg" width="150" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Plaque commemorating Gilbert's founding of the British Empire</p><p>On August 5, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed Newfoundland as England's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I of England, thus officially establishing a fore-runner to the much later British Empire.[10] Newfoundland is considered Britain's oldest colony.[11] At the time of English settlement, the Beothuk inhabited the island.</p><p>While there is archaeological evidence of ancient indigenous peoples on the island, it was abandoned when the Norse arrived from Scandinavia.[citation needed] L'Anse aux Meadows was a Norse settlement near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland (Cape Norman), which has been dated to be approximately 1,000 years old. The site is considered the only undisputed evidence of Pre-Columbian contact between the Old and New Worlds, if the Norse-Inuit contact on Greenland is not counted. There is a second suspected Norse site in Point Rosee. The island is a likely location of Vinland, mentioned in the Viking Chronicles, although this has been disputed.</p><p>The indigenous people on the island at the time of European settlement were the Beothuk, who spoke an Amerindian language of the same name. Later immigrants developed a variety of dialects associated with settlement on the island: Newfoundland English, Newfoundland French.[citation needed] In the 19th century, it also had a dialect of Irish known as Newfoundland Irish.[citation needed] Scottish Gaelic was spoken on the island during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the Codroy Valley area, chiefly by settlers from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.[12] The Gaelic names reflected the association with fishing: in Scottish Gaelic, it was called Eilean a' Trosg, or literally, Island of the Cod.[13] Similarly, the Irish Gaelic name Talamh an Éisc means Land of the Fish.</p><h3>First inhabitants[edit]</h3><p>The first inhabitants of Newfoundland were the Paleo-Eskimo, who have no known link to other groups in Newfoundland history. Little is known about them beyond archeological evidence of early settlements. Evidence of successive cultures have been found. The Late Paleo-Eskimo, or Dorset culture, settled there about 4,000 years ago. They were descendants of migrations of ancient prehistoric peoples across the High Arctic thousands of years ago, after crossing from Siberia via the Bering land bridge. The Dorset died off or abandoned the island prior to the arrival of the Norse.[citation needed]</p><p>After this period, the Beothuk settled Newfoundland, migrating from Labrador on the mainland. There is no evidence that the Beothuk inhabited the island prior to Norse settlement. Scholars believe that the Beothuk are related closely to the Innu of Labrador.[citation needed] The tribe later became extinct although people of partial Beothuk descent have been documented[citation needed]. The name Beothuk means people in their own language which is a member of the Algonquian language family which itself is common to many Atlantic coastal tribes.</p><p>The tribe is now extinct but evidence of its culture is preserved in museum, historical and archaeological records. Shanawdithit, a woman who is often regarded as the last full-blood Beothuk, died in St. John's in 1829 of tuberculosis. However, Santu Toney, who was born around 1835 and died in 1910, was a woman of mixed Mi'kmaq and Beothuk descent which means that some Beothuk must have lived on beyond 1829. Her father was a Beothuk and mother a Mi'kmaq, both from Newfoundland. The Beothuk may have intermingled and assimilated with Innu in Labrador and Mi'kmaq in Newfoundland. Oral histories also suggest potential historical competition and hostility between the Beothuk and Mi'kmaq.[citation needed] The Mi'kmaq, Innu and Inuit all hunted and fished around Newfoundland before the arrival of Europeans but no evidence indicates that they lived on the island for long periods of time and would only travel to Newfoundland temporarily. Inuit have been documented on the Great Northern Peninsula as late as the 18th-Century. Newfoundland was historically the southernmost part of the Inuit's territorial range.</p><p>When Europeans arrived from 1497 and later, starting with John Cabot, they established contact with the Beothuk. Estimates of the number of Beothuk on the island at this time vary, ranging from 700 to 5,000.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Later both the English and French settled the island. They were followed by the Mi'kmaq, an Algonquian-speaking indigenous people from eastern Canada and present-day Nova Scotia. As European and Mi'kmaq settlement became year-round and expanded to new areas of the coast, the area available to the Beothuk to harvest the marine resources they relied upon was diminished. By the beginning of the 19th century, few Beothuk remained. Most died due to infectious diseases carried by Europeans, to which they had no immunity, and starvation. Government attempts to engage with the Beothuk and aid them came too late. The Beothuk were exceptionally hostile to foreigners, unlike the Mi'kmaq. The latter readily traded with Europeans and became established in settlements in Newfoundland.</p><h3>European contact, colonisation and settlement[edit]</h3><p>Main article: History of Newfoundland and Labrador</p><p>Newfoundland is the site of the only authenticated Norse (mostly Greenlandic Icelanders) settlement in North America. This archeological site was discovered by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, at L'Anse aux Meadows in 1960. The site has been the subject of multi-year archaeological digs in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>These have revealed that the settlement dated to more than 500 years before John Cabot; it contains the earliest-known European structures in North America. Designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO, it is believed to be the Vinland settlement of explorer Leif Eiriksson. (The Icelandic Skálholt Vinland Map of 1570 refers to the area as Promontorium Winlandiæ and correctly shows it on a 51°N parallel with Bristol, England). The Norse stayed for a relatively short period of time, believed to be between 999 and 1001 AD.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Cabot_tower.jpg/250px-Cabot_tower.jpg" width="250" height="188"><br><p>Cabot Tower located in St John's</p><p>After the departure of the Norse, the island was inhabited by aboriginal populations for nearly 500 years. In 1497, the Italian navigator John Cabot (Zuan/Giovanni Cabotto) became the first European since the Norse settlers to set foot on Newfoundland, working under commission of King Henry VII of England. His landing site is unknown but popularly believed to be Cape Bonavista, along the island's East coast.,[14] Another site claimed is Cape Bauld, at the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula. A document found in the Spanish National Archives, written by a Bristol merchant, reports that Cabot's crew landed 1,800 miles (2,900&nbsp;km) west of Dursey Head, Ireland (latitude 51° 35'N), which would put Cabot within sight of Cape Bauld. This document mentions an island that Cabot sailed past to go ashore on the mainland. This description fits with the Cape Bauld theory, as Belle Isle is not far offshore.[14]</p><p>After Cabot, the first European visitors to Newfoundland were Portuguese, Basque, Spanish, French and English migratory fishermen. In 1501, Portuguese explorers Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel Corte-Real charted part of the coast of Newfoundland in a failed attempt to find the Northwest Passage. Late in the 17th century came Irish fishermen, who named the island Talamh an Éisc, meaning land of the fish, or the fishing grounds in Irish Gaelic. This reflected the abundance of fisheries.</p><p>In 1583, when Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally claimed Newfoundland as a colony of England, he found numerous English, French and Portuguese vessels at St. John's. There was no permanent population. Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, and plans of settlement were postponed.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>On July 5, 1610, John Guy set sail from Bristol, England with 39 other colonists for Cuper's Cove. This, and other early attempts at permanent settlement failed to make a profit for the English investors, but some settlers remained, forming the very earliest modern European population on the island. By 1620, the fishermen of England's West Country dominated the east coast of Newfoundland. French fishermen dominated the island's south coast and Northern Peninsula.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg/250px-Cooks_Karte_von_Neufundland.jpg" width="250" height="244"><br><p>James Cook's 1775 Chart of Newfoundland</p><p>After 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, the French ceded control of south and north shores of the island to the British. They kept only the nearby islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, located in the fish-rich Grand Banks off the south coast. Despite some early settlements by the English, the Crown discouraged permanent, year-round settlement of Newfoundland by migratory fishery workers. Thomas Nash was an Irish Catholic fisherman who permanently settled in Newfoundland despite English rule. He established the fishing town of Branch.[15] He and his cousin Father Patrick Power of Callan, County Kilkenny, spread Catholicism in Newfoundland. This settlement attracted a major migration of Irish Catholic immigrants to Newfoundland in the early eighteenth century.[16]</p><p>By the late 18th century, permanent settlement increased, peaking in the early years of the 19th century.[17]</p><p>The French name for the island is Terre Neuve. The name Newfoundland' is one of the oldest European place names in Canada in continuous geographical and cartographical use, dating from a 1502 letter. It was stated in the following 1628 poem:</p><p>A Skeltonicall continued ryme, in praise of my New-found-Land</p><p>Although in cloaths, company, buildings faire
With England, New-found-land cannot compare:
Did some know what contentment I found there,
Alwayes enough, most times somewhat to spare,
With little paines, lesse toyle, and lesser care,
Exempt from taxings, ill newes, Lawing, feare,
If cleane, and warme, no matter what you weare,
Healthy, and wealthy, if men careful are,
With much-much more, then I will now declare,
(I say) if some wise men knew what this were
(I doe beleeue) they'd live no other where.

It was also different from those other immigrants would build on the North American mainland. As a fish-exporting society, Newfoundland was in contact with many ports and societies around the Atlantic rim. But its geographic location and political distinctiveness isolated it from its closest neighbours, Canada and the United States. Internally, most of its population was spread widely around a rugged coastline in small outport settlements. Many were distant from larger centres of population and isolated for long periods by winter ice or bad weather. These conditions had an effect on the cultures of the immigrants. They generated new ways of thinking and acting. Newfoundland and Labrador developed a wide variety of distinctive customs, beliefs, stories, songs and dialects.</p><p>The First World War had a powerful and lasting effect on the society. From a population of about a quarter of a million, 5,482 men went overseas. Nearly 1,500 were killed and 2,300 wounded. On July 1, 1916, at Beaumont-Hamel, France, 753 men of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment went over the top of a trench. The next morning, only 68 men answered the roll-call. Even now, when the rest of Canada celebrates the founding of the country on July 1, many Newfoundlanders take part in solemn ceremonies of remembrance.</p><p>The Second World War also had a lasting effect on Newfoundland. In particular, the United States assigned forces to the military bases at Argentia, Gander, Stephenville, Goose Bay and St. John's.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg/250px-Joseph_Smallwood_signing_Newfoundland_into_Confederation.jpg" width="250" height="192"><br><p>Joseph Smallwood signing the document bringing Newfoundland into Confederation.</p><p>Newfoundland and Labrador is the youngest province in Canada. Newfoundland was organised as a colony in 1825, was self-governing from 1855–1934, and held dominion status from 1907–1949 (see Dominion of Newfoundland). In late 1948, the population of the colony voted 52.3% to 47.7%[18] in favour of joining Canada as a province. Opposition was concentrated among residents of the capital St. John's, and on the Avalon Peninsula.</p><p>Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949. Union with Canada has done little to reduce Newfoundlanders' self-image as a unique group. In 2003, 72% of residents responding identified first as Newfoundlanders, secondarily as Canadians.[19] Separatist sentiment is low, though, less than 12% in the same 2003 study.</p><p>The referendum campaign of 1948 was bitterly fought, and interests in both Canada and Britain favoured and supported confederation with Canada. Jack Pickersgill, a western Canadian native and politician, worked with the confederation camp during the campaign. The Catholic Church, whose members were a minority on the island, lobbied for continued independence. Canada offered financial incentives, including a baby bonus for each child in a family. The Confederates were led by the charismatic Joseph Smallwood, a former radio broadcaster, who had developed socialist political inclinations while working for a socialist newspaper in New York City. His policies as premier were closer to liberalism than socialism.</p><p>Following confederation, Smallwood led Newfoundland for decades as the elected premier. He was said to have a cult of personality among his many supporters. Some residents featured photographs of Joey in their living rooms in a place of prominence.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Flags of Newfoundland[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign%2C_1870%E2%80%931904.svg/175px-Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign%2C_1870%E2%80%931904.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Newfoundland Blue Ensign, Newfoundland's colonial government flag from 1870 to 1904</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign.png/175px-Newfoundland_Blue_Ensign.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The "updated" Newfoundland Blue Ensign, government ensign from 1904 to 1965</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Red_Ensign.svg/175px-Dominion_of_Newfoundland_Red_Ensign.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Newfoundland Red Ensign, Newfoundland's civil ensign from 1904 to 1965</p><p>The first flag to specifically represent Newfoundland is thought to have been an image of a green fir tree on a pink background that was in use in the early 19th century.[20] The first official flag identifying Newfoundland, flown by vessels in service of the colonial government, was the Newfoundland Blue Ensign, adopted in 1870 and used until 1904, when it was modified slightly. In 1904, the crown of the Blue Ensign was replaced with the Great Seal of Newfoundland (having been given royal approval in 1827) and the British Parliament designated Newfoundland Red and Blue ensigns as official flags specifically for Newfoundland. The Red and Blue ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were used officially from 1904 until 1965, with the Red Ensign being flown as civil ensign by merchant shipping, and the Blue being flown by governmental ships (after the British tradition of having different flags for merchant/naval and government vessel identification).</p><p>On September 26, 1907, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom declared the Colony of Newfoundland, as an independent Dominion within the British Empire,[21] and from that point until 1965, the Newfoundland Red Ensign was used as the civil ensign of the Dominion of Newfoundland with the Blue Ensign, again, reserved for government shipping identification. In 1931 the Newfoundland National Assembly adopted the Union Jack as the official national flag, with the Red and Blue Ensigns retained as ensigns for shipping identification.[22]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/175px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>The Union Flag, official flag of both the Dominion and province of Newfoundland from 1931 to 1980</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Flag_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg/175px-Flag_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg.png" width="175" height="88"><br><p>Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador, legislated as the provincial flag on May 28, 1980</p><p>On March 31, 1949, Newfoundland became a province of Canada but retained the Union Jack in legislature, still designating it as the national flag.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Central America (Spanish: América Central or Centroamérica) is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with the South American continent on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate)[2] and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America—except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama—was governed by the Viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After New Spain achieved independence from Spain in 1821, some of its provinces were annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous states: beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838); followed by El Salvador (1841); then Panama (1903); and finally Belize (1981). Even today, though, people in Central America sometimes still refer to their nations as though they are provinces of a Central American state (e.g. it is still common to write C.A. after the country names, in formal and informal contexts).</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Different definitions[edit]</h2><p>Central America may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Central America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg/220px-1798_Cassini_Map_of_Florida%2C_Louisiana%2C_Cuba%2C_and_Central_America_-_Geographicus_-_MessicoFlorida-cassini-1798.jpg" width="220" height="300"><br><p>Central America, 1798</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG/220px-Tikal_Temple1_2006_08_11.JPG" width="220" height="293"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Tikal, Guatemala.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Tazumal_10.jpg/220px-Tazumal_10.jpg" width="220" height="149"><br><p>Tazumal, El Salvador.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg/220px-CPN_WEST_COURT_01.jpg" width="220" height="155"><br><p>Copan, Honduras.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg/220px-Altun_Ha_Belize.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>Altun Ha, Belize.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg/220px-Stone_spheres_of_Costa_Rica._Museo_Nacional.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Stone spheres of Costa Rica.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg/220px-HuellasdeAcahualinca.jpg" width="220" height="157"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Ancient footprints of Acahualinca, Nicaragua.</p><p>In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some[11] culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.</p><p>Following Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.[citation needed]</p><p>In 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.</p><p>The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.</p><p>From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.[citation needed]</p><p>The Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.[citation needed]</p><p>The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506–1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.[citation needed]</p><p>Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation.

The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America,[7] while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Isthmus of Panama, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.</p><p>Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca.

Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.[15]</p><h2>Biodiversity[edit]</h2><p>See also: Central America bioregion</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg/220px-El_Chorreron%2C_San_Fernando%2C_El_Salvador.jpg" width="220" height="296"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>El Chorreron in El Salvador</p><p>Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.[16] The Pacific Flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.

However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.[16] The table below shows recent statistics:</p><p>Biodiversity in Central America (number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants)</p><p>Over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.[24]</p><p>Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.[25] A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species. So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.[26]</p><h3>Flora[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg/220px-Costa_rica_santa_elena_skywalk.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>One of the hanging bridges of the skywalk at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Monteverde, Costa Rica disappearing into the clouds</p><p>From 2001 to 2010, 5,376 square kilometers (2,076&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers (4,711&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers (1,830&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers (793&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers (3,310&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers (1,180&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.[27]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers (43,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[28] extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between 600–1,800 metres (2,000–5,900&nbsp;ft) elevation,[28] and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above 1,800 metres (5,900&nbsp;ft) are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.</p><p>Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1,000 meters (3,300&nbsp;ft) above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia.[29] The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.</p><p>The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund.[30] These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800–4,000 metres (5,900–13,100&nbsp;ft), on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers (5,100&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.[30]</p><h3>Fauna[edit]</h3><p>See also: List of Central American mammals and List of Central American monkey species</p><p>Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extincition are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America.[29] The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Tectonic_plates_Caribbean.png/220px-Tectonic_plates_Caribbean.png" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Central America and the Caribbean Plate

Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.</p><p>Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some 60–160 kilometers (37–99&nbsp;mi) off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.[31] For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.</p><p>The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.</p><p>Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly 80 kilometers (50&nbsp;mi) to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.[32]</p><p>Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.</p><p>Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>See also: Ethnic groups in Central America and Latin Americans</p><p>The population of Central America is estimated at 42,688,190 as of 2012.[3] With an area of 523,780 square kilometers (202,230&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),[2] it has a population density of 81 per square kilometer (210/sq&nbsp;mi).</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png/220px-Espa%C3%B1ol_centroamericano.png" width="220" height="146"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Linguistic variations of classic Central American Spanish.

				This article is about the British city. For other uses, see Bristol (disambiguation).</p><p>Bristol (/'br?st?l/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) is a city and county[4] in South West England with a population of 454,200[5] in 2017. The district has the 10th largest population in England, while the Bristol metropolitan area is the 12th largest in the United Kingdom. The city borders North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.</p><p>Iron Age hill forts and Roman villas were built near the confluence of the rivers Frome and Avon, and around the beginning of the 11th century the settlement was known as Brycgstow (Old English the place at the bridge). Bristol received a royal charter in 1155 and was historically divided between Gloucestershire and Somerset until 1373, when it became a county of itself. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities after London in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham in the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Bristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the U.K.- the Bristol pound, which is pegged to the Pound sterling. The city has two universities, the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England, and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the Royal West of England Academy, the Arnolfini, Spike Island, Ashton Gate and the Memorial Stadium. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road, rail, sea and air by the M5 and M4 (which connect to the city centre by the Portway and M32), Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway mainline rail stations, and Bristol Airport.</p><p>One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness series of travel guides. The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the EU's European Green Capital Award in 2015.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>The most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge.[6] It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer.[7] Alternative etymologies are supported with the numerous orthographic variations in Medieval documents with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.[8]</p><p>The Old English form Brycgstow is commonly used to derive the meaning place at the bridge.[9] Utilizing another form, Brastuile, Rev. Dr. Shaw derived the name from the Celtic words bras (quick, rapid), or braos (a gap, chasm,) and tuile (a stream). The poet Thomas Chatterton popularised a derivation from Brictricstow linking the town to Brictric, the last king of Wessex. It appears that the form Bricstow prevailed until 1204,[10] and the Bristolian 'L' (the tendency for the local accent to add a letter L to the end of some words) is what eventually changed the name to Bristol.[11]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: History of Bristol and Timeline of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Fifteenth-century pictorial map of Bristol, radiating from the town centre" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png/220px-Robert_Ricart%27s_map_of_Bristol.png" width="220" height="345"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Robert Ricart's map of Bristol, drawn when he became common clerk of the town in 1478.

Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.[16]</p><h3>Middle Ages[edit]</h3><p>Bristol was founded by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint producing silver pennies bearing its name.[17] By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons.[17] Under Norman rule, the town had one of the strongest castles in southern England.[18] Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played a prominent role in funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.[19]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg/220px-Bristol_Harbour_%28St_Stephen%27s_Church%2C_St_Augustine_the_Less_Church%2C_Bristol_Cathedral%29%2C_BRO_Picbox-7-PBA-22%2C_1250x1250.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Black and white etching showing the towers of St Stephen's Church, St Augustine the Less Church and Bristol Cathedral, published c.1850</p><p>The port developed in the 11th century around the confluence of the Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls.[20] By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s.[21] The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373,[22] the first town in England to be given this status.[23][24][25] During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre.[26] By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London.[27] One-third to one-half the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49,[28] which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.[29]</p><h3>15th and 16th centuries[edit]</h3><p>During the 15th century Bristol was the second most important port in the country, trading with Ireland,[30] Iceland[31] and Gascony.[26] It was the starting point for many voyages, including Robert Sturmy's (1457–58) unsuccessful attempt to break the Italian monopoly of Eastern Mediterranean trade.[32] New exploration voyages were launched by Venetian John Cabot, who in 1497 made landfall in North America.[33] A 1499 voyage, led by merchant William Weston of Bristol, was the first expedition commanded by an Englishman to North America.[34] During the first decade of the 16th century Bristol's merchants undertook a series of exploration voyages to North America and even founded a commercial organisation, 'The Company Adventurers to the New Found Land', to assist their endeavours.[35] However, they seem to have lost interest in North America after 1509, having incurred great expenses and made little profit.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>During the 16th century, Bristol merchants concentrated on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies.[36] This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, such as food and guns, to Iberia[37] during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604).[38] Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.[39]</p><br><img alt="A stone built Victorian Gothic building with two square towers and a central arched entrance underneath a circular ornate window.

Bristol also gained city status that year.[42] During the English Civil War in the 1640s the city was occupied by Royalists, who built the Royal Fort House on the site of an earlier Parliamentarian stronghold.[43]</p><h3>17th and 18th centuries[edit]</h3><p>Growth of the city and trade came with the rise of England's American colonies in the 17th century. Bristol's location on the west side of Great Britain gave its ships an advantage in sailing to and from the New World, and the city's merchants made the most of it. The 18th century saw an expansion of England's role in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery to the Americas. Bristol and Liverpool became centres of the Triangular Trade. In the first side of the slavery triangle, manufactured goods were shipped to West Africa and exchanged for Africans; the enslaved captives were transported across the Atlantic to the Americas in the Middle Passage under brutal conditions.[44] In the third side of the triangle, plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice, cotton and a few slaves (sold to the aristocracy as house servants) returned across the Atlantic.[44] Some household slaves were baptised in the hope this would mean their freedom in England. The Somersett Case of 1772 clarified that slavery was illegal in England.[45] At the height of the Bristol slave trade from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried a conservatively estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas.[46] The Seven Stars public house,[47] where abolitionist Thomas Clarkson collected information on the slave trade, is still operating.[48]</p><br><img alt=" An engraving showing at the top a sailing ship and paddle steamer in a harbour, with sheds and a church spire.

Because of Bristol's nautical environment, maritime safety was an important issue in the city. During the 19th century, Samuel Plimsoll, known as the sailor's friend, campaigned to make the seas safer; shocked by overloaded vessels, he successfully fought for a compulsory load line on ships.[50]</p><p>In 1739 John Wesley founded the first Methodist chapel, the New Room, in Bristol.[51] Wesley, along with his brother Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, preached to large congregations in Bristol and the neighbouring village of Kingswood, often in the open air.[52][53]</p><h3>19th century[edit]</h3><p>The city was associated with Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway between Bristol and London Paddington, two pioneering Bristol-built oceangoing steamships (SS&nbsp;Great Britain and SS&nbsp;Great Western), and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The new railway replaced the Kennet and Avon Canal, which had fully opened in 1810 as the main route for the transport of goods between Bristol and London.[54] Competition from Liverpool (beginning around 1760), disruptions of maritime commerce due to war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to Bristol's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of Northern England and the West Midlands. The tidal Avon Gorge, which had secured the port during the Middle Ages, had become a liability. An 1804–09 plan to improve the city's port with a floating harbour designed by William Jessop was a costly error, requiring high harbour fees.[55]</p><p>By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over 300 feet (90&nbsp;m) from reaching the harbour, resulting in falling trade.[56] The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.[57] Some of the traditional industries including copper and brass manufacture went into decline,[58] but the import and processing of tobacco flourished with the expansion of the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills business.[59]</p><p>Supported by new industry and growing commerce, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801), quintupled during the 19th century,[60] resulting in the creation of new suburbs such as Clifton and Cotham. These provide architectural examples from the Georgian to the Regency style, with many fine terraces and villas facing the road, and at right angles to it. In the early 19th century, the romantic medieval gothic style appeared, partially as a reaction against the symmetry of Palladianism, and can be seen in buildings such as the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery,[61] the Royal West of England Academy,[62] and The Victoria Rooms.[63] Riots broke out in 1793[64] and 1831; the first over the renewal of tolls on Bristol Bridge, and the second against the rejection of the second Reform Bill by the House of Lords.[65] The Diocese of Bristol had undergone several boundary changes by 1897 when it was reconstituted into the configuration which has lasted into the 21st century.[66]</p><br><img alt="An old ordnance survey map of Bristol, showing roads, railways, rivers and contours." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Bristol_map_1946.jpg/220px-Bristol_map_1946.jpg" width="220" height="204"><br><p>A 1946 map of Bristol</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>20th century[edit]</h3><p>From a population of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971.[67] Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock.[68] Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s.[69] As air travel grew in the first half of the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories.[70]</p><p>Bristol was heavily damaged by Luftwaffe raids during World War II; about 1,300 people living or working in the city were killed and nearly 100,000 buildings were damaged, at least 3,000 beyond repair.[71][72] The original central market area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed churches and fragments of the castle. A third bomb-damaged church nearby, St Nicholas, has been restored and is a museum housing a 1756 William Hogarth triptych painted for the high altar of St Mary Redcliffe. The museum also has statues of King Edward I (moved from Arno's Court Triumphal Arch) and King Edward III (taken from Lawfords' Gate in the city walls when they were demolished about 1760), and 13th-century statues of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (builder of Bristol Castle)[73] and Geoffrey de Montbray (who built the city's walls) from Bristol's Newgate.[74]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg/220px-Ambrose_Rd%2C_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Ambrose Road, in the Cliftonwood neighbourhood</p><p>The rebuilding of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead shopping area regenerated, and one of the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished.[75] Bristol's road infrastructure changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).[76]</p><p>The 20th century relocation of the docks to Avonmouth Docks and Royal Portbury Dock, 7 miles (11&nbsp;km) downstream from the city centre, has allowed the redevelopment of the old dock area (the Floating Harbour).[77] Although the docks' existence was once in jeopardy (since the area was seen as a derelict industrial site), the inaugural 1996 International Festival of the Sea held in and around the docks affirmed the area as a leisure asset of the city.[78]</p><h2>Government[edit]</h2><br><img alt="A large brick building, built in a shallow curve, with a central porch.

Main article: Politics of Bristol</p><p>Bristol City council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards,[79] with two per ward serving four-year terms. Councillors are elected in thirds, with elections held in three years out of every four-year period. Thus, since wards do not have both councillors up for election at the same time, two-thirds of the wards participate in each election.[80] Although the council was long dominated by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats have grown strong in the city and (as the largest party) took minority control of the council after the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives united to defeat the Liberal Democrat administration; Labour ruled the council as a minority administration, with Helen Holland as council leader.[81]</p><p>In February 2009, the Labour group resigned and the Liberal Democrats took office with a minority administration.[82] In the 4 June 2009 council elections the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the city council.[83] In 2010 they increased their representation to 38 seats, giving them a majority of 6.[84] In 2011 they lost their majority, leading to a hung council. In the 2013 local elections, in which a third of the city's wards were up for election, Labour gained 7&nbsp;seats and the Green party doubled their seats from 2&nbsp;to 4. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats.[85]</p><p>These trends were continued into the next election in May 2014, in which Labour gained three seats to take their total to 31, the Green Party won two more seats, the Conservative party gained one seat, and UKIP won their first-ever seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats lost a further seven seats.[86]</p><p>On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a referendum on the question of a directly elected mayor replacing one elected by the council. There were 41,032 votes in favour of a directly elected mayor and 35,880 votes against, with a 24% turnout. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012, and Independent candidate George Ferguson became Mayor of Bristol.[87]</p><p>The Lord Mayor of Bristol, not to be confused with the Mayor of Bristol, is a figurehead elected each May by the city council. Councillor Faruk Choudhury was selected by his fellow councillors for the position in 2013. At 38, he was the youngest person to serve as Lord Mayor of Bristol and the first Muslim elected to the office.[88]</p><p>Bristol constituencies in the House of Commons also included parts of other local authority areas until the 2010 general election, when their boundaries were aligned with the county boundary. The city is divided into Bristol West, East, South and North West.[89] Since the 2015 election, the city has had three Labour members of parliament (MPs) and one Conservative.[90]</p><p>The city has a tradition of political activism. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that he was a member of parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second.[91][92] Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol,[93] and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83.[94] In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act.[95] The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the social and economic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of fair trade was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.[96]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Bristol is both a city and a county, since Edward III granted it a county charter in 1373.[22] The county was expanded in 1835 to include suburbs such as Clifton, and it was named a county borough in 1889 when that designation was introduced.[24] On 1 April 1974, Bristol became a local government district of the county of Avon.[97] The city regained its independence and county status on 1 April 1996, when Avon was abolished and Bristol became a unitary authority.[98]</p><h2>Geography and environment[edit]</h2><h3>Boundaries[edit]</h3><p>See also: Subdivisions of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Suspension bridge between two brick built towers, over a wooded gorge, showing mud and water at the bottom.

The narrowest definition of the city is the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.[99]</p><p>A slightly broader definition used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol but outside the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary.[100] The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano.[101] The North Fringe of Bristol, a developed area in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named as part of a 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.[102]</p><h3>Greater Bristol[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Greater Bristol</p><p>The term Greater Bristol, used by the Government Office of the South West (now abolished), the Office for National Statistics and others,[103] refers to the city and portions of the three neighbouring local authorities?—?Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire?—?an area sometimes called the former Avon area or the West of England Partnership (WEP) area.

The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.[107]</p><p>The gorge, which helped protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone to build the city, and its surrounding land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.[107]</p><h3>Climate[edit]</h3><p>Located in southern England, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK with a mean annual temperature of approximately 10.5&nbsp;°C (50.9&nbsp;°F).[108][109] It is among the sunniest, with 1,541–1,885&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.[110] Although the city is partially sheltered by the Mendip Hills, it is exposed to the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel. Annual rainfall increases from north to south, with totals north of the Avon in the 600–900&nbsp;mm (24–35&nbsp;in) range and 900–1,200&nbsp;mm (35–47&nbsp;in) south of the river.[111] Rain is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with autumn and winter the wetter seasons. The Atlantic Ocean influences Bristol's weather, keeping its average temperature above freezing throughout the year, but winter frosts are frequent and snow occasionally falls from early November to late April. Summers are warm and drier, with variable sunshine, rain and clouds, and spring weather is unsettled.[112]</p><p>The weather stations nearest Bristol for which long-term climate data are available are Long Ashton (about 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) south west of the city centre) and Bristol Weather Station, in the city centre. Data collection at these locations ended in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and Filton Airfield is currently the nearest weather station to the city.[113] Temperatures at Long Ashton from 1959 to 2002 ranged from 33.5&nbsp;°C (92.3&nbsp;°F) in July 1976[114] to -14.4&nbsp;°C (6.1&nbsp;°F) in January 1982.[115] Monthly high temperatures since 2002 at Filton exceeding those recorded at Long Ashton include 25.7&nbsp;°C (78.3&nbsp;°F) in April 2003,[116] 34.5&nbsp;°C (94.1&nbsp;°F) in July 2006[117] and 26.8&nbsp;°C (80.2&nbsp;°F) in October 2011.[118] The lowest recent temperature at Filton was -10.1&nbsp;°C (13.8&nbsp;°F) in December 2010.[119] Although large cities in general experience an urban heat island effect, with warmer temperatures than their surrounding rural areas, this phenomenon is minimal in Bristol.[120]</p><h3>Environment[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Environment in Bristol</p><p>Bristol was ranked as Britain's most-sustainable city (based on its environmental performance, quality of life, future-proofing and approaches to climate change, recycling and biodiversity), topping environmental charity Forum for the Future's 2008 Sustainable Cities Index.[123][124] Local initiatives include Sustrans (creators of the National Cycle Network, founded as Cyclebag in 1977)[125] and Resourcesaver, a non-profit business established in 1988 by Avon Friends of the Earth.[126] In 2014 The Sunday Times named it as the best city in Britain in which to live.[127] The city received the 2015 European Green Capital Award, becoming the first UK city to receive this award.[128]</p><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Demography of Bristol</p><p>In 2014, the Office for National Statistics estimated the Bristol unitary authority's population at 442,474,[133][134] making it the 43rd-largest ceremonial county in England.[134] The ONS, using Census 2001 data, estimated the city's population at 441,556[135] and that of the contiguous urban area at 551,066.[136] In 2006 the ONS estimated Bristol's urban-area population at 587,400,[137] making it England's sixth-most-populous city and ninth-most-populous urban area.[136] At 3,599 inhabitants per square kilometre (9,321/sq&nbsp;mi) it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district.[138]</p><p>According to the 2011 census, 84% of the population was White (77.9% White British, 0.9% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy or Irish Travellers and 5.1% Other White); 3.6% mixed-race (1.7% white-and-black Caribbean, 0.4% white-and-black African, 0.8% white and Asian and 0.7% other mixed); 5.5% Asian (1.5% Indian, 1.6% Pakistani, 0.5% Bangladeshi, 0.9% Chinese and one percent other Asian); 6% Black (2.8% African, 1.6% Caribbean, 1.6% Other Black), 0.3% Arab and 0.6% with other heritage. Bristol is unusual among major British towns and cities in its larger black than Asian population.[139] These statistics apply to the Bristol Unitary Authority area, excluding areas of the urban area (2006 estimated population 587,400) in South Gloucestershire, Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) and North Somerset—such as Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Filton and Warmley.[67] 56.2% of the 209,995 Bristol Residents who are employed commute to work using either a car, van, motorbike or Taxi.

Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products.[142] Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.[143][144]</p><p>Ships occasionally departed Bristol for Iceland as early as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot.[20] Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities.[20] In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart from the port after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.[145]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>By 1670 the city had 6,000&nbsp;tons of shipping (of which half was imported tobacco), and by the late 17th and early 18th centuries shipping played a significant role in the slave trade.[20] During the 18th century, Bristol was Britain's second-busiest port;[146] business was conducted in the trading area around The Exchange in Corn Street over bronze tables known as Nails. Although the Nails are cited as originating the phrase cash on the nail (immediate payment), the phrase was probably in use before their installation.[147]</p><p>The city's economy also relies on the aerospace, defence, media, information technology, financial services and tourism industries.[148][149] The Ministry of Defence (MoD)'s Procurement Executive, later known as the Defence Procurement Agency and Defence Equipment and Support, moved to its headquarters to Abbey Wood, Filton, in 1995. This organisation, with a staff of 7,000 to 8,000, procures and supports MoD equipment.[150] One of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top-ten cities by international travel publishers Dorling Kindersley in their Eyewitness guides for young adults.[151]</p><p>Bristol is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the Core Cities Group, and is ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, the fourth highest ranked English city.[152] In 2014 Bristol's gross domestic product was £30.502&nbsp;billion.[153][154] Its per capita GDP was £46,000 ($65,106, €57,794), which was some 65% above the national average, the third highest of any English city (after London and Nottingham) and the sixth highest of any city in the United Kingdom (behind London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Nottingham).[153] Bristol's March 2007 unemployment rate was 4.8%, compared with four percent for South West England and the national average of 5.5%.[155]</p><p>Although Bristol's economy no longer relies upon its port, which was moved to docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s[156] and to the Royal Portbury Dock in 1977 as ship size increased, it is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330&nbsp;million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9&nbsp;million long tons (4&nbsp;million tonnes) to 11.8&nbsp;million (12&nbsp;million).[157] Tobacco importing and cigarette manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.[158]</p><p>The financial services sector employs 59,000 in the city,[159] and 50 micro-electronics and silicon design companies employ about 5,000. In 1983 Hewlett-Packard opened its national research laboratory in Bristol.[160][161] In 2014 the city was ranked seventh in the top 10 UK destinations by TripAdvisor.[162]</p><p>During the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at Filton by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later Rolls-Royce) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I Bristol Fighter[163] and World War II Blenheim and Beaufighter planes.[163] During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the Freighter, Britannia and Brabazon. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, luxury Bristol Cars at their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960.[164] The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.[165]</p><br><img alt="A view from below of an aeroplane in flight, with a slender fuselage and swept back wings." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg/220px-Concorde_on_Bristol.jpg" width="220" height="157"><br><p>Final Concorde flight on 26 November 2003, shortly before landing on the Filton runway.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>The climate of the area is tropical to subtropical in Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Rainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents (cool upwellings keep the ABC islands arid). Warm, moist trade winds blow consistently from the east creating rain forest /semi desert divisions on mountainous islands. Occasional north westerlies affect the northern islands in the winter. The region enjoys year-round sunshine, divided into 'dry' and 'wet' seasons, with the latter six months of the year being wetter than the first half.</p><p>Hurricane season is from June to November, but they occur more frequently in August and September and more common in the northern islands of the Caribbean.

The region also contains about 8% (by surface area) of the world's coral reefs[25] along with extensive seagrass meadows,[26] both of which are frequently found in the shallow marine waters bordering the island and continental coasts of the region.</p><p>For the fungi, there is a modern checklist based on nearly 90,000 records derived from specimens in reference collections, published accounts and field observations.[27] That checklist includes more than 11250 species of fungi recorded from the region. As its authors note, the work is far from exhaustive, and it is likely that the true total number of fungal species already known from the Caribbean is higher. The true total number of fungal species occurring in the Caribbean, including species not yet recorded, is likely far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have been discovered.[28] Though the amount of available information is still small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to some Caribbean islands. For Cuba, 2200 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the island;[29] for Puerto Rico, the number is 789 species;[30] for the Dominican Republic, the number is 699 species;[31] for Trinidad and Tobago, the number is 407 species.[32]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Many of the ecosystems of the Caribbean islands have been devastated by deforestation, pollution, and human encroachment. The arrival of the first humans is correlated with extinction of giant owls and dwarf ground sloths.[33] The hotspot contains dozens of highly threatened animals (ranging from birds, to mammals and reptiles), fungi and plants. Examples of threatened animals include the Puerto Rican amazon, two species of solenodon (giant shrews) in Cuba and the Hispaniola island, and the Cuban crocodile.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Isla_Saona.jpg/750px-Isla_Saona.jpg" width="750" height="159"><p>Saona Island, Dominican Republic</p><p>The region's coral reefs, which contain about 70 species of hard corals and between 500–700 species of reef-associated fishes[34] have undergone rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in recent years, and are considered particularly vulnerable to global warming and ocean acidification.[35] According to a UNEP report, the Caribbean coral reefs might get extinct in next 20 years due to population explosion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas and global warming.[36]</p><p>Some Caribbean islands have terrain that Europeans found suitable for cultivation for agriculture. Tobacco was an important early crop during the colonial era, but was eventually overtaken by sugarcane production as the region's staple crop. Sugar was produced from sugarcane for export to Europe. Cuba and Barbados were historically the largest producers of sugar. The tropical plantation system thus came to dominate Caribbean settlement. Other islands were found to have terrain unsuited for agriculture, for example Dominica, which remains heavily forested. The islands in the southern Lesser Antilles, Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, are extremely arid, making them unsuitable for agriculture. However, they have salt pans that were exploited by the Dutch. Sea water was pumped into shallow ponds, producing coarse salt when the water evaporated.[37]</p><p>The natural environmental diversity of the Caribbean islands has led to recent growth in eco-tourism. This type of tourism is growing on islands lacking sandy beaches and dense human populations.[38]</p><h3>Plants and animals[edit]</h3><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Agostino_Brunias_-_Linen_Market%2C_Dominica_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Agostino_Brunias_-_Linen_Market%2C_Dominica_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="159"><br><p>A linen market in Dominica in the 1770s</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Agostino_Brunias._Free_Women_of_Color_with_Their_Children_and_Servants_in_a_Landscape%2C_ca._1770-1796.jpg/220px-Agostino_Brunias._Free_Women_of_Color_with_Their_Children_and_Servants_in_a_Landscape%2C_ca._1770-1796.jpg" width="220" height="173"><br><p>Agostino Brunias.

The population of the Caribbean is estimated to have been around 750,000 immediately before European contact, although lower and higher figures are given. After contact, social disruption and epidemic diseases such as smallpox and measles (to which they had no natural immunity)[39] led to a decline in the Amerindian population.[40] From 1500 to 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from West Africa[41] such as the Kongo, Igbo, Akan, Fon and Yoruba as well as military prisoners from Ireland, who were deported during the Cromwellian reign in England.[citation needed] Immigrants from Britain, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark also arrived, although the mortality rate was high for both groups.[42]</p><p>The population is estimated to have reached 2.2 million by 1800.[43] Immigrants from India, China, Indonesia, and other countries arrived in the mid-19th century as indentured servants.[44] After the ending of the Atlantic slave trade, the population increased naturally.[45] The total regional population was estimated at 37.5 million by 2000.[46]</p><p>The majority of the Caribbean has populations of mainly Africans in the French Caribbean, Anglophone Caribbean and Dutch Caribbean, there are minorities of mixed-race (including Mulatto-Creole, Dougla, Mestizo, Quadroon, Cholo, Castizo, Criollo, Zambo, Pardo, Asian Latin Americans, Chindian, Cocoa panyols, and Eurasian); and European people of Spanish, Dutch, English, French, Italian, and Portuguese ancestry. Asians, especially those of Chinese, Indian descent, and Javenese Indonesians, form a significant minority in the region and also contribute to multiracial communities. Indians form a majority of the population in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Most of their ancestors arrived in the 19th century as indentured laborers.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Spanish-speaking Caribbean have primarily mixed race, African, or European majorities. Puerto Rico has a European majority with a mixture of European-African-Native American (tri-racial), and a large Mulatto (European-West African) and West African minority. One third of Cuba's (largest Caribbean island) population is of African descent, with a sizable Mulatto (mixed African–European) population, and European majority. The Dominican Republic has the largest mixed race population, primarily descended from Europeans, West Africans, and Amerindians.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Revellers_Wine_at_Trinidad_Carnival.jpg/220px-Revellers_Wine_at_Trinidad_Carnival.jpg" width="220" height="293"><br><p>Carnival in Trinidad and Tobago</p><p>Larger islands such as Jamaica, have a very large African majority, in addition to a significant mixed race, and has Chinese, Europeans, Indians, Latinos, Jews, and Arabs populations. This is a result of years of importation of slaves and indentured laborers, and migration. Most multi-racial Jamaicans refer to themselves as either mixed race or brown. Similar populations can be found in the Caricom states of Belize, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago has a multi-racial cosmopolitan society due to the arrivals of Africans, Indians, Chinese, Arabs, Jews, Spanish, Portuguese, and Europeans along with the Native Amerindians population. This multi-racial mix has created sub-ethnicities that often straddle the boundaries of major ethnicities and include Dougla, Chindian, Mulatto-Creole, Afro-Asians, Eurasian, Cocoa panyols, and Asian Latin Americans</p><h3>Indigenous groups[edit]</h3><h3>Language[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Languages of the Caribbean</p><p>Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Haitian Creole, Antillean Creole French, and Papiamento are the predominant official languages of various countries in the region, though a handful of unique creole languages or dialects can also be found from one country to another.

Regional development has contributed to attempts to subdue current problems and avoid projected problems. From a political and economic perspective, regionalism serves to make Caribbean states active participants in current international affairs through collective coalitions. In 1973, the first political regionalism in the Caribbean Basin was created by advances of the English-speaking Caribbean nations through the institution known as the Caribbean Common Market and Community (CARICOM)[49] which is located in Guyana.</p><p>Certain scholars have argued both for and against generalizing the political structures of the Caribbean. On the one hand the Caribbean states are politically diverse, ranging from communist systems such as Cuba toward more capitalist Westminster-style parliamentary systems as in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other scholars argue that these differences are superficial, and that they tend to undermine commonalities in the various Caribbean states. Contemporary Caribbean systems seem to reflect a blending of traditional and modern patterns, yielding hybrid systems that exhibit significant structural variations and divergent constitutional traditions yet ultimately appear to function in similar ways.[50] The political systems of the Caribbean states share similar practices.</p><p>The influence of regionalism in the Caribbean is often marginalized. Some scholars believe that regionalism cannot exist in the Caribbean because each small state is unique. On the other hand, scholars also suggest that there are commonalities amongst the Caribbean nations that suggest regionalism exists. Proximity as well as historical ties among the Caribbean nations has led to cooperation as well as a desire for collective action.[51] These attempts at regionalization reflect the nations' desires to compete in the international economic system.[51]</p><p>Furthermore, a lack of interest from other major states promoted regionalism in the region. In recent years the Caribbean has suffered from a lack of U.S. interest. With the end of the Cold War, U.S. security and economic interests have been focused on other areas. As a result there has been a significant reduction in U.S. aid and investment to the Caribbean.[52] The lack of international support for these small, relatively poor states, helped regionalism prosper.</p><p>Following the Cold War another issue of importance in the Caribbean has been the reduced economic growth of some Caribbean States due to the United States and European Union's allegations of special treatment toward the region by each other. [clarification needed]</p><p>United States effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The United States under President Bill Clinton launched a challenge in the World Trade Organization against the EU over Europe's preferential program, known as the Lomé Convention, which allowed banana exports from the former colonies of the Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) to enter Europe cheaply.[53] The World Trade Organization sided in the United States' favour and the beneficial elements of the convention to African, Caribbean and Pacific states has been partially dismantled and replaced by the Cotonou Agreement.[54]</p><p>During the US/EU dispute, the United States imposed large tariffs on European Union goods (up to 100%) to pressure Europe to change the agreement with the Caribbean nations in favour of the Cotonou Agreement.[55]</p><p>Farmers in the Caribbean have complained of falling profits and rising costs as the Lomé Convention weakens. Some farmers have faced increased pressure to turn towards the cultivation of illegal drugs, which has a higher profit margin and fills the sizable demand for these illegal drugs in North America and Europe.[56][57]</p><p>Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and Association of Caribbean States[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Caribbean nations have also started to more closely cooperate in the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force and other instruments to add oversight of the offshore industry. One of the most important associations that deal with regionalism amongst the nations of the Caribbean Basin has been the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Proposed by CARICOM in 1992, the ACS soon won the support of the other countries of the region. It was founded in July 1994. The ACS maintains regionalism within the Caribbean on issues unique to the Caribbean Basin. Through coalition building, like the ACS and CARICOM, regionalism has become an undeniable part of the politics and economics of the Caribbean. The successes of region-building initiatives are still debated by scholars, yet regionalism remains prevalent throughout the Caribbean.</p><p>Venezuela's effects on regionalism[edit]</p><p>The President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez launched an economic group called the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), which several eastern Caribbean islands joined. In 2012, the nation of Haiti, with 9 million people, became the largest CARICOM nation that sought to join the union.[58]</p><h2>Regional institutions[edit]</h2><p>Here are some of the bodies that several islands share in collaboration:</p><h2>Cuisine[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Caribbean cuisine</p><h3>Favorite or national dishes[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg/220px-FOOD_Doubles_2.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Doubles, one of the national dishes of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Arroz_con_gandules.jpg/220px-Arroz_con_gandules.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Arroz con gandules, one of the national dishes of Puerto Rico.</p><p>Geography:</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Find more aboutCaribbeanat Wikipedia's sister projects</p><p>Coordinates: 14°31'32?N 75°49'06?W? / ?14.52556°N 75.81833°W? / 14.52556; -75.81833</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

The term Amerindian (short for 'Indians of the Americas) is used in Quebec, the Guianas, and the English-speaking Caribbean.[24][25][26][27] In Brazil, indígenas or povos indígenas are common if formal-sounding designations, while índio is still the more often-heard term (the noun for the Indian nationality being indiano), and aborígene and nativo being rarely used in Amerindian-specific contexts (e.g. aborígene is usually understood as the ethnonym for Indigenous Australians). Indigenous peoples are commonly known in Canada as Aboriginal peoples, which includes not only First Nations and Arctic Inuit, but also the minority population of First Nations-European mixed-race Métis people[28] who identify culturally and ethnically with indigenous peoplehood. This is contrasted, for instance, to the American Indian-European mixed-race mestizos of Hispanic America (caboclos in Brazil) who, with their larger population (in most Latin American countries constituting either outright majorities, pluralities, or at the least large minorities), identify largely as a new ethnic group distinct from both Europeans and Indigenous Americans, but still considering themselves a subset of the European-derived Hispanic or Brazilian peoplehood in culture and ethnicity (cf. ladinos).</p><p>Indigenous peoples of the United States are commonly known as Native Americans or American Indians, and Alaska Natives.[29]</p><p>Application of the term Indian originated with Christopher Columbus, who, in his search for Asia, thought that he had arrived in the East Indies.[30][31][32][33][34][35] Eventually, those islands came to be known as the West Indies, a name still used. This led to the blanket term Indies and Indians (Spanish indios, Portuguese índios) for the indigenous inhabitants, which implied some kind of racial or cultural unity among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by the myriad groups of indigenous peoples themselves, but has since been embraced by many over the last two centuries.[citation needed] Even though the term Indian generally does not include the culturally and linguistically distinct indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions of the Americas—such as the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, who entered the continent as a second more recent wave of migration several thousand years ago, and have much more recent genetic and cultural commonalities with the aboriginal peoples of the Asiatic Arctic Russian Far East—these groups are nonetheless considered indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Portuguese and Spanish equivalents to Indian, nevertheless, could be used to mean any hunter-gatherer or full-blooded Indigenous person, particularly to continents other than Europe or Africa—for example, indios filipinos.</p><p>Although some indigenous peoples of the Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas.[36] Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting, and gathering. In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, chiefdoms, states, and empires.</p><p>Many parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Greenland, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guaraní, Mayan languages, and Nahuatl, count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, social organization, and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects, but also cater to modern needs. Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from Western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples.</p><h2>Contents</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>History[edit]</h2><h3>Migration into the continents[edit]</h3><p>For more details on theories of the migrations of the Paleo-Indians, see settlement of the Americas.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg/200px-Glyptodon_old_drawing.jpg" width="200" height="126"><br><p>Illustration of Paleo-Indians hunting a glyptodont</p><p>The specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are the subject of ongoing research and discussion.[37][38] According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.[37] During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the land bridge of Beringia that joined Siberia to northwest North America (Alaska).[39][40] Alaska was a glacial refugium because it had low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of North America, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.[41][42]</p><p>Indigenous genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia.[43][44] The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10–20,000 years.[45][46][47] Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.[38][48][49] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets.[50]</p><p>Another route proposed involves migration – either on foot or using primitive boats – along the Pacific Northwest coast to the south, including as far as South America.[51] Archeological evidence of the latter would have been covered by the sea level rise of more than 120 meters since the last ice age.[52]</p><p>The time range of 40,000–16,500 years ago is debatable and probably will remain so for years to come.[37][38] The few agreements achieved to date include:[53][54]</p><p>Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Archaeologists and anthropologists have studied differences among these crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods.[56] The Clovis culture, the earliest definitively-dated Paleo-Indians in the Americas, appears around 11,500 RCBP (radiocarbon years Before Present[57]), equivalent to 13,500 to 13,000 calendar years ago.</p><p>In 2014, the autosomal DNA was sequenced of a 12,500+-year-old infant from Montana, whose remains were found in close association with several Clovis artifacts.[58] These are the Anzick-1 remains from the Anzick Clovis burial in Montana. The data indicate that the individual was closely related to present North American Native American populations. But, the DNA was ancestral to present-day South American and Central American Native American populations. The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America. Hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas were ruled out.[58] After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Similarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named 'Naia' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called sistema Sac Actun in Mexico's eastern Yucatán Peninsula. DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas. The DNA indicates she was from a lineage derived from Asian origins and also represented in the DNA of the modern native population.[59]</p><p>Pre-Columbian era[edit]

Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first significant European and African arrivals (ca. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through oral history and through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with the contact and colonization period, and were documented in historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Mayan, Olmec, Mixtec, and Nahua peoples, had their own written languages and records. However, the European colonists of the time worked to eliminate non-Christian beliefs, and burned many pre-Columbian written records. Only a few documents remained hidden and survived, leaving contemporary historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations before and at the time of European encounter had achieved great complexity and many accomplishments.[64] For instance, the Aztecs built one of the largest cities in the world, Tenochtitlan, the ancient site of Mexico City, with an estimated population of 200,000. American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics. The domestication of maize or corn required thousands of years of selective breeding, and continued cultivation of multiple varieties was done with planning and selection, generally by women.</p><p>Inuit, Yupik, Aleut, and American Indian creation myths tell of a variety of origins of their respective peoples. Some were always there or were created by gods or animals, some migrated from a specified compass point, and others came from across the ocean.[65]</p><h3>European colonization[edit]</h3><p>Main article: European colonization of the Americas
See also: Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas and Columbian Exchange</p><br><br><p>Cultural areas of North America at time of European contact</p><p>The European colonization of the Americas fundamentally changed the lives and cultures of the native peoples of the continents. Although the exact pre-contact population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Native American populations diminished by between 80 and 90% within the first centuries of contact with Europeans. The leading cause was disease. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as smallpox, measles, and cholera, which the early explorers brought from Europe and which spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them. Native Americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases. Conflicts between colonists and indigenous people exacerbated the loss of lives. Colonists frequently[quantify] perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them.[66][67][68] According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), the North American Indian Wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 Native Americans.[69]</p><p>The first indigenous group encountered by Columbus, the 250,000 Taínos of Hispaniola, represented the dominant culture in the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Within thirty years about 70% of the Taínos had died.[70] They had no immunity to European diseases, so outbreaks of measles and smallpox ravaged their population.[71] Increasing punishment of the Taínos for revolting against forced labour, despite measures put in place by the encomienda, which included religious education and protection from warring tribes,[72] eventually led to the last great Taíno rebellion (1511–1529).</p><p>Following years of mistreatment, the Taínos began to adopt suicidal behaviors, with women aborting or killing their infants and men jumping from cliffs or ingesting untreated cassava, a violent poison.[70] Eventually, a Taíno Cacique named Enriquillo managed to hold out in the Baoruco Mountain Range for thirteen years, causing serious damage to the Spanish, Carib-held plantations and their Indian auxiliaries.[73][not in citation given] Hearing of the seriousness of the revolt, Emperor Charles V (also King of Spain) sent captain Francisco Barrionuevo to negotiate a peace treaty with the ever-increasing number of rebels. Two months later, after consultation with the Audencia of Santo Domingo, Enriquillo was offered any part of the island to live in peace.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in America, particularly with regard to native Indians. The laws forbade the maltreatment of natives and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.[74] The Spanish crown found it difficult to enforce these laws in distant colonies.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/FlorentineCodex_BK12_F54_smallpox.jpg/220px-FlorentineCodex_BK12_F54_smallpox.jpg" width="220" height="170"><br><p>Drawing accompanying text in Book XII of the 16th-century Florentine Codex (compiled 1540–1585), showing Nahuas of conquest-era central Mexico suffering from smallpox</p><p>Various theories for the decline of the Native American populations emphasize epidemic diseases, conflicts with Europeans, and conflicts among warring tribes. Scholars[which?] now[when?] believe that, among the various contributing factors, epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives.[75][76] Some[quantify] believe that after first contacts with Europeans and Africans, Old World diseases caused the deaths of 90 to 95% of the native population of the New World in the following 150 years.[77] Smallpox killed up to one third of the native population of Hispaniola in 1518.[78] By killing the Incan ruler Huayna Capac, smallpox caused the Inca Civil War of 1529–1532. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Typhus (probably) in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, measles in 1618—all ravaged the remains of Inca culture.</p><p>Smallpox killed millions of native inhabitants of Mexico.[79][80] Unintentionally introduced at Veracruz with the arrival of Pánfilo de Narváez on April 23, 1520, smallpox ravaged Mexico in the 1520s,[81] possibly killing over 150,000 in Tenochtitlán (the heartland of the Aztec Empire) alone, and aiding in the victory of Hernán Cortés over the Aztec Empire at Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City) in 1521.[citation needed]</p><p>Over the centuries the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous Americans had no immunity.[82]</p><p>Exploration of the Caribbean led to the discovery of the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles. Their culture was destroyed by 1650. Only 500 had survived by the year 1550, though the bloodlines continued through to the modern populace. In Amazonia, indigenous societies weathered centuries of colonization.[83]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/%C3%8Dndios_em_uma_fazenda.jpg/220px-%C3%8Dndios_em_uma_fazenda.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>Indians visiting a Brazilian farm plantation in Minas Gerais ca. 1824</p><p>Contact with European diseases such as smallpox and measles killed between 50 and 67 per cent of the aboriginal population of North America in the first hundred years after the arrival of Europeans.[84] Some 90 per cent of the native population near Massachusetts Bay Colony died of smallpox in an epidemic in 1617–1619.[85] In 1633, in Fort Orange (New Netherland), the Native Americans there were exposed to smallpox because of contact with Europeans. As it had done elsewhere, the virus wiped out entire population-groups of Native Americans.[86] It reached Lake Ontario in 1636, and the lands of the Iroquois by 1679.[87][88] During the 1770s smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.[89] The 1775–82 North American smallpox epidemic and the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic brought devastation and drastic population depletion among the Plains Indians.[90][91] In 1832 the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans (The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832).[92][93]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The indigenous peoples in Brazil declined from a pre-Columbian high of an estimated three million[94] to some 300,000 in 1997.[dubious – discuss][not in citation given][95]</p><p>The Spanish Empire and other Europeans re-introduced horses to the Americas. Some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild.[96] The re-introduction of the horse, extinct in the Americas for over 7500 years, had a profound impact on Native American culture in the Great Plains of North America and in Patagonia in South America. By domesticating horses, some tribes had great success: horses enabled them to expand their territories, exchange more goods with neighboring tribes, and more easily capture game, especially bison.</p><h2>Agriculture[edit]</h2><p>See also: Agriculture in Mesoamerica and Incan agriculture</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Buffalo_Hunt.jpg/220px-Buffalo_Hunt.jpg" width="220" height="153"><br><p>A bison hunt depicted by George Catlin</p><p>Over time and thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.[97] In certain cases, the indigenous peoples developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, as was the case in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild teosinte grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.</p><p>The South American highlands were a center of early agriculture. Genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern Peru,[98] from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex. Over 99% of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south-central Chile,[99] Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum, where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago.[100][101] According to George Raudzens, It is clear that in pre-Columbian times some groups struggled to survive and often suffered food shortages and famines, while others enjoyed a varied and substantial diet.[102] The persistent drought around 850 AD coincided with the collapse of Classic Maya civilization, and the famine of One Rabbit (AD 1454) was a major catastrophe in Mexico.[103]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg/220px-Pisac_Terrassen_medium.jpg" width="220" height="148"><br><p>Andenes in the Sacred Valley of the Incas, Peru. The Incan agricultural terraces are still used by many of the Incas' descendents, Quechua-speaking Andean farmers.</p><p>Natives of North America began practicing farming approximately 4,000 years ago, late in the Archaic period of North American cultures. Technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.[104]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the Mississippi River valley, Europeans noted Native Americans' managed groves of nut and fruit trees not far from villages and towns and their gardens and agricultural fields. Further away, prescribed burning would have been used in forest and prairie areas.[105]</p><p>Many crops first domesticated by indigenous Americans are now produced and used globally. Chief among these is maize or corn, arguably the most important crop in the world.[106] Other significant crops include cassava, chia, squash (pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, acorn squash, butternut squash), the pinto bean, Phaseolus beans including most common beans, tepary beans and lima beans, tomatoes, potatoes, avocados, peanuts, cocoa beans (used to make chocolate), vanilla, strawberries, pineapples, Peppers (species and varieties of Capsicum, including bell peppers, jalapeños, paprika and chili peppers) sunflower seeds, rubber, brazilwood, chicle, tobacco, coca, manioc and some species of cotton.</p><p>Studies of contemporary indigenous environmental management, including agro-forestry practices among Itza Maya in Guatemala and hunting and fishing among the Menominee of Wisconsin, suggest that longstanding sacred values may represent a summary of sustainable millennial traditions.[107]</p><h2>Culture[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Quechuawomanandchild.jpg/220px-Quechuawomanandchild.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Andes, Peru</p><p>Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations. An example of such a cultural area is Mesoamerica, where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.</p><h3>Languages[edit]</h3><p>The languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area. Of equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the Chippewas and Delawares.[108]</p><h3>Writing systems[edit]</h3><p>See also: Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, Cherokee syllabary, and Quipu</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg/220px-Palenque_glyphs-edit1.jpg" width="220" height="153"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Maya glyphs in stucco at the Museo de sitio in Palenque, Mexico</p><p>The development of writing is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block. The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane.[109]</p><p>The Maya writing system was a combination of phonetic syllabic symbols and logograms—that is, it was a logosyllabic writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different glyphs, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.[110][111][112]</p><p>The Zapotec writing system is one of the earliest writing systems in the Americas.[113] The oldest example of the Zapotec script is a monument discovered in San José Mogote, dating from around from 600 BCE.[114] Zapotec writing was logographic and presumably syllabic.[113] The remains of the Zapotec writing system are present in the monumental architecture. There are only a few extant inscriptions, which makes study of this writing system difficult.</p><p>Aztec codices (singular codex) are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era Aztecs. These codices provide some of the best primary sources for Aztec culture. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.[115] The colonial era codices not only contain Aztec pictograms, but also Classical Nahuatl (in the Latin alphabet), Spanish, and occasionally Latin.</p><p>Spanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there is a large number of local-level documents in Nahuatl, Zapotec, Mixtec, and Yucatec Maya from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.[116] The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the New Philology to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.[117]</p><p>The Wiigwaasabak, birch bark scrolls on which the Ojibwa (Anishinaabe) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics.</p><p>Aboriginal syllabic writing, or simply syllabics, is a family of abugidas used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the Algonquian, Inuit, and Athabaskan language families.</p><h3>Music and art[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas and Native American music</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg/220px-Apache_violin%2C_made_by_Chesley_Wilson%2C_1989_-_National_Museum_of_American_History_-_DSC00053.jpg" width="220" height="367"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Apache fiddle made by Chesley Goseyun Wilson (San Carlos Apache)</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Gorget%2C_Peru%2C_north_coast%2C_Chimu_style%2C_c._1350-1450_AD%2C_feathers%2C_reeds%2C_copper_bars%2C_silver%2C_metal_overlaid_with_skin_-_Textile_Museum%2C_George_Washington_University_-_DSC09898.JPG/220px-thumbnail.jpg" width="220" height="121"><br><p>Chimu culture feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350–1450 CE</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/JuPi_1.jpg/220px-JuPi_1.jpg" width="220" height="313"><br><p>Textile art by Julia Pingushat (Inuk, Arviat, Nunavut Territory, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995</p><p>Native American music in North America is almost entirely monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and rasps were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends on the length of the wood used and the hand span of the intended player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.[citation needed]</p><p>The music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America was often pentatonic. Before the arrival of the Spaniards and other Europeans, music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and wind instruments such as drums, flutes, sea snail shells (used as a trumpet) and rain tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600–900 CE), which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced.

Contributions include pottery, paintings, jewellery, weavings, sculptures, basketry, carvings, and beadwork.[119] Because too many artists were posing as Native Americans and Alaska Natives[120] in order to profit from the cachet of Indigenous art in the United States, the U.S. passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, requiring artists to prove that they are enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe. To support the ongoing practice of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian arts and cultures in the United States,[121] the Ford Foundation, arts advocates and American Indian tribes created an endowment seed fund and established a national Native Arts and Cultures Foundation in 2007.[122][123]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Demography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png/220px-Percentage_of_Amerindian_Population.png" width="220" height="234"><br><p>This map shows the percentage of indigenous population in different countries of the Americas.</p><p>The following table provides estimates for each country in the Americas of the populations of indigenous people and those with partial indigenous ancestry, each expressed as a percentage of the overall population.

Minor but important peoples are the Quechua (6,739), the Charrúa (4,511), the Pilagá (4,465), the Chané (4,376), and the Chorote (2,613). The Selknam (Ona) people are now virtually extinct in its pure form. The languages of the Diaguita, Tehuelche, and Selknam nations have become extinct or virtually extinct: the Cacán language (spoken by Diaguitas) in the 18th century and the Selknam language in the 20th century; one Tehuelche language (Southern Tehuelche) is still spoken by a handful of elderly people.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Belize[edit]</h3><p>Mestizos (mixed European-Indigenous) number about 34% of the population; unmixed Maya make up another 10.6% (Ketchi, Mopan, and Yucatec).

Some 3.7% report growing up with an indigenous mother tongue but do not identify as indigenous.[150] When both of these categories are totaled, and children under 15, some 66.4% of Bolivia's population was recorded as indigenous in the 2001 Census.[151]</p><p>The largest indigenous ethnic groups are: Quechua, about 2.5 million people; Aymara, 2.0 million; Chiquitano, 181,000; Guaraní, 126,000; and Mojeño, 69,000. Some 124,000 belong to smaller indigenous groups.[152] The Constitution of Bolivia, enacted in 2009, recognizes 36 cultures, each with its own language, as part of a pluri-national state. Some groups, including CONAMAQ (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu), draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of 50 indigenous peoples native to Bolivia.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Pongo_0436b.jpg/160px-Pongo_0436b.jpg" width="160" height="240"><br><p>Indigenous woman in traditional dress, near Cochabamba, Bolivia</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of empowered caciques to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953.[153] While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged people identifying as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s.[154] Many lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official title to indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted grassroots territorial organizations; these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas.</p><p>Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages. The constitutional reform in 1997 recognized Bolivia as a multi-lingual, pluri-ethnic society and introduced education reform. In 2005, for the first time in the country's history, an indigenous Aymara, Evo Morales, was elected as President.</p><p>Morales began work on his indigenous autonomy policy, which he launched in the eastern lowlands department on August 3, 2009. Bolivia was the first nation in the history of South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to self-government.[155] Speaking in Santa Cruz Department, the President called it a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement, saying that, though he might make errors, he would never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people.[155] A vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in December 2009, at the same time as general elections to office. The issue divided the country.[156]</p><p>At that time, indigenous peoples voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy: five departments that had not already done so voted for it;[157][158] as did Gran Chaco Province in Taríja, for regional autonomy;[159] and 11 of 12 municipalities that had referendums on this issue.[157]</p><h3>Brazil[edit]</h3><p>See also: Indigenous peoples in Brazil and List of indigenous peoples in Brazil</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Terena005.jpg/200px-Terena005.jpg" width="200" height="291"><br><p>Brazilian indigenous man of Terena tribe</p><p>Indigenous peoples of Brazil make up 0.4% of Brazil's population, or about 817,000 people, but millions of Brazilians are mestizo or have some indigenous ancestry.[160] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although in the 21st century, the majority of them live in indigenous territories in the North and Center-Western part of the country. On January 18, 2007, Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005.

Eskimo is considered derogatory in many other places because it was given by non-Inuit people and was said to mean eater of raw meat.[165] Hundreds of Aboriginal nations evolved trade, spiritual and social hierarchies. The Métis ethnicity developed a culture, especially in the area of the Red River of the North, from the mid-17th century after generations of First Nations and native Inuit married European settlers. They were small farmers, hunters and trappers, and usually Catholic and French-speaking.[166] The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period.[167] Various laws, treaties, and legislation have been enacted between European-Canadians and First Nations across Canada. Aboriginal Right to Self-Government provides the opportunity for First Nations to manage their own historical, cultural, political, health care and economic control within their communities.</p><br><img alt="Colour photograph of Tsuu T'ina children in traditional costume on horseback at a Stampede Parade in front of an audience" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Tsuu_Tsina_parade.JPG/220px-Tsuu_Tsina_parade.JPG" width="220" height="133"><br><p>Tsuu T'ina children at a parade</p><p>Although not without conflict, European/Canadian early interactions in the east with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful compared to the later experience of native peoples in the United States.[168] Combined with a late economic development in many regions,[169] this relatively peaceful history resulted in Indigenous peoples having a fairly strong influence on the early national culture, while preserving their own identity.[170] From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into the mainstream European-influenced culture, which they referred to as Canadian culture.[171] The government attempted forced integration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[172] National Aboriginal Day recognises the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples of Canada.[173] There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands encompassing 1,172,790 2006 people spread across Canada, with distinctive Aboriginal cultures, languages, art, and music.[174][175][176]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Chile[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Indigenous peoples in Chile</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Hombre_%26_mujer_Mapuche.jpg/220px-Hombre_%26_mujer_Mapuche.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Mapuche man and woman.

The Mapuche successfully fought off defeat in the first 300–350 years of Spanish rule during the Arauco War. Relations with the new Chilean Republic were good until the Chilean state decided to occupy their lands. During the Occupation of Araucanía the Mapuche surrendered to the country's army in the 1880s.

Many are from the Taíno people or Arawak people. When the Spanish Empire was in control of the island they used the Natives as slaves and many died from diseases, hence decreasing the population. Presently 0.3 of the population of Cuba consists of part Native and full-blooded Amerindians.</p><h3>Dominica[edit]</h3><p>Dominica is home to the Carib Territory, one of the last indigenous communities in the Caribbean.

The Pipil lived in western El Salvador, spoke Nawat, and had many settlements there, most noticeably Cuzcatlan. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and fertile land that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other lands like Guatemala or Mexico, but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by Pedro de Alvarado along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people.

Mestizos, which in Mexico designate people who do not identify culturally with any indigenous grouping, quickly came to account for a majority of the colony's population; but 6% of the Mexican population identify as speakers of one of the indigenous languages. The CDI identifies 62 indigenous groups in Mexico, each with a unique language.[181]</p><p>In the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca and in the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula the majority of the population is indigenous. <br>

				This article is about the continent. For the politico-economic union, see European Union. For other uses, see Europe (disambiguation).</p><p>Europe —a concept dating back to classical antiquity— is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The eastern boundary with Asia is an arbitrary historical and social construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. The primarily physiographic term continent as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities and lines of demarcation are not reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries with Asia. Europe is considered by historical convention as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.[5]</p><p>Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which the Russian Federation is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 740&nbsp;million (about 11% of world population) as of 2015[update].[6] The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.</p><p>Europe, in particular ancient Greece, was the birthplace of Western civilization.[7][8][9] The fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the migration period, marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. From the Age of Discovery onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the majority of Asia.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Both world wars took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence.[10] During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
