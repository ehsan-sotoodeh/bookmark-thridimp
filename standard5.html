	<div class="content"><p>Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner project during the 1960s. The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight.[166] In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).[167]</p><p>The aerospace industry remains a major sector of the local economy.[168] Major aerospace companies in Bristol include BAE Systems, a merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and BAe (the latter a merger of BAC, Hawker Siddeley and Scottish Aviation). Airbus[169] and Rolls-Royce are also based at Filton, and aerospace engineering is an area of research at the University of the West of England. Another aviation company in the city is Cameron Balloons, who manufacture hot air balloons;[170] each August the city hosts the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, one of Europe's largest hot-air balloon festivals.[171]</p><p>In 2005 Bristol was named by the UK government one of England's six science cities.[172][173] A £500&nbsp;million shopping centre, Cabot Circus, opened in 2008 amidst predictions by developers and politicians that the city would become one of England's top ten retail destinations.[174] The Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries around Bristol Temple Meads railway station,[175] was announced in 2011[176] and launched the following year.[175] The 70-hectare (170-acre) Urban Enterprise Zone has streamlined planning procedures and reduced business rates. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other designated enterprise areas in the region:[177] Avonmouth, Bath, Bristol and Bath Science Park in Emersons Green, Filton, and Weston-super-Mare. Bristol is the only big city whose wealth per capita is higher than that of Britain as a whole. With a highly skilled workforce drawn from its universities, Bristol claims to have the largest cluster of computer chip designers and manufacturers outside Silicon Valley. The wider region has one of the biggest aerospace hubs in the UK, centred on Airbus, Rolls-Royce and GKN at Filton airfield.[178]</p><br><img alt="A panoramic view looking over a cityscape of office blocks, old buildings, church spires and a multi-story car park.

Some of the modern venues and modern digital production companies have merged with legacy production companies based in old buildings around the city. In 2008 the city was a finalist for the 2008 European Capital of Culture, although the title was awarded to Liverpool.[179]</p><p>The Bristol Old Vic, founded in 1946 as an offshoot of The Old Vic in London, occupies the 1766 Theatre Royal (607 seats) on King Street; the 150-seat New Vic (a studio-type theatre), and a foyer and bar in the adjacent Coopers' Hall (built in 1743). The Theatre Royal, a grade I listed building,[180][181] is the oldest continuously operating theatre in England.[182] The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (which originated in King Street) is a separate company, and the Bristol Hippodrome is a 1,951-seat theatre for national touring productions. Other smaller theatres include the Tobacco Factory, QEH, the Redgrave Theatre at Clifton College and the Alma Tavern. Bristol's theatre scene features several companies as well as the Old Vic, including Show of Strength, Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory and Travelling Light. Theatre Bristol is a partnership between the city council, Arts Council England and local residents to develop the city's theatre industry.[183] Several organisations support Bristol theatre; the Residence (an artist-led community) provides office, social and rehearsal space for theatre and performance companies,[184] and Equity has a branch in the city.[185]</p><p>The city has many venues for live music, its largest the 2,000-seat Colston Hall named after Edward Colston. Others include the Bristol Academy, The Fleece, The Croft, the Exchange, Fiddlers, the Victoria Rooms, Trinity Centre, St George's Bristol and several pubs, from the jazz-oriented The Old Duke to rock at the Fleece and indie bands at the Louisiana.[186][187] In 2010 PRS for Music called Bristol the UK's most musical city, based on the number of its members born there relative to the city's population.[188] Since the late 1970s Bristol has been home to bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, and trip hop and Bristol Sound artists such as Tricky,[189] Portishead[190] and Massive Attack;[191] the list of bands from Bristol is extensive. The city is a stronghold of drum and bass, with artists such as Roni Size's Mercury Prize-winning Reprazent,[192] as DJ Krust[193] and More Rockers.[194] This music is part of the Bristol urban-culture scene which received international media attention during the 1990s.[195]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery houses a collection encompassing natural history, archaeology, local glassware, Chinese ceramics and art. The M Shed museum opened in 2011 on the site of the former Bristol Industrial Museum.[196] Both are operated by Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, which also runs three historic houses?—?the Tudor Red Lodge, the Georgian House and Blaise Castle House?—?and Bristol Archives.[197] The 18th- and 19th-century portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, 19th-century architect Francis Greenway (designer of many of Sydney's first buildings) were born in the city. The graffiti artist Banksy is believed to be from Bristol, and many of his works are on display in the city.[198]</p><p>The Watershed Media Centre and Arnolfini gallery (both in dockside warehouses) exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema, and the city's oldest gallery is at the Royal West of England Academy in Clifton.[199] The nomadic Antlers Gallery opened in 2010, moving into empty spaces on Park Street, on Whiteladies Road and in the Purifier House on Bristol's Harbourside.[200] Stop motion animation films and commercials (produced by Aardman Animations) are made in Bristol.[201] Bristol is home to the regional headquarters of BBC West and the BBC Natural History Unit.[202] Locations in and around Bristol have featured in the BBC's natural-history programmes, including Animal Magic (filmed at Bristol Zoo).[203]</p><p>Bristol is the birthplace of 18th-century poets Robert Southey[204] and Thomas Chatterton.[205] Southey (born on Wine Street in 1774) and his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, married the Fricker sisters from the city.[206] William Wordsworth spent time in Bristol,[207] where Joseph Cottle published Lyrical Ballads in 1798. Actor Cary Grant was born in Bristol and comedians from the city include Justin Lee Collins,[208] Lee Evans,[209] Lloyd Langford,[210][211] Russell Howard[212] and writer-comedian Stephen Merchant.[213]</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Buildings and architecture of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Large, square two-storey house at the end of a dirt path" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Kings_Weston_House%2C_Bristol._The_Garden_Front._Sir_John_Vanbrugh%2C_1712.jpg/220px-Kings_Weston_House%2C_Bristol._The_Garden_Front._Sir_John_Vanbrugh%2C_1712.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Garden front of John Vanbrugh's Kings Weston House, Bristol</p><br><img alt="A seventeenth-century timber-framed building with three gables and a traditional inn sign showing a picture of a sailing barge.

During the mid-19th century Bristol Byzantine, a style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen in the city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period,[215] and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.[216]</p><p>The oldest Grade I listed buildings in Bristol are religious. St James' Priory was founded in 1129 as a Benedictine priory by Earl Robert of Gloucester, the illegitimate son of Henry I.[217] The second oldest is Bristol Cathedral and its associated Great Gatehouse.[218] Founded in 1140, the church became the seat of the bishop and cathedral of the new Diocese of Bristol in 1542. Most of the medieval stonework, particularly the Elder Lady Chapel, is made from limestone taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas.[219] Amongst the other churches included in the list is the 12th century St Mary Redcliffe which is the tallest building in Bristol. The church was described by Queen Elizabeth I as the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.[220]</p><p>Secular buildings include The Red Lodge, built in 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge for a larger house that once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in Georgian times and restored in the early 20th century.[221] St Bartholomew's Hospital is a 12th-century town house which was incorporated into a monastery hospital founded in 1240 by Sir John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr (c.?1277–1347), and became Bristol Grammar School from 1532 to 1767, and then Queen Elizabeth's Hospital 1767–1847. The round piers predate the hospital, and may come from an aisled hall, the earliest remains of domestic architecture in the city, which was then adapted to form the hospital chapel.[222] Three 17th-century town houses which were attached to the hospital were incorporated into model workers' flats in 1865, and converted to offices in 1978. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652[223] to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow[224] on King Street and the Hatchet Inn.[225]</p><p>Manor houses include Goldney Hall, where the highly decorated Grotto dates from 1739.[226] Commercial buildings such as the Exchange[227] and Old Post Office[228] from the 1740s are also included in the list. Residential buildings include the Georgian Portland Square[229] and the complex of small cottages around a green at Blaise Hamlet, which was built around 1811 for retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House.[230] The 18th-century Kings Weston House, in northern Bristol, was designed by John Vanbrugh and is the only Vanbrugh building in any UK city outside London. Almshouses[231] and pubs from the same period[232] intermingle with modern development. Several Georgian squares were designed for the middle class as prosperity increased during the 18th century.[233] During World War II, the city centre was heavily bombed during the Bristol Blitz.[234] The central shopping area near Wine Street and Castle Street was particularly hard-hit, and the Dutch House and St Peter's Hospital were destroyed. Nevertheless, in 1961 John Betjeman called Bristol the most beautiful, interesting and distinguished city in England.[235]</p><h3>Sport[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Sport in Bristol</p><p>Bristol has teams representing all the major national sports. Bristol City and Bristol Rovers are the city's main football clubs. Bristol Rugby (Rugby Union) and Gloucestershire County Cricket Club are also based in the city.</p><p>The two Football League clubs are Bristol City and Bristol Rovers?—?the former being the only club from the city to play in the precursor to the Premier League. Non-league clubs include Mangotsfield United, Bristol Manor Farm and Brislington. Bristol City, formed in 1897, were Division One runners-up in 1907 and lost the FA Cup final in 1909. In the First Division in 1976, they then sank to the bottom professional tier before reforming after a 1982 bankruptcy. Bristol City were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007, losing to Hull City in the playoff for promotion to the Premier League that season.[236]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="In the foreground twentieth century housing can be seen amidst trees and on the right a tower block of flats.

They were third-tier champions twice (Division Three South in 1952–53 and Division Three in 1989–90), Watney Cup Winners (1972) and runners-up for the Johnstone's Paint Trophy (2006–07) although have never played in England's top Division. The club has planning permission for a new 21,700-capacity all-seater stadium at the University of the West of England's Frenchay campus. Construction was due to begin in mid-2014, but in March 2015 the sale of the Memorial Stadium site (needed to finance the new stadium) was in jeopardy.[237][238] Bristol Academy Women's Football Club is based at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.[239]</p><p>The city is also home to Bristol Rugby,[240] formed in 1888 as Bristol Football Club by the merger of the Carlton club with rival Redland Park. Westbury Park declined the merger and folded, with many of its players joining Bristol.[241] Bristol Rugby has often competed at the highest level of the sport since its formation in 1888.[242] The club played at the Memorial Ground, which it shared with Bristol Rovers from 1996. Although Bristol Rugby owned the stadium when the football club arrived, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes led to a transfer of ownership to Bristol Rovers. In 2014 Bristol Rugby moved to their new home, Ashton Gate Stadium (home to Bristol Rovers' rivals Bristol City), for the 2014–15 season.[243][244] Dating from 1901, the Bristol Combination and its 53 clubs promote rugby union in the city and help support Bristol Rugby.[245] The most prominent of Bristol's smaller rugby clubs include Clifton Rugby, Dings Crusaders, and Cleve. Rugby league is represented in Bristol by the Bristol Sonics.[246]</p><p>The first-class cricket club Gloucestershire County Cricket Club[247] has its headquarters and plays the majority of its home games at the Bristol County Ground, the only major international sports venue in the south west of England. It was formed by the family of W. G. Grace.[248] The club is arguably Bristol's most successful, achieving a period of success between 1999 and 2006 when it won nine trophies and became the most formidable one-day outfit in England, including winning a double double in 1999 and 2000 (both the Benson and Hedges Cup and the C&amp;G Trophy), and the Sunday League in 2000. Gloucestershire CCC also won the Royal London One-Day Cup in 2015.</p><p>The Bristol Flyers basketball team have competed in the British Basketball League, the UK's premier professional basketball league, since 2014.[249] Bristol Aztecs play in Britain's premier American football competition, the BAFA National Leagues.[250] In 2009 ice hockey returned to Bristol after a 17-year absence, with the Bristol Pitbulls playing at Bristol Ice Rink; after its closure, it shared a venue with Oxford City Stars.[251] Bristol sponsors an annual half marathon and hosted the 2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.[252] Athletic clubs in Bristol include Bristol and West AC, Bitton Road Runners and Westbury Harriers. Bristol has staged finishes and starts of the Tour of Britain cycle race[253] and facilities in the city were used as training camps for the 2012 London Olympics.[254] The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, a major UK hot-air ballooning event, is held each summer at Ashton Court.[255]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="A large number of hot air balloons taking off from a field which is surrounded by tents and stalls.

These include nature documentaries, including The Blue Planet and Planet Earth. The city has a long association with David Attenborough's authored documentaries, including Life on Earth.[256]</p><p>Bristol has two daily newspapers, the Western Daily Press and the Bristol Post; a weekly free newspaper, the Bristol Observer; and a Bristol edition of the free Metro newspaper. All are owned by the Trinity Mirror Group. The Bristol Mercury was published from 1716 and 1909.[257]</p><p>The city has several radio stations, including BBC Radio Bristol. Bristol's television productions include Points West for BBC West, Endemol productions such as Deal or No Deal, The Crystal Maze, and ITV News West Country for ITV West &amp; Wales (formerly HTV West) and ITV Westcountry. The hospital drama Casualty, formerly filmed in Bristol, moved to Cardiff in 2012.[258]</p><p>Publishers in the city have included 18th-century Bristolian Joseph Cottle, who helped introduce Romanticism by publishing the works of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.[259] During the 19th century, J.W. Arrowsmith published the Victorian comedies Three Men in a Boat (by Jerome K. Jerome) and The Diary of a Nobody by George and Weedon Grossmith.[260] The contemporary Redcliffe Press has published over 200 books covering all aspects of th<br>

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The coat of arms of Greenland is a blue shield featuring a silver polar bear. This symbol was first introduced in the coat of arms of Denmark in 1666[1] and it is still represented in the arms of the Danish royal family. In a Danish context, the bear was originally shown walking naturally, but an upright position was specified in 1819. The 1470 London Roll shows an arms captioned Le Roy de Greneland featuring a shield depicting a polar bear surrounded by three birds. This royal title did not reflect any official title, but merely that the arms could be used by anyone controlling Greenland.[2]</p><p>The version currently used by the government of Greenland was designed by Greenlandic artist Jens Rosing and adopted on May 1, 1989 by the Landsting. The polar bear symbolizes the fauna of Greenland and the blue (azure) colour designates the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean Greenland is washed by. Instead of the Danish version in the royal arms which follows the heraldic tradition in raising the right forepaw, the polar bear on the Greenlandic coat of arms raises the left forepaw, due to the traditional Inuit belief that polar bears are left-handed.[3] A similar arms is used by the official Danish government representative in Greenland. In this case, the bear raises its right paw, and the shield is crowned with the royal crown.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official Danish specification of the arms does not specify which forepaw is raised, so there is no conflict between the different versions.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Nuuk (Greenlandic pronunciation:&nbsp;[nu?k]; Danish: Godthåb)[2] is the capital and largest city of Greenland and the municipality of Sermersooq. It is the seat of government and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains almost a third of Greenland's population, and also has the tallest building in Greenland. Nuuk is the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2016, it had a population of 17,316,[3] making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population.</p><p>Nuuk is the Kalaallisut word for cape. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°10' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, located only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. Since 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the new Sermersooq municipality,[4] linking the town centre with the outlying districts and neighborhoods[5] of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa.[6] In 2012 the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk. The campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland, and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland[7] is located at the northern end of the district, near the road to the Nuuk Airport.[8]</p><p>Nuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[9][10]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq.[11] For a long time it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Viking explorers in the 10th century (Western Settlement), and shortly thereafter by Inuit peoples.[12] Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the Norse settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Egede_nuuk.JPG/200px-Egede_nuuk.JPG" width="200" height="134"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The statue of Hans Egede in Nuuk.</p><p>The city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony (Haabets Koloni) from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Danish colony under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[13] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[14] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[15] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940 when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[16]</p><p>In 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (Danish: Nye-Hernhut). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864),[17] before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.[18]</p><p>Around 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and perceived the Greenlanders had lost much of their culture and identity under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the Atuagagdliutt, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became significant for the Greenlandic identity.</p><p>During World War II, there was a reawakening to Greenlandic national identity. Greenlanders shared a written language and assembled a council under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. Under new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernise Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[19]</p><p>An article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[20] suggested worldwide,</p><p>One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland’s population of 58,000 is Inuit, and least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[20]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>See also: Nuup Kangerlua</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Godthaabsfjord.jpg/200px-Godthaabsfjord.jpg" width="200" height="134"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Nuukair.jpg/200px-Nuukair.jpg" width="200" height="133"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Left: Satellite view.

Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at 64°43'N 50°37'W? / ?64.717°N 50.617°W? / 64.717; -50.617, splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua.[23] The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately 64°03'N 51°58'W? / ?64.050°N 51.967°W? / 64.050; -51.967. Some 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) to the northeast, reaching a height of 1,210&nbsp;m (3,970&nbsp;ft), Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper Sermitsiaq. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, 790&nbsp;m (2,590&nbsp;ft), and Lille Malene, 420&nbsp;m (1,380&nbsp;ft).[24] The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.[25][26]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>Nuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen ET) with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. On 22 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 and sets at 14:20. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 03:00 and does not set until 00:00. Nuuk can get mild temperatures on brief occasions year round, with each month having recorded 13&nbsp;°C (55&nbsp;°F) or warmer. The monthly averages range from -7.5&nbsp;°C (18.5&nbsp;°F) to 8&nbsp;°C (46&nbsp;°F), whereas all-time extremes range from -32.5&nbsp;°C (-26.5&nbsp;°F) to 26.3&nbsp;°C (79.3&nbsp;°F).</p><p>The climate (6.5&nbsp;°C (43.7&nbsp;°F) in July) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees (10&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees[30] which do not sustain well.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>With 16,992 inhabitants as of 2015[update], Nuuk is by far the largest and fastest growing town in Greenland. Despite an overall decline in the country's population, there was an increase of 174 from 2014 to 2015.[31] Nuuk, Paamiut[citation needed] and Tasiilaq are the only towns in the Sermersooq commune (a third of Greenland) which have grown steadily over the last two decades. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, 3,636 were born outside the country.[32] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[33] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[24]</p><h2>Government and politics[edit]</h2><p>As the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative centre of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[24]</p><p>As of December 2015, the mayor of Nuuk is Asii Chemnitz Narup. She is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[34]</p><p>Greenland's Self Government Parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms.[35] All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women's Party.[36]</p><h3>KANUKOKA[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: KANUKOKA</p><p>KANUKOKA (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaanni Kommunit Kattuffiat) is based in Nuuk.

It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbour but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[40] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US $7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[24] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.</p><p>The city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[41]</p><h3>Energy[edit]</h3><p>All of Greenland's electricity is powered by the government owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[42] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[43][44]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg/220px-Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg" width="220" height="88"><br><p>University of Greenland</p><p>Nuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning.

"Ethnicities" redirects here. It is not to be confused with the academic journal.</p><p>An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral, language, social, cultural or national experiences.[1][2] Ethnicity is often an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. In some cases, it can be adopted if a person moves into another society[citation needed]. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, and physical appearance.</p><p>Ethnic groups, derived from the same historical founder population, often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to leave one ethnic group and become part of another (except for ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity as a key membership criterion).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Ethnicity is often used synonymously with ambiguous terms such as nation or people. In English, it can also have the connotation of something exotic (cf. White ethnic, ethnic restaurant, etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the founding population of an area was established.</p><p>The largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals (Han Chinese being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as tribes or clans, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity, and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Nileshwar_22.jpg/220px-Nileshwar_22.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Ethnic saris in Kerala</p><p>The term ethnic is derived from the Greek word ????? ethnos (more precisely, from the adjective ??????? ethnikos,[3] which was loaned into Latin as ethnicus). The inherited English language term for this concept is folk, used alongside the latinate people since the late Middle English period.</p><p>In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, ethnic was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate nations which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used ta ethne (the nations) to translate the Hebrew goyim the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews.[4] The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a host of men, a band of comrades as well as a swarm or flock of animals. In Classical Greek, the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by ethnic group, mostly translated as nation, people; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to foreign or barbarous nations in particular (whence the later meaning heathen, pagan).[5]</p><p>In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of peculiar to a race, people or nation, in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of different cultural groups, and in American English racial, cultural or national minority group arises in the 1930s to 1940s,[6] serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. The abstract ethnicity had been used for paganism in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an ethnic character (first recorded 1953). The term ethnic group was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.[7] Depending on the context that is used, the term nationality may either be used synonymously with ethnicity, or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950.</p><p>Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In many cases – for instance, the sense of Jewish peoplehood&nbsp;– more than one aspect determines membership.</p><h2>Definitions and conceptual history[edit]</h2><p>Ethnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus in ca. 480 BC laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own ethnicity, which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating</p><li>shared descent (?µa?µ?? - homaimon, of the same blood),[8]</li><li>shared language (?µ????ss?? - homoglosson, speaking the same language)[9]</li><li>shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: ?e?? ?d??µat? te ????? ?a? ??s?a? - theon hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)[10]</li><li>shared customs (Greek: ??ea ?µ?t??pa - ethea homotropa, customs of like fashion).[11][12][13]</li><p>Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. According to Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality, in Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics and Reality&nbsp;: Proceedings of the Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, April 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, Department of Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993,[14] a conference organised by Statistics Canada and the United States Census Bureau (April 1–3, 1992).[15] Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16][irrelevant citation]</p><p>According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.</p><p>According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.[25]</p><p>Max Weber maintained that ethnic groups were künstlich (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called race.[26]</p><p>Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose Ethnic Groups and Boundaries from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s.[27] Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical a prioris to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: ...&nbsp;categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.</p><p>In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of ethnic groups in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>...&nbsp;the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed.[27]</p><p>In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as cultural or tribal when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that ethnicity had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning ethnic identity (like earlier claims concerning tribal identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.[27]</p><p>According to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:</p><p>[C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.[28]</p><p>Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.[29] Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness.[27] He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) Ethnicity&nbsp;... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.[27] This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.</p><h3>Approaches to understanding ethnicity[edit]</h3><p>Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. Examples of such approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.</p><p>Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16] Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.[36]</p><p>Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to boundary markers - characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.[37][38][39][40][41]</p><h3>Ethnicity theory[edit]</h3><p>Ethnicity theory says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification.[42] This theory was put forth by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of “culture”.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This theory was preceded by over a century where biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation of scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used was the measurement of cranial capacity.[43]</p><p>Ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture.</p><p>Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country.[44] While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process&nbsp;– contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation&nbsp;– it did so only for white ethnic communities.[44] The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact.</p><p>And assimilation&nbsp;– shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture&nbsp;– did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others.[44] Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities.[45] It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.[46] In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a “benign neglect” of social inequality.[46]</p><h2>Ethnicity and nationality[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Nation state and minority group</p><p>In some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner[47] and Benedict Anderson[48] see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of nation-states in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries. Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.</p><p>In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent nations. Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state.[49] Under these conditions&nbsp;– when people moved from one state to another,[50] or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries&nbsp;– ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Multi-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation state. Examples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, which were ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed multicultural societies especially in large cities.</p><p>The states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.</p><p>In recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis)[51] have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent.[52] It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviours that belong to a specific collectivity.[53] Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne.</p><h2>Ethnicity and race[edit]</h2><p>Race and ethnicity are considered to be related concepts. Ethnicity is often assumed to be somewhat more of a cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language and cultural tradition, while race is assumed to be strictly a biological classification, based on DNA and bone structure. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to its common political use. It is assumed that, based on power relations, there exist 'racialized ethnicities' and 'ethnicized races'. Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.[54]</p><p>Before Weber, race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity was predominant: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.[55] With Weber's introduction of the view of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.</p><p>In 1950, the UNESCO statement, The Race Question, signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), suggested that: National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'.[56]</p><p>In 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:</p><p>The opposing interests that divide the working classes are further reinforced through appeals to racial and ethnic distinctions. Such appeals serve to allocate different categories of workers to rungs on the scale of labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations to the lower levels and insulating the higher echelons from competition from below. Capitalism did not create all the distinctions of ethnicity and race that function to set off categories of workers from one another. It is, nevertheless, the process of labor mobilization under capitalism that imparts to these distinctions their effective values.[57]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.[58]</p><p>Writing about the usage of the term ethnic in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, in 1977 Wallman noted that</p><p>The term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' in Britain, only less precisely, and with a lighter value load. In North America, by contrast, '[race]' most commonly means color, and 'ethnics' are the descendants of relatively recent immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. '[Ethnic]' is not a noun in Britain. In effect there are no 'ethnics'; there are only 'ethnic relations'.[59]</p><p>In the U.S., the OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not scientific or anthropological and takes into account social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry, using appropriate scientific methodologies that are not primarily biological or genetic in reference.[60]</p><h2>Ethno-national conflict[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Ethnic conflict</p><p>Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like Jürgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.</p><p>The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.</p><h2>Ethnic groups by continent[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Africa</p><p>Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture.</p><p>Many ethnic groups and nations of Africa qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society. These mostly originate with the Sahelian kingdoms of the medieval period, such as that of the Akan, deriving from Bonoman (11th century) then the Kingdom of Ashanti (17th century).[61]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Asia</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Assyriankhigga.jpg/230px-Assyriankhigga.jpg" width="230" height="153"><br><p>The Assyrians are the indigenous peoples of Northern Iraq.</p><p>There is an abundance of ethnic groups throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical.

Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban. Some groups/countries of Asia are completely urban (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore). The colonization of Asia was largely ended in the 20th century, with national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.</p><h3>Europe[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Olentzero%2C_Beasain.jpg/220px-Olentzero%2C_Beasain.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>The Basque people constitute an indigenous ethnic minority in both France and Spain.</p><p>Europe has a large number of ethnic groups; Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct peoples of Europe, of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities within every state they inhabit (although they may form local regional majorities within a sub-national entity).

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The term Danish Realm (Danish: Det Danske Rige[14][15]) refers to the relationship between Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland—three countries constituting the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>The legal nature of the Kingdom of Denmark is fundamentally one of a unitary sovereign state. The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been part of the Crown of Denmark since 1397 (de jure) when the Kalmar Union was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (de facto). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an extensive type of self-government and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields.[16]</p><p>Legal matters in The Danish Realm are subject to the Danish Constitution.[17] Beginning in 1953, state law issues within The Danish Realm has been governed by The Unity of the Realm (Danish: Rigsenheden).[18][19][20][21] A less formal name for The Unity of the Realm is the Commonwealth of the Realm.[13] In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as rigsfællesskabet. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both The Unity of The Realm and The Danish Realm itself has increasingly been referred to as simply rigsfællesskabet (Faroese: ríkisfelagsskapurin; Greenlandic: naalagaaffeqatigiit) in daily parlance.[18]</p><p>The Danish Constitution stipulates that the foreign and security interests for all parts of the Danish Realm are the responsibility of the Danish government. The Faroes received home rule in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received self rule, thus leaving the Danish government with virtually no influence over Greenlandic internal affairs.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Constitutionality[edit]</h2><p>The Danish Realm's unique state of internal affairs is acted out in the principle of The Unity of the Realm.[19] This principle is derived from Article 1 of the Danish Constitution which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.[22] The Constitutional Act specifies that sovereignty is to continue to be exclusively with the authorities of the Realm (the Danish government and parliament). Faroese or Greenlandic self-governance cannot be established by international treaties but must be established by Danish law; the Danish parliament (the Folketing) delegates a precisely defined part of its competence to the home rule authorities.[23]</p><p>The language of Denmark is Danish, and the Danish state authorities are based in Denmark. The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, Copenhagen. Two of the parliament's members are elected in each of Greenland and the Faroe Islands; the remaining 175 members are elected in Denmark. The Government ministries are located in Copenhagen, as is the highest court, the Supreme Court.[22]</p><h2>Devolved powers[edit]</h2><p>See also: Home rule, Politics of the Faroe Islands, and Politics of Greenland</p><p>In principle, the Danish Realm constitutes a unified sovereign state, with equal status between its constituent parts.[13] Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains de jure unitary.</p><p>The Self-Government Arrangements devolves political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and the Greenlandic political authorities. The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks. The Danish government provides an annual grant to the Faroese and the Greenlandic authorities to cover the costs of these devolved areas.[16]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Tinganes.jpg/220px-Tinganes.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Tinganes, in the capital Tórshavn, is the location of the Faroese Home Government.</p><p>The 1948 Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands sets out the terms of Faroese home rule. The Act states, ...the Faroe Islands shall constitute a self-governing community within the State of Denmark.[1] It establishes the home government of the Faroe Islands (Landsstýrið) and the Faroese parliament, the Løgting. More significantly, the Act specifies the powers devolved from the Government of Denmark, including: local government and municipal affairs; taxation, at a local and territorial level; public services, including police and town planning; welfare services, such as housing; primary and secondary education; Archives, libraries, museums; agriculture and fishing; entertainment; among other areas.[1] The Faroe Islands were previously administered as a Danish county (amt); the Home Rule Act abolished the post of Amtmand (County Governor) and replaced it with the role of Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner to the Danish government).[1] These powers were expanded in a 2005 Act, which named the Faroese home government as an equal partner with the Danish government.[24]</p><p>The 1978 Greenland Home Rule Act devolves powers in much the same way as the Faroese Home Rule Act. It sets out a home rule government and Greenlandic parliament. Specific areas of governance specified in the act include: Organization of local government; Fishing and agriculture; Welfare system; protection of the environment; other areas affecting Greenlanders directly, etc.[2]</p><p>On 21 June 2009, Greenland assumed self-determination with responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, natural resources, immigration and border controls. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[25] Greenland is now described as having self rule, with its home government exercising a wider range of powers.</p><p>There are a number of matters that can not be acquired by the territories; Constitutional affairs, foreign policy, defence, the Supreme Court, citizenship, and monetary policy. Additionally, the Faroese and Greenlandic parliaments are subordinate to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Denmark, where the two territories are represented by two seats each (from a total of 179 seats).</p><h2>Legal status[edit]</h2><p>The Faroe Islands and Greenland have two seats each (out of 179) in the Danish parliament, Folketinget[26] The arrangement between the areas of the Realm is sometimes described as constituent countries. Greenland's powers of self-government were increased in 2009 through the Greenland Self-Rule Act, which established the Greenlanders as a separate national people under international law, while the Faroe Islands have gradually taken control of more and more areas according to their Home Rule Act from 1948.[27] The Faroese/Danish act of 2005 states This law is based on an agreement between the Governments of the Faroe Islands and Denmark as equal partners.[28] Despite this principle of unity among the three territories, some commentators consider the Danish Realm as a federation or a sui generis legal construction. In the opinion of Bogi Eliasen, the Kingdom of Denmark is not a unitary state but a structure with some federative elements of divided power.[13] Danish justice Frederik Harhoff states that the Kingdom of Denmark is neither a federation (since it lacks a treaty to this effect), nor is it a confederation[13] But the home rules are limited to internal matters only. Greenland or the Faroe Islands cannot write laws which concern the relationship with other states, nor laws that applies to the entire Realm, and the Supreme Court (Danish: Højesteret) in Copenhagen is the final legal instance (and legal matters from Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be prepared for that court, like any Danish matter). Danish currency is also legal tender and Denmark is responsible for the military defense.[29] Further, for rare treatments and certain surgery, Greenlanders and Faraoses are often directed to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>International community[edit]</h3><p>See also: Foreign relations of Denmark</p><p>Previously, most foreign relations were undertaken by the Government of Denmark exclusively on behalf of the entire realm, but more recently the Faroe Islands and Greenland have increased their role in the foreign policy. Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the Thule Air Base in northwest Greenland.</p><p>The Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the OECD and the World Trade Organization. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the Nordic Council in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the European Union, both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but opted to leave in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.</p><p>The Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a national of Denmark and a resident of the Faroe Islands.[1] The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular Danish passport as well. The Faroese Home Rule Act states that, in Faroese passports, Føroyingur (Faroese) and Føroyar (Faroe Islands) shall be inserted after the words Dansk (Danish) and Danmark (Denmark).[1]</p><h2>Population and area[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Geography of Denmark, Geography of Greenland, and Geography of the Faroe Islands</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg/300px-Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg.png" width="300" height="213"><br><p>Comparison map: Greenland, the Faroe Islands (enlarged) and Denmark differ significantly in size. The Danish Realm is spread far apart, across the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea.</p><p>The size of the Danish population is far greater than the population size of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper has a population of about 5.6 million people, while the populations of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are 48,000 and 56,000 people, respectively. A medium-sized Danish provincial town has, for comparison, a population of about 50,000. With an area of over two million km² (836,109 square miles), Greenland is the most sparsely populated territory in the world.</p><p>The disparity between the small population of the former colonies and the greater population of Denmark proper has helped to enforce the hegemonial position that Denmark proper holds in the Realm. When the areas of the three territories are combined, the Kingdom of Denmark ranks as the twelfth largest country in the world, the same rank held by Greenland alone.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><p>Hjemmestyre
Meaning "home rule", it indicates an autonomous administration (present in both in Greenland and the Faroe Islands) that has power over all internal affairs. In this arrangement, the Danish government deals only with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with "self-governing."


Selvstyre
Following a referendum on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.[32] As a result of these changes Greenland was now said to have self rule with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to "home rule".


Rigsombudsmand
High Commissioners represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each country. He or she can attend the meetings at the Løgting in the Faroes and at the Inatsisartut in Greenland, but they can't vote.


Folketingsmedlemmer fra Færøerne og Grønland
Members of Folketing from the Faroe Islands and Greenland: Greenland and the Faroe Islands and their self-rule administrations take part in consultations on policies and decisions affecting their region, including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the Danish parliament (Folketing).

Mirroring the terminology of the United Kingdom or the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Greenland, Denmark and the Faroes are sometimes referred to as countries within the sovereign state of the Kingdom of Denmark. However, such usage is inconsistent; whilst Denmark proper may be referred to as a country, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are officially referred to as "self-governing territories".[33] Additionally, the recent law granting Greenland "self rule" in 2008 refers to Greenland as "a people", but not a country.[34]</p><h2>Literature[edit]</h2><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><h2>Sources[edit]</h2><p>Find more aboutKingdom of Denmarkat Wikipedia's sister projects

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>A constitutional monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution.[1] Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.</p><p>A constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution, whether written or unwritten.[2] While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarch's name, in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets public policy or chooses political leaders. Political scientist Vernon Bogdanor, paraphrasing Thomas Macaulay, has defined a constitutional monarch as a sovereign who reigns but does not rule.[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In addition to acting as a visible symbol of national unity, a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as dissolving parliament or giving royal assent to legislation. However, the exercise of such powers is largely strictly in accordance with either written constitutional principles or unwritten constitutional conventions, rather than any personal political preference imposed by the sovereign. In The English Constitution, British political theorist Walter Bagehot identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch may freely exercise: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. Many constitutional monarchies still retain significant authorities or political influence however, such as through certain reserve powers, and may also play an important political role.</p><p>The United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms are all constitutional monarchies in the Westminster tradition of constitutional governance. Three states&nbsp;– Malaysia, Cambodia and the Holy See&nbsp;– are elective monarchies, wherein the ruler is periodically selected by a small electoral college.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The oldest constitutional monarchy dating back to ancient times was that of the Hittites. They were an ancient Anatolian people that lived during the Bronze Age whose king or queen had to share their authority with an assembly, called Panku, equivalent to a modern-day deliberative assembly of a legislature. These were scattered noble families that worked as representatives of their subjects in an adjutant or subaltern federal-type landscape.[4][5]</p><p>The most recent[update] country to move from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy was Bhutan, between 2007 and 2008 (see Politics of Bhutan, Constitution of Bhutan and Bhutanese democracy).</p><h2>Constitutional and absolute monarchy[edit]</h2><h3>England and the United Kingdom[edit]</h3><p>In the Kingdom of England, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, although limits on the power of the monarch ('a limited monarchy') are much older than that (see Magna Carta). At the same time, in Scotland the Convention of Estates enacted the Claim of Right Act 1689, which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy.</p><p>Although Queen Anne was the last monarch to veto an Act of Parliament when in 1707 she blocked the Scottish Militia Bill, Hanoverian monarchs continued to selectively dictate government policies. For instance George III constantly blocked Catholic Emancipation, eventually precipitating the resignation of William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister in 1801.[6] The sovereign's influence on the choice of Prime Minister gradually declined over this period, William IV being the last monarch to dismiss a Prime Minister, when in 1834 he removed Lord Melbourne as a result of Melbourne's choice of Lord John Russell as Leader of the House of Commons.[7][8] Queen Victoria was the last monarch to exercise real personal power but this diminished over the course of her reign. In 1839 she became the last sovereign to keep a Prime Minister in power against the will of Parliament when the Bedchamber crisis resulted in the retention of Lord Melbourne's administration.[9] By the end of her reign, however, she could do nothing to block the unacceptable (to her) premierships of William Gladstone, although she still exercised power in appointments to the Cabinet, for example in 1886 preventing Gladstone's choice of Hugh Childers as War Secretary in favor of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.[10]</p><p>Today, the role of the British monarch is by convention effectively ceremonial.[11] Instead, the British Parliament and the Government – chiefly in the office of Prime Minister – exercise their powers under 'Royal (or Crown) Prerogative': on behalf of the monarch and through powers still formally possessed by the Monarch.[12][13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>No person may accept significant public office without swearing an oath of allegiance to the Queen.[14] With few exceptions, the monarch is bound by constitutional convention to act on the advice of the Government.</p><h3>Continental Europe[edit]</h3><p>Constitutional monarchy originated in continental Europe, with Poland developing the first constitution for a monarchy with the Constitution of May 3, 1791; it was the third constitution in the world just after the first republican Constitution of the United States. Constitutional monarchy also occurred briefly in the early years of the French Revolution, but much more widely afterwards. Napoleon Bonaparte is considered the first monarch proclaiming himself as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, in his work Elements of the Philosophy of Right (1820), gave the concept a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law.[15] Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan.[16]</p><h2>Modern constitutional monarchy[edit]</h2><p>As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was head of the executive branch and quite a powerful figure even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have envisioned the president as an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was then understood, following Montesquieu's account of the separation of powers.[17]</p><p>The present-day concept of a constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the prime minister, exercise power, with the monarchs having ceded power and remaining as a titular position. In many cases the monarchs, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of servants of the people to reflect the new, egalitarian position. In the course of France's July Monarchy, Louis-Philippe I was styled King of the French rather than King of France.</p><p>Following the Unification of Germany, Otto von Bismarck rejected the British model. In the constitutional monarchy established under the Constitution of the German Empire which Bismarck inspired, the Kaiser retained considerable actual executive power, while the Imperial Chancellor needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Later, Fascist Italy could also be considered as a constitutional monarchy, in that there was a king as the titular head of state while actual power was held by Benito Mussolini under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.</p><p>Nowadays a parliamentary democracy that is a constitutional monarchy is considered to differ from one that is a republic only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected Members of Parliament.</p><p>However, three important factors distinguish monarchies such as the United Kingdom from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with Parliament. These are: the Royal Prerogative under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited circumstances; Sovereign Immunity under which the monarch may do no wrong under the law because the responsible government is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use restrictions as most citizens. Other privileges may be nominal or ceremonial (e.g., where the executive, judiciary, police or armed forces act on the authority of or owe allegiance to the Crown).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today slightly more than a quarter of constitutional monarchies are Western European countries, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Luxembourg, Monaco, Liechtenstein and Sweden. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In these countries the prime minister holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the monarch retains residual (but not always insignificant) powers. The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a coalition government following a parliamentary election, while in Norway the King chairs special meetings of the cabinet.</p><p>In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the Cabinet. Only a few monarchies (most notably Japan and Sweden) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.</p><p>There are sixteen constitutional monarchies under Queen Elizabeth II, which are known as Commonwealth realms.[18] Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant reserve or prerogative powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises, usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor-General exercising such power occurred during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills. On November 11, 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he sought the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition Malcolm Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether Australia should become a republic. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy, however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by the constitution, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.</p><p>In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The former King, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was the longest reigning monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history, prior to passing away on 13 October 2016.[19] Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in Thai Politics.) Among the powers retained by the monarch under the constitution, lèse majesté protects the image of the monarch and enables him to play a role in politics. It carries strict criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence arises from this reverence and from the socio-economic improvement efforts undertaken by the royal family.</p><p>In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a frequent debate centers on when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favor of a partisan goal, while some political scientists champion the idea of an interventionist monarch as a check against possible illegal action by politicians. For instance, the monarch of the United Kingdom can theoretically exercise an absolute veto over legislation by withholding royal assent. However, no monarch has done so since 1708, and it is widely believed that this and many of the monarch's other political powers are lapsed powers.</p><p>There are currently 44 monarchies, and most of them are constitutional monarchies.</p><h2>List of current constitutional monarchies[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

One of the animals found here is the polar bear, which is on the coat of arms of the Danish royal family in Greenland</p><p>The history of Greenland is a history of life under extreme Arctic conditions: currently, an ice cap covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.</p><p>The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental North America. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when Icelandic Vikings settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the Inuit Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around 1200 AD, from northwestern Greenland. While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the Little Ice Age, the early Norse settlements along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, Denmark-Norway, apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a colonial power, Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to paganism. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.</p><p>During World War II, when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the United States and Canada.[1] After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas amt (county). Although Greenland is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it has enjoyed home rule since 1979. In 1985, the island decided to leave the European Union, which it had joined as a part of Denmark in 1973; the Faroes had never joined.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early Paleo-Eskimo cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png/200px-Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png" width="200" height="764"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Arctic cultures in and around Greenland, 900-1500</p><p>The prehistory of Greenland is a story of repeated waves of Paleo-Eskimo immigration from the islands north of the North American mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of Siberia who migrated into Canada thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. Archaeology can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.</p><p>The earliest known cultures in Greenland are the Saqqaq culture (2500–800 BC) [2] and the Independence I culture in northern Greenland (2400–1300 BCE). The practitioners of these two cultures are thought to have descended from separate groups that came to Greenland from northern Canada.[3] Around 800 BCE, the so-called Independence II culture arose in the region where the Independence I culture had previously existed.[4] it was originally thought that Independence II was succeeded by Dorset culture (700 BC–200 AD), but some Independence II artefacts date from as recently as the 1st century BCE. Recent studies suggest that, in Greenland at least, the Dorset culture may be better understood as a continuation of Independence II culture; the two cultures have therefore been designated Greenlandic Dorset. Artefacts associated with early Dorset culture in Greenland have been found as far north as Inglefield Land on the west coast and the Dove Bugt area on the east coast.[5]</p><p>After the Early Dorset culture disappeared around 200 AD, the island was uninhabited for several centuries.[5] The next immigrants to arrive from Canada, perhaps as early as 800, settled the northwest part of the island, bringing with them the so-called Late Dorset culture, which survived until about 1300.[6] The Norse arrived and settled in the southern part of the island in 980.</p><h2>Norse settlement[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg/220px-I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg" width="220" height="138"><br><p>Summer in the Greenland coast circa year 1000
Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen (1841–1893)</p><p>Europeans became aware of Greenland's existence, probably in the early 10th century, when Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, sailing from Norway to Iceland, was blown off course by a storm, and happened to sight some islands off Greenland. During the 980s, explorers led by Erik the Red set out from Iceland and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and settled there. Erik named the island Greenland (Grœnland in Old Norse, Grænland in modern Icelandic, Grønland in modern Danish and Norwegian) in effect as a marketing device. Both the Book of Icelanders (Íslendingabók, a medieval account of Icelandic history from the 12th century onward) and the Saga of Eric the Red (Eiríks saga rauða, a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland) state He named the land Greenland, saying that people would be eager to go there if it had a good name.[7]</p><p>The Norse established their settlements along fjords (such as the Tunuliarfik and Aniaaq fjords in the central area of the Eastern settlement). Because this was during the so-called Medieval Warm Period, the vegetation there was very different from what it is today. Excavations have shown that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4 to 6 metre tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush.[8][unreliable source?][9][unreliable source?] The Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for three years for committing murder.[10] He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.[11] This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at Brattahlid (now Qassiarsuk), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, Leif Eirikson, left the settlement to explore the regions around Vinland, which is generally assumed to have been located in what is now Newfoundland.</p><p>The Norse settled in three separate locations: the larger Eastern settlement, the smaller Western settlement, and the still smaller Middle Settlement (often considered part of the Eastern one). The settlements at their height are estimated to have had a population of between 2,000 and 10,000 people, with more recent estimates[12] tending toward the lower figure. Ruins of approximately 620 farms have been identified: 500 in the Eastern settlement, 95 in the Western settlement, and 20 in the Middle. The settlements carried on a trade in ivory from walrus tusks with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides according to one 13th-century account. They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal Labrador), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late 13th century, all ships from Greenland were required by law to sail directly to Norway. The climate also became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the Little Ice Age.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Hvalsey_Church.jpg/200px-Hvalsey_Church.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Hvalsey Church</p><p>In 1126, a diocese was founded at Garðar (now Igaliku). It was subject to the Norwegian archdiocese of Nidaros (now Trondheim); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261, the population accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King as well, although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements declined in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350. In 1378, there was no longer a bishop at Garðar. The last written record of the Norse Greenlanders is of a marriage, in 1408, in Hvalsey Church, which still stands today; although in ruins, it is the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.</p><p>After 1408 not many written records mention the settlers. There is correspondence between the Pope and the Biskop Bertold af Garde from the same year.[13] The Danish Cartographer Claudius Clavus seems to have visited Greenland in 1420, according to documents written by Nicolas Germanus and Henricus Martellus who had access to original cartographic notes and a map by Clavus.

Among the factors that have been suggested as contributing to the demise of the Greenland colony are:[16][17]</p><p>Numerous studies have tested these hypotheses and some have led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.[citation needed] The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.[18]</p><p>Greenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation.[19] A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food.[19] But they never learned to use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.[19]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>To investigate the possibility of climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples. The oxygen isotopes from the ice caps suggested that the Medieval Warm Period had caused a relatively milder climate in Greenland, lasting from roughly 800 to 1200. However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, the Little Ice Age had reached intense levels in Greenland.[20] Excavations of middens from the Viking farms in both Greenland and Iceland show the shift from the bones of cows and pigs to those of sheep and goats. As the winters lengthened, and the springs and summers shortened, there must have been less and less time for Greenlanders to grow hay. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century—as much as 6-8&nbsp;°C lower than modern summer temperatures.[21] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. By the mid-14th century deposits from a chieftain’s farm showed a large number of cattle and caribou remains, whereas, a poorer farm only several kilometers away had no trace of domestic animal remains, only seal. Bone samples from Greenland Norse cemeteries confirm that the typical Greenlander diet had increased by this time from 20% sea animals to 80%.[22]</p><p>Although Greenland seems to have been uninhabited at the time of initial Norse settlement, the Thule people migrated south and finally came into contact with the Norse in the 12th century. There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as skræling. The Icelandic Annals are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.[23] Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference—an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them—or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.[citation needed]</p><p>The Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of kayak navigation or ring seal hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement. By 1350, the Norse had completely deserted their Western Settlement.[24] The Inuit, being a hunting society, may have hunted the Norse livestock, forcing the Norse into conflict or abandonment of their settlements.[citation needed]</p><p>In mild weather conditions, a ship could make the 900-mile (1400 kilometers) trip from Iceland to Eastern Settlement within a couple of weeks. Greenlanders had to keep in contact with Iceland and Norway in order to trade. Little is known about any distinctive shipbuilding techniques among the Greenlanders. Greenland lacks a supply of lumber, so was completely dependent on Icelandic merchants or, possibly, logging expeditions to the Canadian coast.[citation needed]</p><p>The sagas mention Icelanders traveling to Greenland to trade.[25] Settlement chieftains and large farm owners controlled this trade. Chieftains would trade with the foreign ships and then disperse the goods by trading with the surrounding farmers.[26] The Greenlanders' main commodity was the walrus tusk,[16] which was used primarily in Europe as a substitute for elephant ivory for art décor, whose trade had been blocked by conflict with the Islamic world. Professor Gudmundsson suggests a very valuable narwhal tusk trade, through a smuggling route between western Iceland and the Orkney islands.[citation needed]</p><p>It has been argued that the royal Norwegian monopoly on shipping contributed to the end of trade and contact. However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the Herjolfsnes church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding. Most had crucifixes around their necks with their arms crossed as in a stance of prayer. Roman papal records report that the Greenlanders were excused from paying their tithes in 1345 because the colony was suffering from poverty.[27] The last reported ship to reach Greenland was a private ship that was blown off course, reaching Greenland in 1406, and departing in 1410 with the last news of Greenland: the burning at the stake of a condemned witch, the insanity and death of the woman this witch was accused of attempting to seduce through witchcraft, and the marriage of the ship's captain, Thorsteinn Ólafsson, to another Icelander, Sigridur Björnsdóttir.[28] However, there are some suggestions of much later unreported voyages from Europe to Greenland, possibly as late as the 1480s.[29] In the mid-1500s, a German ship drifted off-course to Greenland and, coming ashore a small island, discovered the body of a dead man lying face down who demonstrated cultural traits of both Norse and Inuit. An Icelandic crew member of the ship wrote: He had a hood on his head, well sewn, and clothes from both homespun and sealskin. At his side lay a carving knife bent and worn down by whetting. This knife they took with them for display.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to a 2009 study, there is no evidence for perceptible contact between Iceland and Greenland after the mid fifteenth century... It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years. Presumably, the archbishop had better archives at his disposal than most people, and yet he had not heard that the Greenlanders were gone.[18]</p><p>One intriguing fact is that very few fish remains are found among their middens. This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, and may have been disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied more and more of the diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.[31]</p><p>One Inuit story recorded in the 18th century tells that raiding expeditions by European ships over the course of three years destroyed the settlement, after which many of the Norse sailed away south and the Inuit took in some of the remaining women and children before the final attack.[11]</p><h2>Late Dorset and Thule cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png/220px-ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png" width="220" height="286"><br><p>The Thule were skilled whalers, as depicted here by Norwegian missionary Hans Egede in the 18th century.</p><p>The Norse may not have been alone on the island when they arrived; a new influx of Arctic people from the west, the Late Dorset culture, may predate them.[6] However, this culture was limited to the extreme northwest of Greenland, far from the Norse who lived around the southern coasts. Some archaeological evidence may point to this culture slightly predating the Norse settlement. It disappeared around 1300, around the same time as the westernmost of the Norse settlements disappeared. In the region of this culture, there is archaeological evidence of gathering sites for around four to thirty families, living together for a short time during their movement cycle.</p><p>Around 1200, another Arctic culture, the Thule, arrived from the west, having emerged 200 years earlier in Alaska. They settled south of the Late Dorset culture and ranged over vast areas of Greenland's west and east coasts. These people, the ancestors of the modern Inuit, were flexible and engaged in the hunting of almost all animals on land and in the ocean, including big whales. They had dogs, which the Dorset did not, and used them to pull the dog sledges; they also used bows and arrows, contrary to the Dorset. Increasingly settled, they had large food storages to avoid winter famine. The early Thule avoided the highest latitudes, which only became populated again after renewed immigration from Canada in the 19th century.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The nature of the contacts between the Thule, Dorset and Norse cultures is not clear, but may have included trade elements. The level of contact is currently the subject of widespread debate, possibly including Norse trade with Thule or Dorsets in Canada or possible scavenging of abandoned Norse sites (see also Maine penny). No Norse trade goods are known in Dorset archaeological sites in Greenland; the only Norse items found have been characterized as exotic items. Carved screw threads on tools and carvings with beards found in settlements on the Canadian Arctic islands show contact with the Norse. Some stories tell of armed conflicts between, and kidnappings by, both Inuit and Norse groups. The Inuit may have reduced Norse food sources by displacing them on hunting grounds along the central west coast. These conflicts can be one contributing factor to the disappearance of the Norse culture as well as for the Late Dorset, but few see it as the main reason.</p><h2>Danish recolonization[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish colonization of Greenland</p><p>Most of the old Norse records concerning Greenland were removed from Trondheim to Copenhagen in 1664 and subsequently lost, probably in the 1728 fire there.[32] The precise rediscovery is uncertain because south-drifting icebergs during the Little Ice Age long made the eastern coast unreachable, leading to general confusion between Baffin Island, Greenland, and Spitsbergen as seen, for example, in the difficulty locating the Frobisher Strait, which was not confirmed to be a bay until 1861. Nonetheless, interest in discovering a Northwest Passage to Asia led to repeated expeditions in the area, though none were successful until Roald Amundsen in 1906 and even that success involved his being iced in for two years. Christian I of Denmark purportedly sent an expedition to the region under Pothorst and Pining to Greenland in 1472 or 1473; Henry VII of England sent another under Cabot in 1497 and 1498; Manuel I of Portugal sent a third under Corte-Real in 1500 and 1501. It had certainly been generally charted by the 1502 Cantino map, which includes the southern coastline.[32] The island was rediscovered yet again by Martin Frobisher in 1578, prompting the Danish king Frederick II to outfit a new expedition of his own the next year under the Englishman James Alday; this proved a costly failure.[32] The influence of English and Dutch whalers became so pronounced that for a time the western shore of the island itself became known as Davis Strait (Dutch: Straat Davis) after John Davis's 1585 and 1586 expeditions, which charted the western coast as far north as Disko Bay.[33]</p><p>Meanwhile, following Sweden's exit from the Kalmar Union, the remaining states in the personal union were reorganized into Denmark-Norway in 1536. In protest against foreign involvement in the region, the Greenlandic polar bear was included in the state's coat of arms in the 1660s (It was removed in 1958). In the second half of the 17th century Dutch, German, French, Basque, and Dano-Norwegian ships hunted bowhead whales in the pack ice off the east coast of Greenland, regularly coming to shore to trade and replenish drinking water. Foreign trade was later forbidden by Danish monopoly merchants.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Old_Greenland_1747.jpg/220px-Old_Greenland_1747.jpg" width="220" height="140"><br><p>A 1747 map based on Egede's descriptions, including many geographical errors common to the time.</p><p>From 1711 to 1721,[34] the Norwegian cleric Hans Egede petitioned King Frederick IV for funding to travel to Greenland and re-establish contact with the Norse settlers there. Presumably, such settlers would still be Catholic or even pagan and he desired to establish a mission among them to spread the Reformation.[35] Frederick permitted Egede and some Norwegian merchants to establish the Bergen Greenland Company to revive trade with the island but refused to grant them a monopoly over it for fear of antagonizing Dutch whalers in the area.[36] The Royal Mission College assumed superintendency over the mission and provided the company with a small stipend. Egede found but misidentified the ruins of the Norse colony, went bankrupt amid repeated attacks by the Dutch, and found lasting conversion of the migrant Inuit exceedingly difficult. An attempt to found a royal colony under Major Claus Paarss established the settlement of Godthåb (Good Hope) in 1728 but was a costly debacle which saw most of his soldiers mutiny[35] and his settlers killed by scurvy.[37] Two child converts sent to Copenhagen for the coronation of Christian VI returned in 1733 with smallpox, devastating the island. The same ship that returned them, however, also brought the first Moravian missionaries, who in time would convert a former angekok (Inuit shaman), experience a revival at their mission of New Herrnhut, and establish a string of mission houses along the southwest coast. Around the same time, the merchant Jacob Severin took over administration of the colony and its trade and, having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son Poul. Both of them had studied the Kalaallisut language extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College such as Otto Fabricius began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.[34]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden at the 1814 Treaty of Kiel. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like William Scoresby and Greenland-born Knud Rasmussen. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first Greenlandic-language journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.[38] During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from British North America to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the Northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 Lakagígar eruption in Iceland.</p><p>Democratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862–1863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by Fridtjof Nansen accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64°N latitude.[39] In 1911, two Landstings were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in Copenhagen, where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the status quo, as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.</p><p>By 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially Hans Egede (1686 – 1758), a Lutheran missionary called the Apostle of Greenland. He founded Greenland's capital Godthåb, now known as Nuuk. His grandson Hans Egede Saabye (1746 – 1817) continued the missionary activities.[40]</p><h2>Polar exploration[edit]</h2><p>At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including Robert Peary, explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.</p><h2>Strategic importance[edit]</h2><p>See also: History of Greenland during World War II</p><p>After Norway regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian whaler Hallvard Devold occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as Erik the Red's Land. Two years later, the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled in favor of Denmark.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/ThuleAirBase.jpg/220px-ThuleAirBase.jpg" width="220" height="70"><br><p>The Thule Air Base, established after World War II, is the northernmost base of the US Air Force</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>World War II[edit]</h3><p>During World War II, when Nazi Germany extended its war operations to Greenland, Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish Minister to the United States&nbsp;— who had already refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark&nbsp;— signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting the US Armed Forces permission to establish stations in Greenland.[41] Kauffmann did this without the knowledge of the Danish government, and consequently, the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately – none of which had any result.[41] Because of the difficulties for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful export, especially of cryolite, Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status. Its supplies were guaranteed by the United States and Canada.</p><p>One Dane was killed in combat with Germans in Greenland.[41]</p><h3>Cold War[edit]</h3><p>During the Cold War, Greenland had a strategic importance, controlling parts of the passage between the Soviet Arctic harbours and the Atlantic, as well as being a good base for observing any use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, typically planned to pass over the Arctic. The United States therefore had a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100,000,000 but Denmark did not agree to sell.[42][43] In 1951, the Kauffman treaty was replaced by another one. The Thule Air Base at Thule (now Qaanaaq) in the northwest was made a permanent air force base. In 1953, some Inuit families were forced by Denmark to move from their homes to provide space for extension of the base. For this reason, the base has been a source of friction between the Danish government and the Greenlandic people. Tensions mounted when, on January 21, 1968, there was a nuclear accident&nbsp;— a B-52 Stratofortress carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed near the base, contaminating the area with radioactive debris. Although most of the contaminated ice was cleaned up, controversy currently surrounds recently declassified information indicating that one of the bombs was not accounted for. A 1995 Danish parliamentary scandal, dubbed Thulegate, highlighted that nuclear weapons were routinely present in Greenland's airspace in the years leading up to the accident, and that Denmark had tacitly given the go-ahead for this activity despite its official nuclear free policy.</p><p>Another recent controversy surrounds the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), which the United States Air Force upgraded in recent years to a phased array radar.[44] Opponents argue that the system presents a threat to the local population, as it would be targeted in the event of nuclear war.</p><h2>Home rule[edit]</h2><p>See also: Greenlandic independence</p><p>From 1948 to 1950, the Greenland Commission studied the conditions on the island, seeking to address its isolation, unequal laws, and economic stagnation. In the end, the Royal Greenland Trading Department's monopolies were finally removed. In 1953, Greenland was raised from the status of colony to that of an autonomous province or constituent country of the Danish Realm. Greenland was also assigned its own Danish county. Despite its small population, it was provided nominal representation in the Danish Folketing.</p><p>A plantation of exotic arctic trees was created in 1954 near Narsarsuaq.[45]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg/222px-Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg" width="222" height="148"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Blok P, the largest building in Greenland and formerly home to about 1% of its population, was demolished on October 19, 2012.</p><p>Denmark also began a number of reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their dependence on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.[46] Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.</p><p>Greenland's minimal representation in the Folketing meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The Folketing approved devolution in 1978 and the next year enacted home rule under a local Landsting. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985.</p><p>Greenland Home Rule has become increasingly Greenlandized, rejecting Danish and avoiding regional dialects to standardize the country under the language and culture of the Kalaallit (West Greenland Inuit). The capital Godthåb was renamed Nuuk in 1979; a local flag was adopted in 1985; the Danish KGH became the locally administered Kalaallit Niuerfiat (now KNI A/S) in 1986. Following a successful referendum on self-government in 2008, the local parliament's powers were expanded and Danish was removed as an official language in 2009.</p><p>International relations are now largely, but not entirely, also left to the discretion of the home rule government. After leaving the EEC, Greenland signed a special treaty with it,[when?] granting it special access to the market as a constituent country of Denmark, which remains a member. Greenland is also a member of several small organizations[which?] along with Iceland, the Faroes, and the Inuit populations of Canada and Russia.[citation needed] It was one of the founders of the environmental Arctic Council in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 US–Denmark treaty by the Home Rule government. The 1999–2003 Commission on Self-Governance even proposed that Greenland should aim at Thule Air Base's removal from American authority and operation under the aegis of the United Nations.[47]</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

								&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Amt (administrative division))
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Amt is a type of administrative division governing a group of municipalities, today only in Germany, but formerly also common in other countries of Northern Europe.[1] Its size and functions differ by country and the term is roughly equivalent to a US township or county or English shire district.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Current usage[edit]</h2><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>Prevalence[edit]</p><p>The Amt (plural: Ämter) is unique to the German Bundesländer (federal states) of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.</p><p>Other German states had this subdivision in the past. Some states have similar administrative units called Samtgemeinde (Lower Saxony), Verbandsgemeinde (Rhineland-Palatinate) or Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia).</p><p>Definition[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An Amt, as well as the other above-mentioned units, is subordinate to a Kreis (district) and is a collection of municipalities. The amt is lower than district-level government but higher than municipal government, and may be described as a supra-municipality or municipal confederation. Normally, it consists of very small municipalities (Gemeinden, plural of Gemeinde).</p><p>Larger municipalities do not belong to an Amt and are called amtsfreie Gemeinden (independent municipalities); some of these municipalities may also not depend from a Kreis (district) and are called kreisfreie Gemeinden, and when they do also not belong to any other Land they are also called Stadtstaaten (plural of Stadtstaat), i.e. city-states (Berlin and Hamburg).</p><p>These large municipalities (cities, in German Städte, plural of Stadt) may be further subdivided into local offices named Ortsämter (plural of Ortsamt), each of them possibly grouping several suburbs (or small townships in rural areas) of the municipality named Ortsteile (plural of Ortsteil), named from small villages or hamlets or localities. The Ortsteil (suburb or township) may have been a former parish, but today it is meant only for civil purpose and essentially used for planning within the municipality; the Ortsamt (sometimes just named informally but confusingly as an Amt, or informally translated as an urban district) is used to offer decentralized services of the municipality within local administrative offices for the residents in neighbouring suburbs. The Ortsteil itself may also be confusingly translated as a municipality, but it is incorrect because it belongs to a city which is the only effective municipality (Gemeinde).</p><h2>Former usage[edit]</h2><h3>Denmark[edit]</h3><p>The amt (plural, amter; commonly translated as county) was an administrative unit of Denmark (and, historically, of Denmark-Norway). The counties were established by royal decree in 1662 as replacements for the former Len (fiefs). The amter were originally composed of independent towns (købstæder) and parishes, and held only small areas of responsibility. During the 20th century, they were granted responsibility for the hospital service for the non-urban population. A 1970 administrative reform reduced the number of counties to fourteen and eliminated the administrative distinction between (rural) parish and town. From then on, the amter were composed of a number of municipalities (kommuner). The reform granted the counties wider areas of responsibility, most notably running the national health service and the gymnasium secondary schools.</p><p>The Danish Municipal Reform of January 1, 2007 abolished the amter and replaced them with five administrative regions, now solely charged with running the national health service. In contrast to the amter the regions hold no authority to levy taxes. The reform re-delegated all other areas of responsibility to either the municipalities or the state. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98. See Counties of Denmark for more information about the Danish usage of the term.</p><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>In Germany an Amt was a medieval administrative district covering a manorial estate or the land owned by a castle or village. It was headed by an Amtmann, usually a lesser nobleman or cleric, appointed by a territorial lord to administer and dispense justice within the Amt.</p><h3>Netherlands and Flanders[edit]</h3><p>Ambacht can be seen as the Dutch equivalent to amt. Ambachten existed in Holland, Zeeland and Flanders up to about 1800.</p><h3>Iceland[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While Iceland was a territory of the Danish realm, amts (singular: amt; plural: ömt) were established in the country on top of the existing counties. From 1684 to 1770, Iceland as whole was a single amt in the Kingdom of Denmark but was then split into two amts: North and East Amt (Norður- og Austuramt) and South and West Amt (Suður- og Vesturamt). The latter was in 1787 split into a West Amt (Vesturamt) and South Amt (Suðuramt). Iceland was thus divided into three amts until 1872, when the South and West amts were again merged. Amts were abolished in 1904, when Iceland gained home rule from Denmark.</p><p>Amts are not used to denote a geographical region in Iceland but the name lives on in the names of two public libraries in Iceland that were established during the amt era. The Amts libraries in Akureyri and Stykkishólmur which were established as the designated archives for the North and East Amt and the West Amt respectively.</p><h3>Norway[edit]</h3><p>From 1662 to 1919, the counties of Norway were called amter. They are now referred to as fylker, a term revived from the Middle Ages.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

In the 10th century, King Harald Bluetooth became a Christian and began organizing the church, and by the 11th century, Christianity was largely accepted throughout the country. Since the Reformation in Denmark, the Church has been Evangelical Lutheran, while retaining much of its pre-Reformation liturgical traditions. The 1849 Constitution of Denmark designated the church the Danish people's church and mandates that the state support it as such.[7]</p><p>The Church of Denmark continues to maintain the historical episcopate. Theological authority is vested in bishops: ten bishops in mainland Denmark and one in Greenland, each overseeing a diocese. There is no archbishop; the Bishop of Copenhagen acts as a primus inter pares.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Organization[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Peter_Skov-Jakobsen.jpg/170px-Peter_Skov-Jakobsen.jpg" width="170" height="220"><br><p>Peter Skov-Jakobsen, current Bishop of Copenhagen since 2009</p><h3>Dioceses[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark is organized in eleven dioceses, each led by a bishop, including one for Greenland (the Faroe Islands was a twelfth diocese until 29 July 2007). There are no archbishops; the most senior bishop (primus inter pares) is the Bishop of Copenhagen, currently Peter Skov-Jakobsen. The further subdivision includes 111 deaneries and 2,200 parishes. There are about 2,400 vicars.[citation needed]</p><h3>Parishes[edit]</h3><p>Each parish has a parochial council, elected by church members in four-year terms. The parochial council leads the practical business of the local church and decides employment of personnel, including the vicar(s). The vicar is subordinate to the council, except in spiritual matters such as conducting church services and pastoral care. Both parochial councils and vicars are, however, subordinate to bishops.</p><p>Voluntary congregations[edit]</p><p>A special feature is the possibility of creating voluntary congregations (valgmenighed) within the Church. These account for a few percent of church members. They are voluntary associations, electing their own parochial council and vicar, whom they agree to pay from their own pockets. In return, they are exempt from church tax. The voluntary congregation and its vicar are subordinate to bishops, and members remain full members of the Church. Historically, when a parish was dominated by a conservative majority and rector, the liberal minority would often set up a voluntary congregation with their own rector - and vice versa. Today the voluntary congregations are often a solution for people who find the idea of a free church appealing, but wish to keep some bonds to the church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Parish optionality[edit]</p><p>Another, less commonly used feature is parish optionality (sognebåndsløsning, literally parish bond release). If a Church member is dissatisfied with the particular vicar of his residence parish, he may choose to be served by another vicar who matches better with his Christian views, for example in a neighbouring parish.</p><h3>Membership[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Religion in Denmark</p><p>According to official statistics from January 2017, 75.9% of Danes are members of the Church of Denmark.[5] Membership rates vary from 58.1% in the Diocese of Copenhagen to 85.2% in the Diocese of Viborg. In recent years, the percentage of Danes that are members of the church has been slowly declining, the most important reasons being immigration from non-Lutheran countries, withdrawal of some members, and a somewhat lower rate (61.5%) of Danish infants being christened.[9]</p><p>Any person who is baptised (usually infant baptism) into the Church of Denmark automatically becomes a member. Members may renounce their membership and later return if they wish. Excommunication is legally possible but an extraordinarily rare occurrence. Examples include declared Satanists. A church member supporting reincarnation was excommunicated, but the Supreme Court overturned the excommunication in 2005.</p><h3>Faith and church attendance[edit]</h3><p>According to the latest inquiry about 2.4% [10] of church members attend services every week, although on Christmas Eve more than a third of the population attend. However, the church is still widely used for traditional family ceremonies including christenings and confirmations. In the year 2015, 33.8% of weddings[11][2] and 83.7% funerals were performed in the Church of Denmark,[12] and 71% of adolescents in grade 7–8 were confirmed.[13] The level of weekly church attendance is similar to that in Norway and Sweden.</p><p>According to a 2009 poll, 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the Son of God, and 18% believe he is the saviour of the world.[14]</p><h2>Doctrine[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG/220px-Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG" width="220" height="331"><br><p>Communion table and baptismal font in Besser Church, Samsø</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The church is aimed at having a wide acceptance of theological views, as long as they agree with the official symbolic books as stipulated in the Danish Code of 1683. These are:</p><p>Revised versions of the Old and New Testament were authorised by the Queen in 1992. A revised Hymn Book was authorised in 2003. Both the Bible translations and the Hymn Book implied widespread public and theological debate.</p><p>Historically, there is a contrast between a liberal current inspired by N. F. S. Grundtvig and more strict, pietist or Bible fundamentalist movements (such as Indre Mission). These tensions have sometimes threatened to divide the Church. Tidehverv is a minor fraction based on a strict Lutheranism and anti-modern, national-conservative views.[15][16]</p><p>The Church of Denmark is member of the Porvoo Communion between Lutheran and Anglican Churches.</p><h3>Liturgy[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Konfirmander.jpg/220px-Konfirmander.jpg" width="220" height="308"><br><p>Children preparing to be confirmed and become members of the church</p><p>The Communion Service includes three readings from the Bible: a chapter from one of the Gospels, from one of the Epistles or another part of the New Testament and, since 1992, from the Old Testament. Texts are picked from an official list following the church year. Some liturgical features have a fixed content but are free to the form. This accounts for the Common Prayer following the sermon, where the priest is obliged to mention the royal house. Some will simply mention the Queen and all her House whereas others will list all members of the royal house by name and title.</p><p>The sermon, as in other Protestant churches, is a central part of the service. The priest takes a starting point in the text of that Sunday, but is free to form a personal message of it. At special occasions, even non-priests may be allowed to preach. Hymns are also very central. In contrast to Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, Danish congregations sit while singing and stand while listening to Bible readings.</p><p>As in other Lutheran churches, the Church of Denmark recognizes only two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. These are usually included in the Communion Service. Formerly, individual or shared confession was a condition to receive the Lord's Supper. An official confession ritual still exists, but is now used very rarely. There are also official rituals for confirmation, wedding, blessing of a civil wedding and funerals. Emergency baptism may be performed by any Christian if necessary, and later the child will then be produced in Church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Church and state[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg/220px-Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>The Church of Our Lady, the cathedral of Copenhagen and the National Cathedral of Denmark</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg/220px-RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg" width="220" height="305"><br><p>Roskilde Cathedral has been the burial place of Danish royalty since the 15th century. In 1995 it became a World Heritage Site.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Holte_Kirke_2005.jpg/220px-Holte_Kirke_2005.jpg" width="220" height="162"><br><p>A parish church in Holte</p><p>As supreme authority of the Church of Denmark, the monarch must be a member (article 6 of the Constitution). This applies to the royal princes and princesses as well, but does not apply to their spouses. Traditionally, though, every foreigner who has become a member of the royal family has converted or become a member of the church; as a result, the Prince Consort Henrik converted from Catholicism before marrying the Queen in 1968, and Mary Donaldson also converted from Presbyterianism before marrying Crown Prince Frederik in 2004.</p><h3>Freedom of religion[edit]</h3><p>With the Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Lutheran Christianity was established as the state religion. For the next century, in a time when religious wars swept Europe, harsh persecution of other faiths followed (Lutheran orthodoxy). Exceptions were granted only to foreign diplomats. For at least a period in the 16th century, small circles of clandestine Catholicism prevailed. From 1683, Roman Catholic, Reformed and Jewish congregations were allowed in the new town of Fredericia, the latter two also in Copenhagen. Non-Lutherans were also allowed in Friedrichstadt and on Nordstrand in Slesvig and in Glückstadt in Holstein. With the constitution of 1849, freedom of religion was introduced in Denmark, but Lutheranism remained the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Recognised and approved religions[edit]</p><p>A religious community does not need any state approval in order to enjoy the freedom of religion granted by the constitution. However, state-approved congregations (godkendte trossamfund) enjoy several privileges. They may conduct legal weddings, establish own cemeteries, get residence permits for foreign priests, are exempt from corporate and property tax, may apply for means from the state lottery fund, and members may tax-deduct membership fees and presents to the congregation.</p><p>Additionally, those congregations recognised by royal decree before 1970 (anerkendte trossamfund) may name and baptize children with legal effect, keep their own church registers and transcribe certificates on the basis of such registers.[6]</p><p>This legal distinction between recognised and approved communities remains, but is mainly a historical one. Communities recognised before 1970 includes only eight well-established Christian communities as well as one Jewish community. From 1970 until the 1990s only a few more Christian congregations were approved, but since 1998, a much more liberal practice has ensued. Since then, a board of independent experts decide about approval of new religious communities. The board includes professors of law, religious studies and theology and works under the Ministry of Justice, deliberately separate from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical affairs. It merely investigates whether the organisation fulfills basic definitions, such as having a doctrine, creed and cult, in order to be called a congregation of faith. In 2003, the approval of the Forn Sed religion caused some public debate.</p><h3>Lack of central authority[edit]</h3><p>The Church is in practice barred from having official positions in political or other matters, since it has no central bodies that could define such stances: nor a spiritual leader (such as an archbishop), nor a central assembly or synod. Bishops have the last say on doctrinal questions within their respective dioceses. The Queen (in practice the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Parliament are the central bodies, but they usually keep to administrative matters and abstain from interfering with spiritual questions. Church laws are rarely changed, and, when it happens, only administrative matters are affected.</p><p>Firstly, these principles are generally believed to ensure a non-sectarian, tolerant church where parishioners and priests enjoy a high degree of freedom to practise their own interpretation of Lutheran Christianity. Secondly, many Danish politicians and theologians claim that only this church-state-model will ensure the division of politics and religion, since the Church cannot interfere with political matters or even claim to speak with one voice on behalf of its members. They frequently discourage the term state church and argue it is, as its name states, the people's church.</p><p>Article 66 of the Danish Constitution stipulates a church ordinance shall be laid down by law. This promissory clause dates back from the first Constitution of 1849 but was never put into practice. It was feared that splits could occur if a central authority were created.</p><p>In very few cases have politicians deviated from their traditional hands-off course in church doctrinal matters. Where they have done so, it has been with the declared aim of preventing a possible split in the church. See the issues of Female clergy and Same-sex marriage above.</p><h3>Civil registration[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark conducts civil registration of births, deaths, change of name etc. (vital records). The keeping of such kirkebøger (church books) is a centuries-long tradition, dating from when the parish rectors were the only government representatives in rural areas. In 2002-03 the traditional church records were replaced by a new national electronic registration system called Personregistrering. After protests in 2005, the Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder announced that people who for various reasons did not want to send their registration forms (e.g. births and namings) to the local church office could now send their forms to a central office located in Nykøbing Falster.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 2010 parents' duty to report the birth of their child was abolished. Instead, it was decided that in the future it was the task of the midwives to report all births in Denmark (only when a midwife isn't present at the birth of a child are the parents still obliged to report the birth of the child).</p><p>From 1 December 2014 all applications should be submitted in digital form whenever possible.</p><h3>Economic support[edit]</h3><p>§4 in the Constitution of Denmark stipulates that The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17] On the other hand, §68 ensures that citizens are not obliged to pay personal contributions to any religion other than their own.[17] It has been questioned how these two principles can co-exist. Non-members do not pay church tax, but an additional state subsidiary accounts for 12% of the Church's income. This means every citizen, even a non-member, contributes with an average of 130 kroner annually (US$23). In addition, the bishops are high-ranking officials whose salary is fully paid by the state. In return, certain public tasks are carried out by the Church, such as conducting vital records registries and managing graveyards which are open to all denominations.</p><h3>Separation of church and state[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Kierkegaard.jpg/170px-Kierkegaard.jpg" width="170" height="252"><br><p>The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard was an outspoken advocate of separation of church and state[18]</p><p>The debate about separation of church and state emerges occasionally in Denmark. The current arrangement is supported by most political parties. It has been challenged for decades by the left wing and by atheists; more recently also by some ideological liberals and some members of free churches.</p><p>Proponents for a separation (disestablishment) argue the state church violates equality of religions and the principle of the secular state. Proponents for the current system argue that membership is voluntary, that the existence of a state church has ancient historical roots, and that the church fulfils certain administrative tasks for the state. They also argue it would be difficult to decide whether church-owned real estate should be handed over to the state or not. The former possessions of the Catholic Church were ceded to the Crown at the reformation in 1536.</p><p>According to a poll conducted by the free daily MetroXpress in April 2007, 52% wished to split church and state, 30% were against, and 18% undecided. Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, spoke out against a split: Church and state will be separated when more than half of the population are no longer members. N. F. S. Grundtvig said so, and I support that. The opposition Social Democrats also argued against a split, but said there should be more equality between denominations, possibly by a state subsidiary paid to other approved religious communities as well.[19] Immigrant groups and the Muslim society are divided on the issue, as some think official Christianity is preferable to a purely secular state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Pure equality of religions exists only in a minority of Western European countries. Besides Denmark, only the Faroe Islands, Iceland, England and Greece have official state churches, while Scotland has an officially recognised national church that is not connected to the state. Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria have official ties to Catholicism (concordat), but these ties do not extend to Catholicism being recognised as the state religion in these countries. Further there are varying degrees of public funding of the church in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Sweden in most cantons of Switzerland, and in the Alsace-Moselle region of France.</p><h3>Similar Nordic Evangelical-Lutheran churches[edit]</h3><h2>Controversial issues[edit]</h2><p>See also: Homosexuality and Lutheranism</p><h3>Female clergy[edit]</h3><p>The ordination of women, having been discussed within the church since the 1920s, has been allowed since 1948, despite some rather strong early resistance from the clergy. The then Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs was contacted by a parochial council who wished to employ a female priest. He decided there was no legal obstacle to that.[20] The first woman to become a bishop was instituted in 1995. Today two thirds of theology students are women, and the clergy is expected to have a female majority in the near future.</p><p>Among a small conservative minority, resistance to women ordained as clergy remains. In 2007 the Bishop of Viborg, known as a moderate conservative, revealed that he had given special consideration to priests who were known to be against ordained women. He had organised ordination ceremonies in such a way that new priests who so wished could avoid shaking hands with, or receiving the laying on of hands from, women ordained as priests. According to the bishop, this had happened twice in the 100 ordinations he had performed. The matter became headline news amidst a debate about Muslim fundamentalists who refuse to shake hands with members of the opposite sex. The Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Bertel Haarder, said he would discuss the matter with the bishops, but also stated that tolerance for various views should be respected. In contrast, the Minister for Employment, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, thought that the priests in question should be dismissed, as public employees are obliged to shake hands with anyone.[21]</p><h3>Same-sex marriage[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Same-sex marriage in Denmark</p><p>A 2011 poll of the Danish public found that 75.8% of Danes approve of same-sex marriages being performed in the church.[22]</p><p>According to a 2011 survey of 1137 priests, 62% of them supported same-sex marriage in the Church on the same basis as for heterosexuals, while 28% were against. A map of the results hints at the traditional west-east division, with a conservative wing being dominant in central West Jutland (the former Ringkjøbing Amt) and on Bornholm, but liberal priests dominating in most other areas.[23]</p><p>In 2004, a poll among pastors said 60% were against church marriage of same-sex couples.[24]</p><p>Early position of the church[edit]</p><p>Since Denmark approved same-sex civil unions (registered partnership) in 1989, the question of church blessing ceremonies for such unions emerged. After an enquiry from the Danish National Association of Gays and Lesbians in 1993, bishops set up a commission to reach a stance on the matter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An early stance on registered partnerships was reached in 1997. Bishops maintained that the ceremony of marriage was God's framework for the relation between a man and a woman, but this view of marriage was not affected by the fact that some people chose to live in a responsible community with a person of the same sex, approved by society, i.e. a registered partnership. The bishops disapproved of institutionalising new rituals, but couples who wished a non-ritualised marking in church of their registered partnership should be obliged. In such cases, it would be up to the rector to decide, and he should seek advice from his bishop.[25]</p><p>At this time, many churches chose to bless registered partnerships, however this blessing was distinguished from a legal ceremony, which was performed by a mayor or another municipal official.[26]</p><p>Same-sex marriages accepted[edit]</p><p>However, on 15 June 2012 the Church of Denmark made the decision to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and not merely bless them; therefore Denmark now recognises same-sex marriages. In early 2012 Minister for Equality, Ecclesiastical Affairs and Nordic Cooperation Manu Sareen introduced a bill approving same-sex marriage, which was passed in parliament in June 2012.[27] A wedding ritual with liturgy has been developed and presented to parliament by the eleven bishops who are in favor of same-sex marriages being performed in church.[28] Manu Sareen and a majority of bishops initially proposed the ritual would not declare the same-sex couple 'spouses', but 'life partners' (livsfæller, a Danish neologism), but the minister later changed his mind on this detail. Two conservative organisations within the church, Inner Mission and Lutheran Mission, as well as one of the twelve bishops, maintain their protests against same-sex marriage.[29] It will be up to each individual priest to decide whether he or she will conduct marriages of same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple was married on Friday 15 June.[30]</p><p>The process towards the official recognition of same sex marriage in the Church of Denmark began on 8 February 1973, when 'Provo Priest' Harald Søbye performed a wedding of a male couple, although not legally recognised, on a suggestion from a journalist at the newspaper Ekstra Bladet, which announced it as 'The World's First Gay Wedding'. On 25 February 1973 Harald Søbye performed another wedding, of a female couple, in a television programme. The state prosecutor investigated the cases, but concluded that the priest's use of his vestment was not illegal. Søbye had been retired in 1964 for political activism, but remained an ordained priest within the church. During the next 15 years, Søbye performed around 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples.[31]</p><p>When Denmark introduced registered partnerships in 1989, the issue of same-sex marriage for some years received little attention. Church blessings of these partnerships slowly gained ground (see above). Later, the possibility of registered partnership, or same-sex marriage, performed by the church came under discussion. The issue was brought up in an unusual way by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2004, who said he would approve of such a change, although he claimed to speak as a private person on this issue, not as prime minister.</p><p>Views among proponents vary whether such a ceremony should be called 'marriage' or merely 'registered partnership' (registreret partnerskab), as the present same-sex civil union is called. Most likely, clergy would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages or not, similar to the right to deny remarriage of divorced persons (a policy employed by a conservative minority of priests).</p><p>Constitutionality[edit]</p><p>A further controversy is that this new practice may be against the Danish constitution; §4 of the Danish constitution states: The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17]</p><p>§4 not only establish Folkekirken as the state church, but also gives certain boundaries as to what the state church is. It is forced to follow the Lutheran doctrines and if, as some critics claim [1], the Lutheran doctrines explicitly state that homosexuality is a sin then it is a violation of the constitution to allow gay marriages in the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Gay clergy[edit]</h3><p>Gay and lesbian clergy exist, and this is generally considered a strictly personal issue. Parish councils are central in selecting and employing new priests, including interviews with candidates. Once employed, parish priests are public servants and cannot be discharged except for neglect of duties, which will finally be the bishop's decision.</p><p>In 2011 a female priest serving two small island parishes was fired after controversies with the parish council of Agersø, while the neighbouring Omø supported her. She claimed to have been ousted because of her sexuality, but the parish council rejected this accusation and mentioned 'cooperation problems' as the cause. Twenty years ago she had come out as lesbian and a practitioner of sadomasochism in a Swedish TV programme.[32][33]</p><p>In 2009 a parish priest in Tingbjerg, a Copenhagen suburb, moved away from the parish to a secret address after assaults against his vicarage, his car and the parish church. The vicarage was put up for sale. According to Avisen.dk, local youths claimed they harassed him because he was openly homosexual, among other reasons.[34] The priest himself denied this was the issue, but rather claimed the assaults were part of a general tendency in the 'crumbling district', and intensified after he spoke out in public about the local youth crime.[35] A Sunday service held a few weeks later was attended by several prominent guests supporting the priest, including Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, and photographer Jacob Holdt.[36] Tingbjerg is a single-plan public housing area, marked by gang violence and youth crime, and the most criminal district of Copenhagen.[37]</p><h3>Declaration Dominus Iesus[edit]</h3><p>In 2000, the Church of Denmark's ecumenical department publicly criticized the Roman Catholic declaration Dominus Iesus, which controversially used the term ecclesial community to refer to Protestant denominations, including Lutheran churches. The Church of Denmark argued that there is a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another of the right to be called a Church and that it is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian.[38]</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Danish /'de?n??/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen) (dansk pronounced&nbsp;['dan?sg]&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen); dansk sprog, ['dan?sg 'sb??w?]) is a North Germanic language spoken by around six million people, principally in Denmark and in the region of Southern Schleswig in northern Germany, where it has minority language status.[3] There are also minor Danish-speaking communities in Norway, Sweden, Spain, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas, around 15–20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their home language.</p><p>Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples that lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic. A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as Mainland Scandinavian while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as Insular Scandinavian.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Until the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions. With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing, a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared, though there are regional variants of the standard language. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.</p><p>Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 phonemically distinctive vowels,[4] and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon stød, a kind of laryngeal phonation type. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and weakly pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand,[5] and there is some evidence that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish.[6] The grammar is moderately inflective with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. As in English, Danish only has remnants of a former case system, particularly in the pronouns, and it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is V2, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/North_Germanic_languages.svg/300px-North_Germanic_languages.svg.png" width="300" height="200"><br><p>Danish and its relation to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European</p><p>Danish is a Germanic language of the North Germanic branch. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the Old Norse language; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.[7][8]</p><p>Scandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where there are no sharp dividing lines between the different vernacular languages.[7]</p><p>Like Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.[7]</p><p>Danish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), Insular Danish (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including Bornholmian and Scanian). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.[7]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Mutual intelligibility[edit]</h3><p>Danish is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Swedish. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.[9] The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.[10] Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.[9]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Danish</p><h3>Donsk tunga[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Old Norse</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG/250px-Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG" width="250" height="184"><br><p>The approximate extent of Old Norse and related languages in the early 10th century:

Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson[11]</p><p>By the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language was generally called the Danish tongue (Donsk tunga), or Norse language (Norrœnt mál). Norse was written in the runic alphabet, first with the elder futhark and from the 9th century with the younger futhark.</p><p>From the 7th century the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Denmark and Sweden). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.[12] A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong æi (Old West Norse ei) to the monophthong e, as in stæin to sten. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin. There was also a change of au as in dauðr into ø as in døðr. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tauþr into tuþr. Moreover, the øy (Old West Norse ey) diphthong changed into ø as well, as in the Old Norse word for island. This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.[13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Through Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England. Many words derived from Norse, such as gate (gade) for street, still survive in Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia, parts of eastern England colonized by Danish Vikings. The city of York was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example are (er), knife (kniv), husband (husbond), and egg (æg).[14] The suffix -by for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby and Grimsby. The word dale meaning valley is common in Yorkshire and Derbyshire placenames.</p><h3>Old Danish[edit]</h3><p>Fangær man saar i hor seng mæth annæns mansz kunæ. oc kumær han burt liuænd....

Jutlandic Law, 1241 [15]</p><p>In the medieval period Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The Jutlandic Law and Scanian Law were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350 Danish began to be used as a language of administration and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.[16]</p><p>Throughout this period Danish was in contact with Low German, and many Low German loans were introduced in this period.[17] With the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. It is also in this period that Danish begins to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the stød the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.[18]</p><p>The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the Rimkrøniken (Rhyming Chronicle), a history book told in rhymed verses.[19] The first complete translation of the Bible in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by Christiern Pedersen was published in 1550. Pedersen's orthographic choices set the de facto standard for subsequent writing in Danish.[20]</p><h3>Early Modern Danish[edit]</h3><p>Herrer og Narre have frit Sprog.

Peder Syv, proverbs</p><p>Following the first Bible translation the development of Danish as a written language, and as a language of religion, administration and public discourse sped up. In the second half of the 17th century a number of grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them Rasmus Bartholin's 1657 Latin grammar De studio lingvæ danicæ; then Laurids Olufsen Kock's 1660 grammar of the Zealand dialect Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, Den Danske Sprog-Kunst (The Art of the Danish Language) by Peder Syv. Significant authors from this period are Thomas Kingo, poet and psalmist, and Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, whose novel Jammersminde (Remembered Woes) is considered a literary masterpiece. Orthography was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of Jens Pedersen Høysgaard was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the stød. In this period scholars were also discussing whether it was best to write as one speaks or to speak as one writes, including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. han er he is vs. de ere they are).</p><p>The East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the Treaty of Brömsebro after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, begininnig also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the de facto official standard language, especially in writing - this was the original so-called rigsdansk (Danish of the Realm). Also beginning in the mid 18th century, the skarre-R, the uvular R sound ([?]), began spreading through Denmark, probably through influence from Parisian French and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden and coastal southern Norway.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 18th century Danish philology was advanced by Rasmus Rask, who pioneered the disciplines of comparative and historical linguistics and wrote the first English language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish flourished with the works of Ludvig Holberg, whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by Hans Egede, Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language up until the mid 20th century.</p><h3>Standardized national language[edit]</h3><p>Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,

N.F.S. Grundtvig, "Modersmaalet"</p><p>Following the loss of Schleswig to Germany, a sharp influx of German speakers moved into the area, eventually outnumbering the Danish speakers. The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called Golden Age of Danish culture. Authors such as N.F.S. Grundtvig emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish language authors of this period are existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and prolific fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen.[22] The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the Schleswig referendum in 1920 a number of Danes remained as a minority within German territories.[23] Throughout the 19th Century Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina where memory and some use of Danish remains today.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png/220px-LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png" width="220" height="237"><br><p>Language shift in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig.</p><p>After the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter Å/å. Three 20th century Danish authors have become Nobel Prize laureates in Literature: Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan (joint recipients in 1917) and Johannes V. Jensen (awarded 1944).</p><p>With the exclusive use of rigsdansk, the High Copenhagenian Standard, in national broadcasting, the traditional dialects came under increased pressure. In the 20th century they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country.[24] Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called regionssprog (regional languages) remain, and are in some cases vital. Today the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagenian, associated with elderly, well to-do and well educated people of the capital, and low-Copenhagenian traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations.[25][26] Also in the 21st century the influence of immigration has had linguistic consequences, such as the emergence of a so-called multiethnolect in the urban areas, an immigrant Danish variety (also known as Perkerdansk), combining elements of different immigrant languages such as Arabic, Turkish and Kurdish, as well as English and Danish.[25]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Geographic distribution[edit]</h2><p>Danish is the national language of Denmark and one of two official languages of the Faroe Islands (alongside Faroese). Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside Greenlandic). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as lingua franca, and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speak Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English.[27]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG/220px-Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Learn Danish banner in Flensburg, Germany where it is an officially recognized regional language</p><p>In addition, there is a noticeable community of Danish speakers in Southern Schleswig, the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized regional language, just as German is north of the border. Furthermore, Danish is one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council.[28] Under the Nordic Language Convention, Danish-speaking citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.[28]</p><p>The more widespread of the two varieties of Norwegian, Bokmål, is very close to Danish, because standard Danish was used as the de facto administrative language until 1814. Bokmål is based on Danish unlike the other variety of Norwegian, Nynorsk, which is based on the Norwegian dialects, with Old Norwegian as an important reference point.[7]</p><p>There is no law stipulating an official language for Denmark, making Danish the de facto language only. The Code of Civil Procedure does, however, lay down Danish as the language of the courts.[29] Since 1997 public authorities have been obliged to observe the official spelling by way of the Orthography Law. In the 21st century there have been discussions regarding creating a language law that would make Danish the official language of Denmark.[30]</p><h2>Dialects[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish dialects</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Danishdialectmap.png/250px-Danishdialectmap.png" width="250" height="184"><br><p>Map of Danish dialects</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Denmark-stoed.png/220px-Denmark-stoed.png" width="220" height="258"><br><p>A map showing the distribution of stød in Danish dialects.

In Zealand the transition from three to two genders has happened fairly recently. West of the red line the definite article goes before the word as in English or German; east of the line it takes the form of a suffix.</p><p>Standard Danish (rigsdansk) is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital, Copenhagen. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.[24][7]</p><p>Danish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects. Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.[31][24]</p><p>Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas:</p><p>Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic. Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn and Lolland-Falster dialect areas - each with addition internal variation. The term Eastern Danish[35] is occasionally used for Bornholmian, but including the dialects of Scania (particularly in a historical context). Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish and Bornholmian. Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to Sweden and subsequently swedified.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Traditional dialects differ both in phonology, grammar and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of stød.[36] There are four main regional variants for the realization of stød: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland and Ærø, there is no stød but instead a pitch accent. South of a line (Danish: Stødgrænsen The Stød border) going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, Møn, Southern Zealand and Bornholm there is neither stød nor pitch accent.[37] In most of Jutland and on Zealand there is stød, and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language there are often more stød occurrences than in the standard language. In Zealand the stød line divides Southern Zealand (without stød), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.[38][39]</p><p>Grammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of suffixes, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as West Germanic languages. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three grammatical genders.[34] Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900 Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.[40] Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: Katti, han får unger, literally The cat, he is having kittens, because cat is a male noun, and thus are referred to as han (he), even if it is female cat.[41]</p><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish phonology</p><p>The sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody. In informal or rapid speech the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language's prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to segment the speech flow into its constituent elements.[5][42] These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and there are even indications that Danish children take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.[6]</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><p>Although somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels and two schwa vowels, /?/ and /?/ that only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes - a very large number among the world's languages.[43] At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either [i?], [u?] or [??].[44] The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by Grønnum (1998) in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in IPA for Danish. Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. Basbøll (2005):50 gives 25 full vowels, not counting the two unstressed schwa-vowels.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>The consonant inventory is comparatively simple. Basbøll (2005:73) distinguishes 16 non-syllabic consonant phonemes in Danish.</p><p>Many of these phonemes have quite different allophones in onset and coda. Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration and fortis vs. lenis.[44] /p t k/ are aspirated in onset realized as [b??, d??, g°?], but not in coda. The pronunciation of t, [d??], is in between a simple aspirated [d??] and a fully affricated [d?s] as has happened in German with many words that now contain z. The stops /b d g/ are realized as [b?, d?, g°] in onset and as [b? ð???, j/??] in coda. In syllable onset the phonemes /b d g v j r/ are contoid (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become vocoids, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, løb/ (grave, ran) are pronounced [grau?, løu?].</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>[?, ð] often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as approximants. Danish [ð] differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar approximant which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] (or [?]) by second language learners.[44]</p><p>The sound [?] is found for example in the word /sjov?/ fun pronounced [??u??] and /tjal?/ marijuana pronounced [t?al?]. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after /s/ or /t/ and [j] doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an allophone of /j/, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a /?/-phoneme in Danish.[46]</p><p>In onset /r/ is realized as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant, [?], but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic low central vowel, [??] or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the r in German or in non-rhotic pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of /r/ as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled [r].</p><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Danish is characterized by a prosodic feature called stød (lit. thrust). This is a form of laryngealization or creaky voice. Some sources have described it as a glottal stop, but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.[47] It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in minimal pairs such as bønder (peasants) with stød, versus bønner (beans) without stød. The distribution of stød in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian pitch accents found in most dialects of Norwegian and Swedish.[48]</p><p>Stress is phonemic and distinguishes words such as billigst ['bilist] cheapest and bilist [bi'list] car driver.[49]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish grammar</p><p>Similarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs tager/tog (takes/took) and fod/fødder (foot/feet)) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as elsker/elskede love/loved, bil/biler car/cars). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.[50]</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an enclitic. A distinctive feature of the Scandinavian languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. fod/fødder foot/feet, mand/mænd man/men) or weak stems inflected through affixation (e.g. skib/skibe ship/ships, kvinde/kvinder woman/women).[51]</p><p>Gender[edit]
Main article: Gender in Danish and Swedish</p><p>Standard Danish has two nominal genders: common and neuter; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the common gender, and neuter is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized.The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. [52]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Definiteness[edit]</p><p>Definiteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.[53] Neuter nouns take the clitic -et, and common gender nouns take -en. Indefinite nouns take the articles en (common gender) or et (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun en mand a man (indefinite) has the definite form manden the man, whereas the neuter noun et hus a house (indefinite) has the definite form, the house (definite) huset.[52] [54]</p><p>Indefinite:</p><p>Jeg så et hus
"I saw a house"</p><p>Definite with enclitic article:</p><p>Jeg så huset
"I saw the house"</p><p>Definite with preposed demonstrative article:</p><p>Jeg så det store hus[55]
"I saw the big house"</p><p>The plural definite ending is -(e)ne (e.g. drenge boys &gt; drengene the boys and piger girls &gt; pigerne the girls), and nouns ending in -ere lose the last -e before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. danskere Danes &gt; danskerne the Danes). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article den (common) or det (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: den store mand the big man, det store hus the big house.[56][54]</p><p>Number[edit]</p><p>There are three different types of regular plurals: Class 1 forms the plural with the suffix -er (indefinite) and -erne (definite), Class 2 with the suffix -e (indefinite) and -ene (definite.), and Class 3 takes no suffix for the plural indefinite form and -ene for the plural definite.[57]</p><p>Most irregular nouns take an ablaut plural (with a change in the stem vowel), or combine ablaut stem-change with the suffix, and some have unique plural forms. Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of øje eye, which is the old dual form øjne), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word konto account which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form konti accounts).[58][59]</p><p>Possession[edit]</p><p>Possessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -s, for example min fars hus my father's house where the noun far carries the possessive enclitic.[60] This is however not a case of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik the king of Denmark's candy factory, or det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with, where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.[61][62]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>As does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (han he), animate feminine (hun she) forms, as well as inanimate neuter (det it) and inanimate common gender (den it) [63]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Jeg sover
"I sleep"


Du sover
"you sleep"


Jeg kysser dig
"I kiss you"


du kysser mig
"you kiss me"</p><p>Possessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (det er min hest it is my horse), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (den er min it is mine). In the third person singular sin is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas hans (his), hendes (her) and dens/dets its is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.[64][65]</p><p>Han tog sin hat
He took his (own) hat


Han tog hans hat
He took his hat (someone else's hat)

Nominal compounds[edit]</p><p>Like all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in kvindehåndboldlandsholdet, the female national handball team. In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra s, originally possessive in function, like landsmand (from land, country, and mand, man, meaning compatriot), but landmand (from same roots, meaning farmer). Some words are joined with an extra e, like gæstebog (from gæst and bog, meaning guest book).</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>Danish verbs are morphologically simple, marking very few grammatical categories. They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.[66]</p><p>Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice[edit]</p><p>Verbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.[53] The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -te and those that take the suffix -ede.[67]</p><p>The infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced [?]), infinitive forms are preceded by the article at (pronounced [?]).[67] The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -r, except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.[68]</p><p>The present participle ends in -ende (e.g. løbende running), and the past participle ends in -et (e.g. løbet run), -t (e.g. købt bought). Additional composite tenses are constructed with auxiliary verbs (e.g. at være to be and at have to have) and participial forms:</p><p>Hun er gået
"She has left"


Hun har gået
"She has walked"


Hun var gået
"She had left"


Hun blev siddende
She remained seated (lit. "she stayed sitting")</p><p>The passive form takes the suffix -s: avisen læses hver dag (the newspaper is read every day). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb at blive to become: avisen bliver læst hver dag.[68][69]</p><p>The imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:</p><p>løb!
"run!"</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Danish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is Subject-Verb-Object.[70] However, Danish is also a V2 language, which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian Paul Diderichsen[71] Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or grounding) field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or topics. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.[72]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Peter (S) så (V) Jytte (O)
"Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>but</p><p>I går så (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)
"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>When there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a dummy subject der.[73]</p><p>der kom en pige ind ad døren
there came a girl in through the door
"A girl came in the door"

Main clauses[edit]</p><p>Haberland (1994, p.&nbsp;336) describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:</p><p>Position 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.[72]</p><p>Questions with wh-words are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.</p><p>Wh-question:</p><p>hvem så du?'
who saw you
"who did you see?"


så du ham?
saw you him?
"did you see him?"

Subordinate clauses[edit]</p><p>In subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).[74] Complement clauses begin with the particle at in the connector field.</p><p>Han sagde at han ikke ville gå
he said that he not would go
"He said that he did not want to go"</p><p>Relative clauses are marked by the relative articles som or der which occupy the preverbal slot:</p><p>Jeg kender en mand som bor i Helsingør[75]
"I know a man who lives in Elsinore"</p><h2>Vocabulary[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG/220px-Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Danish label reading militærpoliti, "military police", on police vehicle</p><p>About 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the Old Norse language, and ultimately from Proto Indo-European. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.[76] Danish has also absorbed a considerable number of loan words, most of which were borrowed from Middle Low German in the late medieval period. Out of the 500 most frequently used Words in Danish, 100 are Medieval loans from Middle Low German.[77] In the 17th and 18th Centuries standard German and French superseded Low German influence and in the 20th Century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after World War II. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with æde (to eat) which became less common when the Low German spise came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard text in contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16-17% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4-8&nbsp;%, French 2-4&nbsp;% and English about 1%.[77]</p><p>Danish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, Danish words for commonly used nouns and prepositions are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers, such as have, over, under, for, give, flag, salt, and kat.[78] Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their Scottish equivalents, e.g., kirke (Scottish kirk, i.e., 'church') or barn (Scottish bairn, i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word by, meaning village or town, occurs in many English place-names, such as Whitby and Selby, as remnants of the Viking occupation. During the latter period, English adopted are, the third person plural form of the verb to be, as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form they from contemporary Old Norse.</p><h3>Numerals[edit]</h3><p>In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered enogtyve, literally one and twenty.</p><p>The numeral halvanden means 1½ (literally half second, implying one plus half of the second one). The numerals halvtredje (2½), halvfjerde (3½) and halvfemte (4½) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the vigesimal system described below. Similarly, the temporal designation klokken halv tre, literally half three o'clock, is half past two.</p><p>One peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (somewhat like the French numerals from 80 through 99) based on a vigesimal system, meaning that the score (20) is used as a base unit in counting. Tres (short for tre-sinds-tyve, three times twenty) means 60, while 50 is halvtreds (short for halvtredje-sinds-tyve, half third times twenty, implying two score plus half of the third score). The ending sindstyve meaning times twenty is no longer included in cardinal numbers, but still used in ordinal numbers. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as tooghalvtreds from the now obsolete tooghalvtredsindstyve, whereas 52nd is either tooghalvtredsende or tooghalvtredsindstyvende. Twenty is tyve (derived from old Danish tiughu, a haplology of tuttiughu, meaning 'two tens'[79]), while thirty is tredive (Old Danish þrjatiughu, three tens), and forty is fyrre (Old Danish fyritiughu, four tens[80] via fyrretyve.[81] Thus, the suffix -tyve should be understood as a plural of ti (10), though to modern Danes tyve means 20, making it hard to explain why fyrretyve is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four times twenty).</p><p>For large numbers (one billion or larger), Danish uses the long scale, so that the short scale billion (1,000,000,000) is called milliard, and the short scale trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is billion.</p><h2>Writing system[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Danish orthography</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG/220px-Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Danish keyboard with keys for Æ, Ø, and Å.</p><p>The oldest preserved examples of written Danish (from the Iron and Viking Ages) are in the Runic alphabet.[82] The introduction of Christianity also brought the Latin script to Denmark, and at the end of the High Middle Ages Runes had more or less been replaced by Latin letters.</p><p>Danish orthography is highly conservative, still using most of the conventions established in the 16th century. The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a severe gap between the spoken and written languages.[83]</p><p>The modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: æ, ø, and å, which come at the end of the alphabet, in that order. A spelling reform in 1948 introduced the letter å, already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the digraph aa.[82] The old usage still occurs in some personal and geographical names (for example, the name of the city of Aalborg is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and Aarhus decided to go back to Aa in 2011). When representing the å sound, aa is treated just like å in alphabetical sorting, even though it looks like two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations (e.g., in URLs), they are often replaced by ae (Æ, æ), oe or o (Ø, ø), and aa (Å, å), respectively.</p><p>The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense vilde (would), kunde (could) and skulde (should), to their current forms of ville, kunne and skulle (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech). Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly, particularly with the phonetic spelling of loanwords; for example the spelling of station and garage in Danish remains identical to other languages, whereas in Norwegian, they are transliterated as stasjon and garasje.</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p>Åkesson, K.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Dano-Norwegian empire)
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The Danish colonial empire (Danish: danske kolonier) and pre Dano-Norwegian empire (Norwegian: Danmark-Norges kolonier) denotes the colonies that Denmark-Norway (Denmark alone after 1814) possessed from 1536 until 1953. At its apex the colonial empire spanned four continents (Europe, South America, Africa and Asia). The period of colonial expansion marked a rise in the status and power of Danes and Norwegians in the union. Being the hegemon of Denmark-Norway or the Statsfædrelandet (lit. State Fathers' Land), Denmark is where the union's monumental palaces are now located and Copenhagen, today the capital of Denmark, was the city which both Norway and Denmark came to establish as their capital. Much of the Norwegian population moved to find work in Copenhagen, attend the University, or join the Royal Fleet. At it height the empire had an area of 2,655,564.76 km2 [1]</p><p>In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in Africa, the Caribbean, and India. After 1814, when Norway was granted to Sweden following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained what remained of Norway's great medieval colonial holdings. Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway's overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe. Denmark-Norway's first colony was established at Tranquebar (Trankebar) on India's southern coast in 1620. Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.</p><p>Today, the only remaining vestiges of this empire are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953. They are now autonomous countries of the Kingdom of Denmark with home rule, in a relationship referred to as the Unity of the Realm.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Overview[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish Gold Coast</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg/250px-Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg" width="250" height="148"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>A contemporary depiction of Fort Christiansborg</p><p>Denmark maintained several tradings stations and four forts on the Gold Coast in west Africa, especially around modern day Ghana. Three trading stations were built:[2] Fort Frederiksborg, Kpompo; Osu Castle by Accra in 1661, that was purchased from Sweden; and Frederiksberg. The forts were Fort Prinsensten built in 1784, Fort Augustaborg from 1787, Fort Friedensborg and Fort Kongensten, several of which are ruins today. Of these, only one is still used today, Fort Christiansborg, which is the Ghanaian president's residence in Ghana.</p><p>Plantations were established by Frederiksborg, but they failed. Fort Christiansborg became the base for Danish power in west Africa, and the centre for slave trade to the Danish West Indies. In 1807, Denmark's African business partners were suppressed by the Akan people subgroup-Ashanti, which led to the abandonment of all trading stations. Denmark sold its forts to the United Kingdom in 1850.</p><h3>Americas[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish colonization of the Americas</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg/220px-H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg" width="220" height="178"><br><p>The Høgensborg estate on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, 1833


Greenland[edit]
Main articles: History of Greenland and Royal Greenland Trade Department</p><p>With the ratification of the Kalmar Union in 1397, Denmark-Norway inherited Greenland which was previously part of Norway since its settlement in the Viking Age. After the Norse settlement in Greenland finally disappeared in the 15th century, Europeans did not settle the island again until 1721, when the Lutheran minister Hans Egede arrived and established the town now known as Nuuk. After Norway was ceded to Sweden in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the old territorial claims as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel.</p><p>The development and settlement of Greenland accelerated in 1945, instigated by the region's geostrategic importance in the Cold War era, itself exemplified and manifested by the US-Air base of Thule from 1943. Another reason and driving force was the emergence of fundamental technical abilities, such as aircraft and icebreakers at Greenland's disposition, giving the otherwise remote island a supply situation somewhat similar to Europe.</p><p>Danish West Indies[edit]
Main articles: Danish West Indies and Danish West India Company</p><p>Denmark-Norway acquired the island of St. Thomas in 1671[2] and St. Jan (now St. John) in 1718, and bought St. Croix from France in 1733. All of the islands' economies were based primarily on sugar. These islands were known as the Danish West Indies and were eventually sold to the United States in 1917 for 25 million dollars.[2] Several Danish-American succession talks had been made since 1870 due to a rising number of riots and unrest from the poorer English speaking population. The Zahle Government (1914-1920) held a heavily boycotted election for Danish mainland constituencies, which produced a minority for the sale of the islands. The United States hoped to use them as naval bases. Since 1917, the islands have been known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish India and Danish East India Company</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png/300px-European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png" width="300" height="184"><br><p>Danish and other European settlements in India.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/250px-A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="250" height="118"><br><p>Fort Dansborg at Tranquebar, built by Ove Gjedde, c. 1658</p><p>Denmark maintained a scattering of small colonies and trading posts throughout the Indian sub-continent from the 17th to 19th centuries, after which most were sold or ceded to Britain which had become the dominant power there.[2] The most important economic aspect was spice trade and access to the east Asian area, including Imperial China situated farther to the east.</p><p>The colony at Trankebar (modern day: Tharangambadi) was kept for over 200 years, with a few interruptions, until it was sold to the British in 1845.</p><p>In 1755 Denmark acquired the Frederiksnagore (now Serampore), and later the towns of Achne and Pirapur. They are located about 25 kilometres north of Calcutta. In 1818 Serampore College was established in Serampore, which still exists today. These towns were also sold to Britain in 1845. Other colonial ventures include colonization attempts of the Nicobar Islands, called Frederiksøerne (Frederik Islands) or Ny Danmark (New Denmark) by the Danes between 1754 and 1868.</p><h3>Atlantic[edit]</h3><p>Faroe Islands[edit]
Main article: History of the Faroe Islands</p><p>As with Greenland, Denmark-Norway inherited the medieval Norwegian claims to the Faroe Islands as the successor state to Norway. The Faroes had become part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. After Norway was given to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the Faroes as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel. Status as a Danish county ended in 1948, and the Faroes were given a large degree of independence within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>Iceland[edit]

Also like those possessions, Iceland was retained by Denmark at the Treaty of Kiel. A growing independence movement in Iceland led to Denmark granting it home rule in 1874 and expanding that home rule in 1904. In 1918 Iceland became a fully sovereign kingdom, titled the Kingdom of Iceland, in personal union with Denmark.</p><p>During Nazi Germany's Occupation of Denmark (1940) the Republic of Iceland was declared on June 17, 1944.</p><h3>Danish Estonia and Courland[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish Estonia and Bishopric of Courland</p><p>In the 13th-14th centuries, Denmark ruled parts of what is now Estonia. The colony was initially named the Duchy of Estonia (Danish: Hertugdømmet Estland) and is retrospectively called Danish Estonia by historians. In 1559 the bishop of Courland and Ösel-Wiek Johannes V von Münchhausen sold his lands to the King Frederick II of Denmark for 30,000 thalers. The Danish king gave the territory to his younger brother Duke Magnus of Holstein. After Magnus of Livonia died in 1583, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth invaded his territories in the Bishopric of Courland and Frederick II of Denmark decided to sell his rights of inheritance. In 1645, Saaremaa was ceded from Denmark to Sweden by the Treaty of Brömsebro.</p><h2>Demise[edit]</h2><p>The downfall of the Danish colonial empire was caused by a lack of resources.[2] The empire was quickly eclipsed by those of France, Britain and the Netherlands. Eventually Denmark sold its colonies in India to Britain.[2]</p><h2>Legacy[edit]</h2><p>Greenland and the Faroe Islands are the last vestiges of the colonial empire. Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953, and it became an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It gained home rule in 1979 and further autonomy, including self-determination, in 2009. Likewise, the Faroes were incorporated into the Kingdom in the eighteenth century, with the status of a county, and then given home rule in 1948.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

				This article is about the Eskimo–Aleut language. For the extinct North Germanic language, see Greenlandic Norse.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut. The main variety, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the Naalakkersuisut (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, Danish. The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic. The Thule Inuit of Greenland, Inuktun or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut.</p><p>Greenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (subject) of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (subject) of a transitive verb.</p><p>Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in transitive clauses is subject–object–verb. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables switch-reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as yesterday or now or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.</p><p>When adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the Thule people in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland.</p><p>The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.[4]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg/350px-Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg.png" width="350" height="313"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.</p><p>From the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.[5]</p><p>From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.[5]</p><p>Another development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of greenlandization of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.[6] Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic. The newspaper Sermitsiaq, has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten, which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.[7][8]</p><p>Before June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish.[note 1] Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language.[2] This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an indigenous language of the Americas that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi-independent country. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be in a vulnerable state by the UNESCO Red Book of Language Endangerment.[9] The country has a 100% literacy rate.[10] As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant, a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect.[11]</p><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><p>Kalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the Eskimo–Aleut family and are closely related to the Inuit languages of Canada and Alaska. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.</p><p>The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut), which is the official language of Greenland. The name Kalaallisut is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, Inuktun (Avanersuarmiutut), spoken in the vicinity of the city of Qaanaaq (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect (Tunumiit oraasiat), spoken in the vicinity of Ammassalik Island and Ittoqqortoormiit, is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.[14] Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around Upernavik has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of Uummannaq and the Disko Bay. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in Sisimiut in the north, around Nuuk and as far south as Maniitsoq. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around Narsaq and Qaqortoq in the south.[4] Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for humans in the three main dialects. It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, maintaining the gh which has been elided in Kalaallisut, and Tunumiisut is the most innovative, having further simplified the structure by eliding the /n/.</p><p>Michael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argues for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and the Eskimo–Aleut languages in Language Relations Across Bering Strait (1998). He calls this proposed grouping the Uralo-Siberian languages.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>See also: Inuit phonology</p><p>Letters between slashes / / indicate phonemic transcription, letters in square brackets [ ] indicate phonetic transcription and letters in triangular brackets ? ? indicate standard Greenlandic orthography.</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg/250px-West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg.png" width="250" height="210"><br><p>Ranges of West Greenlandic monophthongs on a vowel chart.[15]</p><p>The Greenlandic three vowel system, composed of /i/, /u/, and /a/, is typical for an Eskimo–Aleut language. Double vowels are analyzed as two morae, so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.[16][17] The only diphthong in the language is /ai/, which occurs only at the ends of words.[18] Before a uvular consonant ([q] or [?]), /i/ is realized allophonically as [e], [?] or [?], and /u/ is realized allophonically as [o] or [?], and the two vowels are written e, o respectively (as in some orthographies used for Quechua and Aymara).[19] /a/ becomes retracted to [?] in the same environment. /i/ is rounded to [y] before labial consonants.[19] /u/ is fronted to [?] between two coronal consonants.[19]</p><p>The allophonic lowering of /i/ and /u/ before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing /i/ and /u/ as ?e? and ?o? respectively before uvulars ?q? and ?r?. For example:</p><p>/ui/ "husband" pronounced [ui].
/uiqarpuq/ "she has a husband" pronounced [ueq??p?q] and written ?ueqarpoq?.


/illu/ "house" pronounced [i??u].
/illuqarpuq/ "he has a house" pronounced [i??oq??p?q] and written ?illoqarpoq?.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic has consonants at five points of articulation: labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular. It does not have phonemic voicing contrast, but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.[note 2] The earlier palatal sibilant [?] has merged with [s] in all but a few dialects.[20] The labiodental fricative [f] is only contrastive in loanwords. The alveolar stop [t] is pronounced as an affricate [t?s] before the high front vowel /i/. Often, Danish loanwords containing ?b d g? preserve these, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example ?baaja? [pa?ja] beer and ?Guuti? [ku?t?i] God; these are pronounced exactly as /p t k/.[4]</p><h3>Phonological constraints[edit]</h3><p>The Kalaallisut syllable is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word-final /ai/.[21] Native words may only begin with a vowel or /p, t, k, q, s, m, n/; they may end only in /p, t, k, q/ or rarely /n/. Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.[22]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic prosody does not include stress as an autonomous category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters.[17] Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.[23]</p><p>Geminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.[24]</p><p>Intonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.[23][25]</p><h3>Morphophonology[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.</p><p>Greenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is /?/. The first consonant in a cluster is always assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate /tt/ is pronounced [ts] and written ?ts?. Geminate /ll/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [ç?] but is written ?gg?. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /vv/ is pronounced [f?] and written ?ff?. /v/ is also pronounced and written [f] after /?/.[26]</p><p>These assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, iglu (house), is illu in Greenlandic, where the /gl/ consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. And the word Inuktitut itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes Inuttut. The Old Greenlandic diphthong /au/ has assimilated to /aa/.</p><p>The consonant /v/ has disappeared when between /u/ and /i/ or /a/. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without [v] when suffixed to stems ending in /u/.</p><p>The vowel /i/ of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo–Aleut vowels *i and *?. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.[27] In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned morphophonologically in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *? has the variant [a] when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.[28]</p><p>The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, Inuktun, which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (Tunumiit oraasiat) has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. [??] to [t?]. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is Ittoqqortoormiit, which would appear as Illoqqortoormiut in Kalaallisut.[13][14]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg/350px-Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg" width="350" height="263"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to "parking forbidden for all vehicles".</p><p>The morphology of Greenlandic is highly synthetic and exclusively suffixing,[29] with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.[note 5] In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.[30][note 6] The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.[31]</p><p>There are few compound words, but lots of derivations.[32] The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.</p><p>The language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.[33]</p><p>In this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.[34]</p><p>The verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.[34] The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:</p><p>Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:</p><p>Sini-ppoq "(S)he sleeps"
sleep-3p/IND[note 8]</p><p>Intransitive clause with subject noun phrase:</p><p>Angut sinippoq "the man sleeps"
man.ABS sleep-3p/IND</p><p>Transitive clause with no overt arguments:</p><p>Asa-vaa "(S)he loves him/her/it"
love-3p/3p</p><p>Transitive clause with agent noun phrase:</p><p>Angut-ip asa-vaa "the man loves him/her/it"
man-ERG love-3p/3p</p><p>Transitive clause with patient noun phrase:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Arnaq asa-vaa "(S)he loves the woman"
woman.ABS love-3p/3p

Morphosyntactic alignment[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic language uses case to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.[35]</p><p>Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, instead of treating the grammatical relations as in most European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.[36] Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.[37]</p><p>Intransitive:</p><p>Anda sini-ppoq "Anda sleeps"
Anda.ABS sleep-3p/IND</p><p>Transitive with agent and object:</p><p>Anda-p nanoq taku-aa "Anda sees a bear"
Anda.ERG bear-ABS see-3p/3p

Word order[edit]</p><p>In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is AOXV / SXV, where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. Topical noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a focal subject or object as well. In spoken language also afterthought material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.[38]</p><p>On the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.[39]</p><p>In copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa "Anda bought the sweater"
Anda sweater bought
A O V</p><p>An attribute appears after its head noun.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa "Anda bought the blue sweater"
Anda sweater blue bought
A O X V</p><p>An attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:</p><p>Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq "Anda is a skilled carpenter"
Anda carpenter.IS skilled
S V APP

Coordination and Subordination[edit]</p><p>Syntactic coordination and subordination is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.[40] The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.[41]</p><p>Obviation and switch-reference[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as obviation[42] or switch-reference.[43] There is a special so-called fourth person[44] used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.[45] Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>illu-a taku-aa "he saw his (the other man's) house"

Eva come.in-4p sleep-expect-3p


Eva iser-pat sini-ssaa-q When Eva comes in (s)he'll sleep (someone else).
Eva come.in-3p sleep-expect-3p

Indefiniteness construction[edit]</p><p>There is no category of definiteness in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors, morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive[46][47] or intransitive object[48] conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.[49][50] This view, however, is controversial.[51]</p><p>Active:</p><p>Piitap arfeq takuaa "Peter saw the whale"
Peter-ERG whale see</p><p>Antipassive/intransitive object:</p><p>Piitaq arfermik takuvoq "Peter saw (a) whale"
Peter-ABS whale-INSTR see</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>The morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are inflection and derivation. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and voice (tense/aspect is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).[52][53][54] Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by adverbs in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as postbases rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.[55] Such semantically heavy suffixes may express concepts such as to have, to be, to say, or to think. The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.</p><p>Inflection[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.[56] The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.[57]</p><p>Indicative and interrogative moods[edit]</p><p>The indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing questions. Questions with the question particle immaqa maybe cannot use the interrogative mood.[58]</p><p>napparsima-vit? "Are you sick?"

The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).</p><p>Table 6 shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb asa- to love (an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection).</p><p>Imperative and Optative moods[edit]</p><p>The imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.[59]</p><p>sini-git! "Sleep!"

Causative mood[edit]</p><p>The causative mood (sometimes called the conjunctive) is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning because, since or when; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of that. The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.[61]</p><p>qasu-gami innar-poq "He went to bed because he was tired"

Contemporative mood[edit]</p><p>The contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.[62]</p><p>qasu-llunga angerlar-punga "Being tired, I went home"

Participial mood[edit]</p><p>The participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.[63]</p><p>atuar-toq taku-ara "I saw her read/I saw that she read"

Derivation[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Verbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words.

Time reference and aspect[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,[64] and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of tense markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:[65]</p><p>toqo-riikatap-poq "He died long ago"[66]
die-long.ago-3p/IND
nere-qqammer-punga "I ate recently"[66]
eat-recently-I/IND
ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq "Yesterday Peter was running."[67]
yesterday Peter-ABS run-3p/IND</p><p>All other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal aktionsart.[67]</p><p>Piitaq arpap-poq "Peter runs"[67]
Peter-ABS run-3p/IND
Piitaq ani-voq "Peter was gone out"[67]
Peter-ABS go.out-3p/IND</p><p>But if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.[68]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. sar expressing habituality and ssaar expressing stop to.[69] Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: sima and nikuu. sima can occur in several positions with obviously different function[70] Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.</p><p>tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq "Apparently, she had arrived"[71]
arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/INT</p><p>With atelic verbs, there is a regular contrast between indirective evidentiality marked by sima and witnessed evidentiality marked by nikuu.[72] Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and sima sometimes is marked.[73]</p><p>qia-sima-voq "He cried (his eyes are swollen)"
cry-SIMA-3p/IND
qia-nikuu-voq "He cried (I was there)"
cry-NIKUU-3p/IND[72]</p><p>In the written language[66] and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.[74] That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.</p><p>Just as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:</p><p>e.g. Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu "I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer."

expect-I/3p/IND summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p



 

e.g. Aggiuti-ler-para "I've started to bring him."

bring-begin-I/3p/IND



 

e.g. Qimmi-t nirukkar-niar-nigik "Let us feed the dogs, ok?"[76]

dog-PL feed-please-we/them/IMP</p><p>While the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.[77][78] However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.[79]</p><p>Noun incorporation[edit]</p><p>There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.[47][80][81][82][83][84] This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.[85] Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.[86][87][88] The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>qimmeq dog + -qar- have (+ -poq 3p)</p><p>qimme-qar-poq "She has a dog"</p><p>illu house + -'lior- make</p><p>illu-lior-poq "She builds a house"</p><p>kaffi coffee + -sor- drink/eat</p><p>kaffi-sor-poq "She drinks coffee"</p><p>puisi seal + -nniar- hunt</p><p>puisi-nniar-poq "She hunts seal"</p><p>allagaq letter + -si- receive</p><p>allagar-si-voq "She has received a letter"</p><p>anaana mother + -a- to be</p><p>anaana-a-voq "She is a mother"</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.[89] Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. atuar- to read + -fik place becomes atuarfik school and atuarfik + -tsialak something good becomes atuarfitsialak good school.</p><p>The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.[90][note 10]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>There are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.[91]</p><p>Personal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:</p><p>ilin-nut niri-qu-aa
thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.
'He told you to eat it'

Case[edit]</p><p>The two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.</p><p>angu-t neri-voq "The man eats"

Possession[edit]</p><p>In Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.[97] Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of illu house. Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.</p><p>Anda-p illu-a "Anda's house"

Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word palasi priest is a loan from the Danish præst. But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. qarasaasiaq computer which literally means artificial brain. This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.[4] For example the root for tongue oqaq is used to derive the following words:</p><p>Lexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.[4]</p><h2>Orthography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG/220px-%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>? in a Greenlandic–Danish dictionary from 1926</p><p>Greenlandic is written with the Latin script. The alphabet:</p><p>A E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V</p><p>To spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters B, C, D, X, Y, Z, W, Æ, Ø and Å are used.[98][99] Greenlandic uses the symbols ... and&nbsp;»...«&nbsp;as quotation marks.</p><p>From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt. This alphabet employed the special character kra (?' / ?) which was replaced by q in the 1973 reform.[100] In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name Kalaallit Nunaat was spelled Kalâdlit Nunât. This scheme uses a circumflex accent ( ˆ ) to indicate a long vowel (e.g., ât/ît/ût, modern: aat, iit, uut), an acute accent ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e., á, í, ú modern: a(kk), i(kk), u(kk))] and, finally, a tilde ( ˜ ) or a grave accent ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g., ãt, it, ut or àt, ìt, ùt, modern: aatt, iitt, uutt). The letters ê and ô, used only before r and q, are now written ee and oo in Greenlandic. The spelling system of Nunatsiavummiutut, spoken in Nunatsiavut in northeastern Labrador, is derived from the old Greenlandic system.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)[101] whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.</p><h3>Sample text[edit]</h3><p>Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik.

				For other people with the same name, see Margaret of Denmark (disambiguation).</p><p>Margrethe II (Danish: Margrethe 2., pronounced&nbsp;[m?'g?æ??d?]; Faroese: Margreta 2.; Greenlandic: Margrethe II; full name: Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid; born 16 April 1940) is the Queen of Denmark. She is also the supreme authority of the Church of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defence Forces. Born into the House of Glücksburg, a royal house with origins in Northern Germany, she was the eldest child of Frederick IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden. She succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972, having had become heir presumptive to her father in 1953, when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. On her accession, Margrethe became the first female monarch of Denmark since Margaret I, ruler of the Scandinavian countries in 1375–1412 during the Kalmar Union. In 1967, she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, with whom she has two sons: Crown Prince Frederik (born 1968) and Prince Joachim (born 1969). She has been on the Danish throne for 45 years, becoming the second longest-reigning Danish monarch after her ancestor Christian IV.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Amalienborg_cph.jpg/220px-Amalienborg_cph.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg, photographed in 2006</p><p>Princess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as the first child of Crown Prince Frederick, later King Frederick IX and Crown Princess Ingrid, later Queen Ingrid. Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, and Crown Princess Margaret, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her birth took place just one week after Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940.[2]</p><p>She was baptised on 14 May in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen.[2] The Princess's godparents were: King Christian X (paternal grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V of Sweden (maternal great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (maternal grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (her maternal uncle); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (maternal grandmother's father).</p><p>She was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, Queen Alexandrine, and Ingrid after her mother, Crown Princess Ingrid. Since her paternal grandfather was also the King of Iceland, she was given an Icelandic name, Þórhildur (Thorhildur).[3]</p><p>When Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her first sister, Princess Benedikte, was born. Princess Benedikte later married Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister Princess Anne Marie was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married Constantine II of Greece and now lives in Greece.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Margrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at Gråsten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.</p><h2>Heir presumptive[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg/220px-Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg" width="220" height="270"><br><p>Princess Margrethe in 1966.</p><p>At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the Glücksburg branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle Prince Knud would one day assume the throne.</p><p>The process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new Act of Succession permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive.[2]</p><p>On her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the Council of State. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.[2]</p><p>In 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to Los Angeles, and to the Paramount Studios, where they were met by several celebrities, including Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley.[4]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><p>Margrethe was educated at the private school N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen from which she graduated in 1959. She spent a year at North Foreland Lodge, a boarding school for girls in Hampshire, England,[5] and later studied prehistoric archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge, during 1960–1961, political science at Aarhus University between 1961 and 1962, attended the Sorbonne in 1963, and was at the London School of Economics in 1965.[6] She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[2]</p><p>Queen Margrethe is fluent in Danish, French, English, Swedish and German, and has a limited knowledge of Faroese.[2][6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Marriage and children[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg/220px-Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Queen Margrethe II and her consort, Prince Henrik, in 2010.</p><p>Princess Margrethe married a French diplomat, Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, 10 June 1967, at the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen. Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish throne.[2]</p><p>Margrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son Frederik. A second child, named Joachim, was born 7 June 1969.[2]</p><h2>Reign[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Faroe_stamp_302_Queen_Margrethe.jpg/200px-Faroe_stamp_302_Queen_Margrethe.jpg" width="200" height="308"><br><p>Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the Faroese people. Stamp FR 302 of Postverk Føroya, Faroe Islands, issued 14 January 1997.</p><h3>Succession[edit]</h3><p>Shortly after King Frederick IX had delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he fell ill. At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne, becoming the first female Danish sovereign under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace 15 January 1972, by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style By the Grace of God, Queen of Denmark (Danish: Margrethe den Anden, af Guds Nåde Danmarks Dronning). The Queen chose the motto: God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.[6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said:</p><p>My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.[7]</p><h3>Constitutional role[edit]</h3><p>The Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc.</p><p>As an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.[2]</p><p>After an election where the incumbent Prime Minister does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a “Dronningerunde” (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the Danish political parties.[8]</p><p>Each party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal Det Radikale Venstre did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the Folketing, is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history that any party has held a majority on its own.)</p><p>Once the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State (privy council), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the Cabinet of Denmark.</p><p>In addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires), an infantry regiment of the British Army, following a tradition in her family.[2]</p><h3>Ruby Jubilee[edit]</h3><p>Queen Margrethe II celebrated her Ruby Jubilee, the 40th year on the throne, 14 January 2012.[9] This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace and numerous TV interviews.</p><h3>Immigration debate[edit]</h3><p>In 2016 an interview within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.[10][11]</p><h2>Personal life and interests[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official residences of the Queen and the Prince Consort are Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen and Fredensborg Palace. Their summer residence is Gråsten Palace near Sønderborg, the former home of the Queen's mother, Queen Ingrid, who died in 2000.</p><p>Margrethe is an accomplished painter, and has held many art shows over the years. Her illustrations—under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer—were used for the Danish edition of The Lord of the Rings, which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to J. R. R. Tolkien who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's poetry collection Cantabile. She is also an accomplished translator and is said to have participated in the Danish translation of The Lord of the Rings.[6] Another skill she possesses is costume designing, having designed the costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet's production of A Folk Tale and for the 2009 Peter Flinth film, De vilde svaner (The Wild Swans).[2][12] She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices. Margrethe also wears designs by former Pierre Balmain designer Erik Mortensen, Jørgen Bender, and Birgitte Taulow.[13] The Guardian in March 2013 listed her as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s.[14]</p><p>Margrethe is a chain smoker, and she is famous for her tobacco habit.[15] However, on 23 November 2006, the Danish newspaper B.T. reported an announcement from the Royal Court stating that in future the Queen would smoke only in private.[16]</p><p>A statement in a 2005 authorized biography about the Queen (entitled Margrethe) focused on her views of Islam: We are being challenged by Islam these years. Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction.[17]</p><p>Queen Margrethe II visited the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, in Nanjing, April 27, 2014. The Queen said the Memorial Hall records the darkest part of history in 77 years. We cannot change the cruel history, but can learn a historic lesson and experience from it. Today, we commemorate Sindberg. We need not only to review the past, but also need to face up to the future, she said. Margrethe II and Prince Henrik watered a tree symbolizing peace, on the square outside the Memorial Hall. They also laid down a yellow rose, named by Sindberg’s hometown as Forever Nanjing, Sindberg Yellow Rose in 2004.</p><h2>Family[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish Royal Family</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg/220px-Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Her Majesty surrounded by her family waving to crowds on her 70th birthday in April 2010.

The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight.[166] In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).[167]</p><p>The aerospace industry remains a major sector of the local economy.[168] Major aerospace companies in Bristol include BAE Systems, a merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and BAe (the latter a merger of BAC, Hawker Siddeley and Scottish Aviation). Airbus[169] and Rolls-Royce are also based at Filton, and aerospace engineering is an area of research at the University of the West of England. Another aviation company in the city is Cameron Balloons, who manufacture hot air balloons;[170] each August the city hosts the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, one of Europe's largest hot-air balloon festivals.[171]</p><p>In 2005 Bristol was named by the UK government one of England's six science cities.[172][173] A £500&nbsp;million shopping centre, Cabot Circus, opened in 2008 amidst predictions by developers and politicians that the city would become one of England's top ten retail destinations.[174] The Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries around Bristol Temple Meads railway station,[175] was announced in 2011[176] and launched the following year.[175] The 70-hectare (170-acre) Urban Enterprise Zone has streamlined planning procedures and reduced business rates. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other designated enterprise areas in the region:[177] Avonmouth, Bath, Bristol and Bath Science Park in Emersons Green, Filton, and Weston-super-Mare. Bristol is the only big city whose wealth per capita is higher than that of Britain as a whole. With a highly skilled workforce drawn from its universities, Bristol claims to have the largest cluster of computer chip designers and manufacturers outside Silicon Valley. The wider region has one of the biggest aerospace hubs in the UK, centred on Airbus, Rolls-Royce and GKN at Filton airfield.[178]</p><br><img alt="A panoramic view looking over a cityscape of office blocks, old buildings, church spires and a multi-story car park.

In 2008 the city was a finalist for the 2008 European Capital of Culture, although the title was awarded to Liverpool.[179]</p><p>The Bristol Old Vic, founded in 1946 as an offshoot of The Old Vic in London, occupies the 1766 Theatre Royal (607 seats) on King Street; the 150-seat New Vic (a studio-type theatre), and a foyer and bar in the adjacent Coopers' Hall (built in 1743). The Theatre Royal, a grade I listed building,[180][181] is the oldest continuously operating theatre in England.[182] The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (which originated in King Street) is a separate company, and the Bristol Hippodrome is a 1,951-seat theatre for national touring productions. Other smaller theatres include the Tobacco Factory, QEH, the Redgrave Theatre at Clifton College and the Alma Tavern. Bristol's theatre scene features several companies as well as the Old Vic, including Show of Strength, Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory and Travelling Light. Theatre Bristol is a partnership between the city council, Arts Council England and local residents to develop the city's theatre industry.[183] Several organisations support Bristol theatre; the Residence (an artist-led community) provides office, social and rehearsal space for theatre and performance companies,[184] and Equity has a branch in the city.[185]</p><p>The city has many venues for live music, its largest the 2,000-seat Colston Hall named after Edward Colston. Others include the Bristol Academy, The Fleece, The Croft, the Exchange, Fiddlers, the Victoria Rooms, Trinity Centre, St George's Bristol and several pubs, from the jazz-oriented The Old Duke to rock at the Fleece and indie bands at the Louisiana.[186][187] In 2010 PRS for Music called Bristol the UK's most musical city, based on the number of its members born there relative to the city's population.[188] Since the late 1970s Bristol has been home to bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, and trip hop and Bristol Sound artists such as Tricky,[189] Portishead[190] and Massive Attack;[191] the list of bands from Bristol is extensive. The city is a stronghold of drum and bass, with artists such as Roni Size's Mercury Prize-winning Reprazent,[192] as DJ Krust[193] and More Rockers.[194] This music is part of the Bristol urban-culture scene which received international media attention during the 1990s.[195]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery houses a collection encompassing natural history, archaeology, local glassware, Chinese ceramics and art. The M Shed museum opened in 2011 on the site of the former Bristol Industrial Museum.[196] Both are operated by Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, which also runs three historic houses?—?the Tudor Red Lodge, the Georgian House and Blaise Castle House?—?and Bristol Archives.[197] The 18th- and 19th-century portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, 19th-century architect Francis Greenway (designer of many of Sydney's first buildings) were born in the city. The graffiti artist Banksy is believed to be from Bristol, and many of his works are on display in the city.[198]</p><p>The Watershed Media Centre and Arnolfini gallery (both in dockside warehouses) exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema, and the city's oldest gallery is at the Royal West of England Academy in Clifton.[199] The nomadic Antlers Gallery opened in 2010, moving into empty spaces on Park Street, on Whiteladies Road and in the Purifier House on Bristol's Harbourside.[200] Stop motion animation films and commercials (produced by Aardman Animations) are made in Bristol.[201] Bristol is home to the regional headquarters of BBC West and the BBC Natural History Unit.[202] Locations in and around Bristol have featured in the BBC's natural-history programmes, including Animal Magic (filmed at Bristol Zoo).[203]</p><p>Bristol is the birthplace of 18th-century poets Robert Southey[204] and Thomas Chatterton.[205] Southey (born on Wine Street in 1774) and his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, married the Fricker sisters from the city.[206] William Wordsworth spent time in Bristol,[207] where Joseph Cottle published Lyrical Ballads in 1798.

During the mid-19th century Bristol Byzantine, a style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen in the city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period,[215] and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.[216]</p><p>The oldest Grade I listed buildings in Bristol are religious. St James' Priory was founded in 1129 as a Benedictine priory by Earl Robert of Gloucester, the illegitimate son of Henry I.[217] The second oldest is Bristol Cathedral and its associated Great Gatehouse.[218] Founded in 1140, the church became the seat of the bishop and cathedral of the new Diocese of Bristol in 1542. Most of the medieval stonework, particularly the Elder Lady Chapel, is made from limestone taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas.[219] Amongst the other churches included in the list is the 12th century St Mary Redcliffe which is the tallest building in Bristol. The church was described by Queen Elizabeth I as the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.[220]</p><p>Secular buildings include The Red Lodge, built in 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge for a larger house that once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in Georgian times and restored in the early 20th century.[221] St Bartholomew's Hospital is a 12th-century town house which was incorporated into a monastery hospital founded in 1240 by Sir John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr (c.?1277–1347), and became Bristol Grammar School from 1532 to 1767, and then Queen Elizabeth's Hospital 1767–1847. The round piers predate the hospital, and may come from an aisled hall, the earliest remains of domestic architecture in the city, which was then adapted to form the hospital chapel.[222] Three 17th-century town houses which were attached to the hospital were incorporated into model workers' flats in 1865, and converted to offices in 1978. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652[223] to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow[224] on King Street and the Hatchet Inn.[225]</p><p>Manor houses include Goldney Hall, where the highly decorated Grotto dates from 1739.[226] Commercial buildings such as the Exchange[227] and Old Post Office[228] from the 1740s are also included in the list. Residential buildings include the Georgian Portland Square[229] and the complex of small cottages around a green at Blaise Hamlet, which was built around 1811 for retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House.[230] The 18th-century Kings Weston House, in northern Bristol, was designed by John Vanbrugh and is the only Vanbrugh building in any UK city outside London. Almshouses[231] and pubs from the same period[232] intermingle with modern development. Several Georgian squares were designed for the middle class as prosperity increased during the 18th century.[233] During World War II, the city centre was heavily bombed during the Bristol Blitz.[234] The central shopping area near Wine Street and Castle Street was particularly hard-hit, and the Dutch House and St Peter's Hospital were destroyed. Nevertheless, in 1961 John Betjeman called Bristol the most beautiful, interesting and distinguished city in England.[235]</p><h3>Sport[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Sport in Bristol</p><p>Bristol has teams representing all the major national sports. Bristol City and Bristol Rovers are the city's main football clubs. Bristol Rugby (Rugby Union) and Gloucestershire County Cricket Club are also based in the city.</p><p>The two Football League clubs are Bristol City and Bristol Rovers?—?the former being the only club from the city to play in the precursor to the Premier League. Non-league clubs include Mangotsfield United, Bristol Manor Farm and Brislington. Bristol City, formed in 1897, were Division One runners-up in 1907 and lost the FA Cup final in 1909. In the First Division in 1976, they then sank to the bottom professional tier before reforming after a 1982 bankruptcy. Bristol City were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007, losing to Hull City in the playoff for promotion to the Premier League that season.[236]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="In the foreground twentieth century housing can be seen amidst trees and on the right a tower block of flats.

They were third-tier champions twice (Division Three South in 1952–53 and Division Three in 1989–90), Watney Cup Winners (1972) and runners-up for the Johnstone's Paint Trophy (2006–07) although have never played in England's top Division. The club has planning permission for a new 21,700-capacity all-seater stadium at the University of the West of England's Frenchay campus. Construction was due to begin in mid-2014, but in March 2015 the sale of the Memorial Stadium site (needed to finance the new stadium) was in jeopardy.[237][238] Bristol Academy Women's Football Club is based at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.[239]</p><p>The city is also home to Bristol Rugby,[240] formed in 1888 as Bristol Football Club by the merger of the Carlton club with rival Redland Park. Westbury Park declined the merger and folded, with many of its players joining Bristol.[241] Bristol Rugby has often competed at the highest level of the sport since its formation in 1888.[242] The club played at the Memorial Ground, which it shared with Bristol Rovers from 1996. Although Bristol Rugby owned the stadium when the football club arrived, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes led to a transfer of ownership to Bristol Rovers. In 2014 Bristol Rugby moved to their new home, Ashton Gate Stadium (home to Bristol Rovers' rivals Bristol City), for the 2014–15 season.[243][244] Dating from 1901, the Bristol Combination and its 53 clubs promote rugby union in the city and help support Bristol Rugby.[245] The most prominent of Bristol's smaller rugby clubs include Clifton Rugby, Dings Crusaders, and Cleve. Rugby league is represented in Bristol by the Bristol Sonics.[246]</p><p>The first-class cricket club Gloucestershire County Cricket Club[247] has its headquarters and plays the majority of its home games at the Bristol County Ground, the only major international sports venue in the south west of England. It was formed by the family of W. G. Grace.[248] The club is arguably Bristol's most successful, achieving a period of success between 1999 and 2006 when it won nine trophies and became the most formidable one-day outfit in England, including winning a double double in 1999 and 2000 (both the Benson and Hedges Cup and the C&amp;G Trophy), and the Sunday League in 2000. Gloucestershire CCC also won the Royal London One-Day Cup in 2015.</p><p>The Bristol Flyers basketball team have competed in the British Basketball League, the UK's premier professional basketball league, since 2014.[249] Bristol Aztecs play in Britain's premier American football competition, the BAFA National Leagues.[250] In 2009 ice hockey returned to Bristol after a 17-year absence, with the Bristol Pitbulls playing at Bristol Ice Rink; after its closure, it shared a venue with Oxford City Stars.[251] Bristol sponsors an annual half marathon and hosted the 2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.[252] Athletic clubs in Bristol include Bristol and West AC, Bitton Road Runners and Westbury Harriers. Bristol has staged finishes and starts of the Tour of Britain cycle race[253] and facilities in the city were used as training camps for the 2012 London Olympics.[254] The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, a major UK hot-air ballooning event, is held each summer at Ashton Court.[255]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="A large number of hot air balloons taking off from a field which is surrounded by tents and stalls.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The coat of arms of Greenland is a blue shield featuring a silver polar bear. This symbol was first introduced in the coat of arms of Denmark in 1666[1] and it is still represented in the arms of the Danish royal family. In a Danish context, the bear was originally shown walking naturally, but an upright position was specified in 1819. The 1470 London Roll shows an arms captioned Le Roy de Greneland featuring a shield depicting a polar bear surrounded by three birds. This royal title did not reflect any official title, but merely that the arms could be used by anyone controlling Greenland.[2]</p><p>The version currently used by the government of Greenland was designed by Greenlandic artist Jens Rosing and adopted on May 1, 1989 by the Landsting. The polar bear symbolizes the fauna of Greenland and the blue (azure) colour designates the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean Greenland is washed by. Instead of the Danish version in the royal arms which follows the heraldic tradition in raising the right forepaw, the polar bear on the Greenlandic coat of arms raises the left forepaw, due to the traditional Inuit belief that polar bears are left-handed.[3] A similar arms is used by the official Danish government representative in Greenland. In this case, the bear raises its right paw, and the shield is crowned with the royal crown.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official Danish specification of the arms does not specify which forepaw is raised, so there is no conflict between the different versions.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Nuuk (Greenlandic pronunciation:&nbsp;[nu?k]; Danish: Godthåb)[2] is the capital and largest city of Greenland and the municipality of Sermersooq. It is the seat of government and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains almost a third of Greenland's population, and also has the tallest building in Greenland. Nuuk is the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2016, it had a population of 17,316,[3] making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population.</p><p>Nuuk is the Kalaallisut word for cape. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°10' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, located only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. Since 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the new Sermersooq municipality,[4] linking the town centre with the outlying districts and neighborhoods[5] of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa.[6] In 2012 the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk. The campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland, and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland[7] is located at the northern end of the district, near the road to the Nuuk Airport.[8]</p><p>Nuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[9][10]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq.[11] For a long time it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Viking explorers in the 10th century (Western Settlement), and shortly thereafter by Inuit peoples.[12] Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the Norse settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Egede_nuuk.JPG/200px-Egede_nuuk.JPG" width="200" height="134"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The statue of Hans Egede in Nuuk.</p><p>The city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony (Haabets Koloni) from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Danish colony under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[13] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[14] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[15] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940 when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[16]</p><p>In 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (Danish: Nye-Hernhut). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864),[17] before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.[18]</p><p>Around 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and perceived the Greenlanders had lost much of their culture and identity under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the Atuagagdliutt, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became significant for the Greenlandic identity.</p><p>During World War II, there was a reawakening to Greenlandic national identity. Greenlanders shared a written language and assembled a council under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. Under new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernise Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[19]</p><p>An article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[20] suggested worldwide,</p><p>One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland’s population of 58,000 is Inuit, and least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[20]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>See also: Nuup Kangerlua</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Godthaabsfjord.jpg/200px-Godthaabsfjord.jpg" width="200" height="134"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Nuukair.jpg/200px-Nuukair.jpg" width="200" height="133"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Left: Satellite view.

Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at 64°43'N 50°37'W? / ?64.717°N 50.617°W? / 64.717; -50.617, splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua.[23] The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately 64°03'N 51°58'W? / ?64.050°N 51.967°W? / 64.050; -51.967. Some 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) to the northeast, reaching a height of 1,210&nbsp;m (3,970&nbsp;ft), Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper Sermitsiaq. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, 790&nbsp;m (2,590&nbsp;ft), and Lille Malene, 420&nbsp;m (1,380&nbsp;ft).[24] The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.[25][26]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>Nuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen ET) with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. On 22 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 and sets at 14:20. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 03:00 and does not set until 00:00. Nuuk can get mild temperatures on brief occasions year round, with each month having recorded 13&nbsp;°C (55&nbsp;°F) or warmer. The monthly averages range from -7.5&nbsp;°C (18.5&nbsp;°F) to 8&nbsp;°C (46&nbsp;°F), whereas all-time extremes range from -32.5&nbsp;°C (-26.5&nbsp;°F) to 26.3&nbsp;°C (79.3&nbsp;°F).</p><p>The climate (6.5&nbsp;°C (43.7&nbsp;°F) in July) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees (10&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees[30] which do not sustain well.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>With 16,992 inhabitants as of 2015[update], Nuuk is by far the largest and fastest growing town in Greenland. Despite an overall decline in the country's population, there was an increase of 174 from 2014 to 2015.[31] Nuuk, Paamiut[citation needed] and Tasiilaq are the only towns in the Sermersooq commune (a third of Greenland) which have grown steadily over the last two decades. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, 3,636 were born outside the country.[32] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[33] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[24]</p><h2>Government and politics[edit]</h2><p>As the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative centre of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[24]</p><p>As of December 2015, the mayor of Nuuk is Asii Chemnitz Narup. She is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[34]</p><p>Greenland's Self Government Parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms.[35] All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women's Party.[36]</p><h3>KANUKOKA[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: KANUKOKA</p><p>KANUKOKA (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaanni Kommunit Kattuffiat) is based in Nuuk.

The organisation runs the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2012. All municipal authorities in Greenland are members of the organisation.[38] The association is overseen by Maliina Abelsen, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.[37][39]</p><h2>Economy and infrastructure[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Nuuk-port.jpg/220px-Nuuk-port.jpg" width="220" height="108"><br><p>The port of Nuuk</p><p>Although only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbour but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[40] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US $7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[24] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.</p><p>The city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[41]</p><h3>Energy[edit]</h3><p>All of Greenland's electricity is powered by the government owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[42] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[43][44]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg/220px-Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg" width="220" height="88"><br><p>University of Greenland</p><p>Nuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning.

"Ethnicities" redirects here. It is not to be confused with the academic journal.</p><p>An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral, language, social, cultural or national experiences.[1][2] Ethnicity is often an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. In some cases, it can be adopted if a person moves into another society[citation needed]. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, and physical appearance.</p><p>Ethnic groups, derived from the same historical founder population, often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to leave one ethnic group and become part of another (except for ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity as a key membership criterion).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Ethnicity is often used synonymously with ambiguous terms such as nation or people. In English, it can also have the connotation of something exotic (cf. White ethnic, ethnic restaurant, etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the founding population of an area was established.</p><p>The largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals (Han Chinese being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as tribes or clans, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity, and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Nileshwar_22.jpg/220px-Nileshwar_22.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Ethnic saris in Kerala</p><p>The term ethnic is derived from the Greek word ????? ethnos (more precisely, from the adjective ??????? ethnikos,[3] which was loaned into Latin as ethnicus). The inherited English language term for this concept is folk, used alongside the latinate people since the late Middle English period.</p><p>In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, ethnic was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate nations which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used ta ethne (the nations) to translate the Hebrew goyim the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews.[4] The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a host of men, a band of comrades as well as a swarm or flock of animals. In Classical Greek, the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by ethnic group, mostly translated as nation, people; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to foreign or barbarous nations in particular (whence the later meaning heathen, pagan).[5]</p><p>In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of peculiar to a race, people or nation, in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of different cultural groups, and in American English racial, cultural or national minority group arises in the 1930s to 1940s,[6] serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. The abstract ethnicity had been used for paganism in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an ethnic character (first recorded 1953). The term ethnic group was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.[7] Depending on the context that is used, the term nationality may either be used synonymously with ethnicity, or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950.</p><p>Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In many cases – for instance, the sense of Jewish peoplehood&nbsp;– more than one aspect determines membership.</p><h2>Definitions and conceptual history[edit]</h2><p>Ethnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus in ca. 480 BC laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own ethnicity, which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating</p><li>shared descent (?µa?µ?? - homaimon, of the same blood),[8]</li><li>shared language (?µ????ss?? - homoglosson, speaking the same language)[9]</li><li>shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: ?e?? ?d??µat? te ????? ?a? ??s?a? - theon hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)[10]</li><li>shared customs (Greek: ??ea ?µ?t??pa - ethea homotropa, customs of like fashion).[11][12][13]</li><p>Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. According to Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality, in Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics and Reality&nbsp;: Proceedings of the Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, April 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, Department of Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993,[14] a conference organised by Statistics Canada and the United States Census Bureau (April 1–3, 1992).[15] Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16][irrelevant citation]</p><p>According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.</p><p>According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.[25]</p><p>Max Weber maintained that ethnic groups were künstlich (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called race.[26]</p><p>Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose Ethnic Groups and Boundaries from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s.[27] Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical a prioris to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: ...&nbsp;categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.</p><p>In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of ethnic groups in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>...&nbsp;the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed.[27]</p><p>In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as cultural or tribal when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that ethnicity had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning ethnic identity (like earlier claims concerning tribal identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.[27]</p><p>According to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:</p><p>[C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.[28]</p><p>Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.[29] Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness.[27] He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) Ethnicity&nbsp;... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.[27] This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.</p><h3>Approaches to understanding ethnicity[edit]</h3><p>Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. Examples of such approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.</p><p>Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16] Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.[36]</p><p>Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to boundary markers - characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.[37][38][39][40][41]</p><h3>Ethnicity theory[edit]</h3><p>Ethnicity theory says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification.[42] This theory was put forth by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of “culture”.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This theory was preceded by over a century where biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation of scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used was the measurement of cranial capacity.[43]</p><p>Ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture.</p><p>Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country.[44] While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process&nbsp;– contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation&nbsp;– it did so only for white ethnic communities.[44] The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact.</p><p>And assimilation&nbsp;– shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture&nbsp;– did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others.[44] Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities.[45] It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.[46] In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a “benign neglect” of social inequality.[46]</p><h2>Ethnicity and nationality[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Nation state and minority group</p><p>In some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner[47] and Benedict Anderson[48] see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of nation-states in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries. Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.</p><p>In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent nations. Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state.[49] Under these conditions&nbsp;– when people moved from one state to another,[50] or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries&nbsp;– ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Multi-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation state. Examples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, which were ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed multicultural societies especially in large cities.</p><p>The states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.</p><p>In recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis)[51] have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent.[52] It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviours that belong to a specific collectivity.[53] Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne.</p><h2>Ethnicity and race[edit]</h2><p>Race and ethnicity are considered to be related concepts. Ethnicity is often assumed to be somewhat more of a cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language and cultural tradition, while race is assumed to be strictly a biological classification, based on DNA and bone structure. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to its common political use. It is assumed that, based on power relations, there exist 'racialized ethnicities' and 'ethnicized races'. Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.[54]</p><p>Before Weber, race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity was predominant: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.[55] With Weber's introduction of the view of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.</p><p>In 1950, the UNESCO statement, The Race Question, signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), suggested that: National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'.[56]</p><p>In 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:</p><p>The opposing interests that divide the working classes are further reinforced through appeals to racial and ethnic distinctions. Such appeals serve to allocate different categories of workers to rungs on the scale of labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations to the lower levels and insulating the higher echelons from competition from below. Capitalism did not create all the distinctions of ethnicity and race that function to set off categories of workers from one another. It is, nevertheless, the process of labor mobilization under capitalism that imparts to these distinctions their effective values.[57]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.[58]</p><p>Writing about the usage of the term ethnic in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, in 1977 Wallman noted that</p><p>The term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' in Britain, only less precisely, and with a lighter value load. In North America, by contrast, '[race]' most commonly means color, and 'ethnics' are the descendants of relatively recent immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. '[Ethnic]' is not a noun in Britain. In effect there are no 'ethnics'; there are only 'ethnic relations'.[59]</p><p>In the U.S., the OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not scientific or anthropological and takes into account social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry, using appropriate scientific methodologies that are not primarily biological or genetic in reference.[60]</p><h2>Ethno-national conflict[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Ethnic conflict</p><p>Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like Jürgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.</p><p>The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.</p><h2>Ethnic groups by continent[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Africa</p><p>Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture.</p><p>Many ethnic groups and nations of Africa qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society. These mostly originate with the Sahelian kingdoms of the medieval period, such as that of the Akan, deriving from Bonoman (11th century) then the Kingdom of Ashanti (17th century).[61]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Asia</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Assyriankhigga.jpg/230px-Assyriankhigga.jpg" width="230" height="153"><br><p>The Assyrians are the indigenous peoples of Northern Iraq.</p><p>There is an abundance of ethnic groups throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical.

Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban. Some groups/countries of Asia are completely urban (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore). The colonization of Asia was largely ended in the 20th century, with national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.</p><h3>Europe[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Europe</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Olentzero%2C_Beasain.jpg/220px-Olentzero%2C_Beasain.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>The Basque people constitute an indigenous ethnic minority in both France and Spain.</p><p>Europe has a large number of ethnic groups; Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct peoples of Europe, of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities within every state they inhabit (although they may form local regional majorities within a sub-national entity).

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The term Danish Realm (Danish: Det Danske Rige[14][15]) refers to the relationship between Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland—three countries constituting the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>The legal nature of the Kingdom of Denmark is fundamentally one of a unitary sovereign state. The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been part of the Crown of Denmark since 1397 (de jure) when the Kalmar Union was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (de facto). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an extensive type of self-government and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields.[16]</p><p>Legal matters in The Danish Realm are subject to the Danish Constitution.[17] Beginning in 1953, state law issues within The Danish Realm has been governed by The Unity of the Realm (Danish: Rigsenheden).[18][19][20][21] A less formal name for The Unity of the Realm is the Commonwealth of the Realm.[13] In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as rigsfællesskabet. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both The Unity of The Realm and The Danish Realm itself has increasingly been referred to as simply rigsfællesskabet (Faroese: ríkisfelagsskapurin; Greenlandic: naalagaaffeqatigiit) in daily parlance.[18]</p><p>The Danish Constitution stipulates that the foreign and security interests for all parts of the Danish Realm are the responsibility of the Danish government. The Faroes received home rule in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received self rule, thus leaving the Danish government with virtually no influence over Greenlandic internal affairs.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Constitutionality[edit]</h2><p>The Danish Realm's unique state of internal affairs is acted out in the principle of The Unity of the Realm.[19] This principle is derived from Article 1 of the Danish Constitution which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.[22] The Constitutional Act specifies that sovereignty is to continue to be exclusively with the authorities of the Realm (the Danish government and parliament). Faroese or Greenlandic self-governance cannot be established by international treaties but must be established by Danish law; the Danish parliament (the Folketing) delegates a precisely defined part of its competence to the home rule authorities.[23]</p><p>The language of Denmark is Danish, and the Danish state authorities are based in Denmark. The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, Copenhagen. Two of the parliament's members are elected in each of Greenland and the Faroe Islands; the remaining 175 members are elected in Denmark. The Government ministries are located in Copenhagen, as is the highest court, the Supreme Court.[22]</p><h2>Devolved powers[edit]</h2><p>See also: Home rule, Politics of the Faroe Islands, and Politics of Greenland</p><p>In principle, the Danish Realm constitutes a unified sovereign state, with equal status between its constituent parts.[13] Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains de jure unitary.</p><p>The Self-Government Arrangements devolves political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and the Greenlandic political authorities. The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks. The Danish government provides an annual grant to the Faroese and the Greenlandic authorities to cover the costs of these devolved areas.[16]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Tinganes.jpg/220px-Tinganes.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Tinganes, in the capital Tórshavn, is the location of the Faroese Home Government.</p><p>The 1948 Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands sets out the terms of Faroese home rule. The Act states, ...the Faroe Islands shall constitute a self-governing community within the State of Denmark.[1] It establishes the home government of the Faroe Islands (Landsstýrið) and the Faroese parliament, the Løgting. More significantly, the Act specifies the powers devolved from the Government of Denmark, including: local government and municipal affairs; taxation, at a local and territorial level; public services, including police and town planning; welfare services, such as housing; primary and secondary education; Archives, libraries, museums; agriculture and fishing; entertainment; among other areas.[1] The Faroe Islands were previously administered as a Danish county (amt); the Home Rule Act abolished the post of Amtmand (County Governor) and replaced it with the role of Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner to the Danish government).[1] These powers were expanded in a 2005 Act, which named the Faroese home government as an equal partner with the Danish government.[24]</p><p>The 1978 Greenland Home Rule Act devolves powers in much the same way as the Faroese Home Rule Act. It sets out a home rule government and Greenlandic parliament. Specific areas of governance specified in the act include: Organization of local government; Fishing and agriculture; Welfare system; protection of the environment; other areas affecting Greenlanders directly, etc.[2]</p><p>On 21 June 2009, Greenland assumed self-determination with responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, natural resources, immigration and border controls. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[25] Greenland is now described as having self rule, with its home government exercising a wider range of powers.</p><p>There are a number of matters that can not be acquired by the territories; Constitutional affairs, foreign policy, defence, the Supreme Court, citizenship, and monetary policy. Additionally, the Faroese and Greenlandic parliaments are subordinate to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Denmark, where the two territories are represented by two seats each (from a total of 179 seats).</p><h2>Legal status[edit]</h2><p>The Faroe Islands and Greenland have two seats each (out of 179) in the Danish parliament, Folketinget[26] The arrangement between the areas of the Realm is sometimes described as constituent countries. Greenland's powers of self-government were increased in 2009 through the Greenland Self-Rule Act, which established the Greenlanders as a separate national people under international law, while the Faroe Islands have gradually taken control of more and more areas according to their Home Rule Act from 1948.[27] The Faroese/Danish act of 2005 states This law is based on an agreement between the Governments of the Faroe Islands and Denmark as equal partners.[28] Despite this principle of unity among the three territories, some commentators consider the Danish Realm as a federation or a sui generis legal construction. In the opinion of Bogi Eliasen, the Kingdom of Denmark is not a unitary state but a structure with some federative elements of divided power.[13] Danish justice Frederik Harhoff states that the Kingdom of Denmark is neither a federation (since it lacks a treaty to this effect), nor is it a confederation[13] But the home rules are limited to internal matters only. Greenland or the Faroe Islands cannot write laws which concern the relationship with other states, nor laws that applies to the entire Realm, and the Supreme Court (Danish: Højesteret) in Copenhagen is the final legal instance (and legal matters from Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be prepared for that court, like any Danish matter). Danish currency is also legal tender and Denmark is responsible for the military defense.[29] Further, for rare treatments and certain surgery, Greenlanders and Faraoses are often directed to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>International community[edit]</h3><p>See also: Foreign relations of Denmark</p><p>Previously, most foreign relations were undertaken by the Government of Denmark exclusively on behalf of the entire realm, but more recently the Faroe Islands and Greenland have increased their role in the foreign policy. Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the Thule Air Base in northwest Greenland.</p><p>The Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the OECD and the World Trade Organization. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the Nordic Council in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the European Union, both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but opted to leave in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.</p><p>The Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a national of Denmark and a resident of the Faroe Islands.[1] The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular Danish passport as well. The Faroese Home Rule Act states that, in Faroese passports, Føroyingur (Faroese) and Føroyar (Faroe Islands) shall be inserted after the words Dansk (Danish) and Danmark (Denmark).[1]</p><h2>Population and area[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Geography of Denmark, Geography of Greenland, and Geography of the Faroe Islands</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg/300px-Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg.png" width="300" height="213"><br><p>Comparison map: Greenland, the Faroe Islands (enlarged) and Denmark differ significantly in size. The Danish Realm is spread far apart, across the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea.</p><p>The size of the Danish population is far greater than the population size of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper has a population of about 5.6 million people, while the populations of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are 48,000 and 56,000 people, respectively. A medium-sized Danish provincial town has, for comparison, a population of about 50,000. With an area of over two million km² (836,109 square miles), Greenland is the most sparsely populated territory in the world.</p><p>The disparity between the small population of the former colonies and the greater population of Denmark proper has helped to enforce the hegemonial position that Denmark proper holds in the Realm. When the areas of the three territories are combined, the Kingdom of Denmark ranks as the twelfth largest country in the world, the same rank held by Greenland alone.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><p>Hjemmestyre
Meaning "home rule", it indicates an autonomous administration (present in both in Greenland and the Faroe Islands) that has power over all internal affairs. In this arrangement, the Danish government deals only with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with "self-governing."


Selvstyre
Following a referendum on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.[32] As a result of these changes Greenland was now said to have self rule with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to "home rule".


Rigsombudsmand
High Commissioners represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each country. He or she can attend the meetings at the Løgting in the Faroes and at the Inatsisartut in Greenland, but they can't vote.


Folketingsmedlemmer fra Færøerne og Grønland
Members of Folketing from the Faroe Islands and Greenland: Greenland and the Faroe Islands and their self-rule administrations take part in consultations on policies and decisions affecting their region, including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the Danish parliament (Folketing). They have two members each, and these are full members of the Danish Folketing and are allowed to vote.


Countries
Mirroring the terminology of the United Kingdom or the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Greenland, Denmark and the Faroes are sometimes referred to as countries within the sovereign state of the Kingdom of Denmark. However, such usage is inconsistent; whilst Denmark proper may be referred to as a country, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are officially referred to as "self-governing territories".[33] Additionally, the recent law granting Greenland "self rule" in 2008 refers to Greenland as "a people", but not a country.[34]</p><h2>Literature[edit]</h2><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><h2>Sources[edit]</h2><p>Find more aboutKingdom of Denmarkat Wikipedia's sister projects

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>A constitutional monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution.[1] Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.</p><p>A constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution, whether written or unwritten.[2] While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarch's name, in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets public policy or chooses political leaders. Political scientist Vernon Bogdanor, paraphrasing Thomas Macaulay, has defined a constitutional monarch as a sovereign who reigns but does not rule.[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In addition to acting as a visible symbol of national unity, a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as dissolving parliament or giving royal assent to legislation. However, the exercise of such powers is largely strictly in accordance with either written constitutional principles or unwritten constitutional conventions, rather than any personal political preference imposed by the sovereign. In The English Constitution, British political theorist Walter Bagehot identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch may freely exercise: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. Many constitutional monarchies still retain significant authorities or political influence however, such as through certain reserve powers, and may also play an important political role.</p><p>The United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms are all constitutional monarchies in the Westminster tradition of constitutional governance. Three states&nbsp;– Malaysia, Cambodia and the Holy See&nbsp;– are elective monarchies, wherein the ruler is periodically selected by a small electoral college.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The oldest constitutional monarchy dating back to ancient times was that of the Hittites. They were an ancient Anatolian people that lived during the Bronze Age whose king or queen had to share their authority with an assembly, called Panku, equivalent to a modern-day deliberative assembly of a legislature. These were scattered noble families that worked as representatives of their subjects in an adjutant or subaltern federal-type landscape.[4][5]</p><p>The most recent[update] country to move from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy was Bhutan, between 2007 and 2008 (see Politics of Bhutan, Constitution of Bhutan and Bhutanese democracy).</p><h2>Constitutional and absolute monarchy[edit]</h2><h3>England and the United Kingdom[edit]</h3><p>In the Kingdom of England, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, although limits on the power of the monarch ('a limited monarchy') are much older than that (see Magna Carta). At the same time, in Scotland the Convention of Estates enacted the Claim of Right Act 1689, which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy.</p><p>Although Queen Anne was the last monarch to veto an Act of Parliament when in 1707 she blocked the Scottish Militia Bill, Hanoverian monarchs continued to selectively dictate government policies. For instance George III constantly blocked Catholic Emancipation, eventually precipitating the resignation of William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister in 1801.[6] The sovereign's influence on the choice of Prime Minister gradually declined over this period, William IV being the last monarch to dismiss a Prime Minister, when in 1834 he removed Lord Melbourne as a result of Melbourne's choice of Lord John Russell as Leader of the House of Commons.[7][8] Queen Victoria was the last monarch to exercise real personal power but this diminished over the course of her reign. In 1839 she became the last sovereign to keep a Prime Minister in power against the will of Parliament when the Bedchamber crisis resulted in the retention of Lord Melbourne's administration.[9] By the end of her reign, however, she could do nothing to block the unacceptable (to her) premierships of William Gladstone, although she still exercised power in appointments to the Cabinet, for example in 1886 preventing Gladstone's choice of Hugh Childers as War Secretary in favor of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.[10]</p><p>Today, the role of the British monarch is by convention effectively ceremonial.[11] Instead, the British Parliament and the Government – chiefly in the office of Prime Minister – exercise their powers under 'Royal (or Crown) Prerogative': on behalf of the monarch and through powers still formally possessed by the Monarch.[12][13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>No person may accept significant public office without swearing an oath of allegiance to the Queen.[14] With few exceptions, the monarch is bound by constitutional convention to act on the advice of the Government.</p><h3>Continental Europe[edit]</h3><p>Constitutional monarchy originated in continental Europe, with Poland developing the first constitution for a monarchy with the Constitution of May 3, 1791; it was the third constitution in the world just after the first republican Constitution of the United States. Constitutional monarchy also occurred briefly in the early years of the French Revolution, but much more widely afterwards. Napoleon Bonaparte is considered the first monarch proclaiming himself as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, in his work Elements of the Philosophy of Right (1820), gave the concept a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law.[15] Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan.[16]</p><h2>Modern constitutional monarchy[edit]</h2><p>As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was head of the executive branch and quite a powerful figure even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have envisioned the president as an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was then understood, following Montesquieu's account of the separation of powers.[17]</p><p>The present-day concept of a constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the prime minister, exercise power, with the monarchs having ceded power and remaining as a titular position. In many cases the monarchs, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of servants of the people to reflect the new, egalitarian position. In the course of France's July Monarchy, Louis-Philippe I was styled King of the French rather than King of France.</p><p>Following the Unification of Germany, Otto von Bismarck rejected the British model. In the constitutional monarchy established under the Constitution of the German Empire which Bismarck inspired, the Kaiser retained considerable actual executive power, while the Imperial Chancellor needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Later, Fascist Italy could also be considered as a constitutional monarchy, in that there was a king as the titular head of state while actual power was held by Benito Mussolini under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.</p><p>Nowadays a parliamentary democracy that is a constitutional monarchy is considered to differ from one that is a republic only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected Members of Parliament.</p><p>However, three important factors distinguish monarchies such as the United Kingdom from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with Parliament. These are: the Royal Prerogative under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited circumstances; Sovereign Immunity under which the monarch may do no wrong under the law because the responsible government is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use restrictions as most citizens. Other privileges may be nominal or ceremonial (e.g., where the executive, judiciary, police or armed forces act on the authority of or owe allegiance to the Crown).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today slightly more than a quarter of constitutional monarchies are Western European countries, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Luxembourg, Monaco, Liechtenstein and Sweden. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In these countries the prime minister holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the monarch retains residual (but not always insignificant) powers. The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a coalition government following a parliamentary election, while in Norway the King chairs special meetings of the cabinet.</p><p>In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the Cabinet. Only a few monarchies (most notably Japan and Sweden) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.</p><p>There are sixteen constitutional monarchies under Queen Elizabeth II, which are known as Commonwealth realms.[18] Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant reserve or prerogative powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises, usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor-General exercising such power occurred during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills. On November 11, 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he sought the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition Malcolm Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether Australia should become a republic. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy, however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by the constitution, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.</p><p>In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The former King, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was the longest reigning monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history, prior to passing away on 13 October 2016.[19] Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in Thai Politics.) Among the powers retained by the monarch under the constitution, lèse majesté protects the image of the monarch and enables him to play a role in politics. It carries strict criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence arises from this reverence and from the socio-economic improvement efforts undertaken by the royal family.</p><p>In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a frequent debate centers on when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favor of a partisan goal, while some political scientists champion the idea of an interventionist monarch as a check against possible illegal action by politicians. For instance, the monarch of the United Kingdom can theoretically exercise an absolute veto over legislation by withholding royal assent. However, no monarch has done so since 1708, and it is widely believed that this and many of the monarch's other political powers are lapsed powers.</p><p>There are currently 44 monarchies, and most of them are constitutional monarchies.</p><h2>List of current constitutional monarchies[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

One of the animals found here is the polar bear, which is on the coat of arms of the Danish royal family in Greenland</p><p>The history of Greenland is a history of life under extreme Arctic conditions: currently, an ice cap covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.</p><p>The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental North America. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when Icelandic Vikings settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the Inuit Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around 1200 AD, from northwestern Greenland. While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the Little Ice Age, the early Norse settlements along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, Denmark-Norway, apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a colonial power, Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to paganism. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.</p><p>During World War II, when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the United States and Canada.[1] After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas amt (county). Although Greenland is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it has enjoyed home rule since 1979. In 1985, the island decided to leave the European Union, which it had joined as a part of Denmark in 1973; the Faroes had never joined.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early Paleo-Eskimo cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png/200px-Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png" width="200" height="764"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Arctic cultures in and around Greenland, 900-1500</p><p>The prehistory of Greenland is a story of repeated waves of Paleo-Eskimo immigration from the islands north of the North American mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of Siberia who migrated into Canada thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. Archaeology can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.</p><p>The earliest known cultures in Greenland are the Saqqaq culture (2500–800 BC) [2] and the Independence I culture in northern Greenland (2400–1300 BCE). The practitioners of these two cultures are thought to have descended from separate groups that came to Greenland from northern Canada.[3] Around 800 BCE, the so-called Independence II culture arose in the region where the Independence I culture had previously existed.[4] it was originally thought that Independence II was succeeded by Dorset culture (700 BC–200 AD), but some Independence II artefacts date from as recently as the 1st century BCE. Recent studies suggest that, in Greenland at least, the Dorset culture may be better understood as a continuation of Independence II culture; the two cultures have therefore been designated Greenlandic Dorset. Artefacts associated with early Dorset culture in Greenland have been found as far north as Inglefield Land on the west coast and the Dove Bugt area on the east coast.[5]</p><p>After the Early Dorset culture disappeared around 200 AD, the island was uninhabited for several centuries.[5] The next immigrants to arrive from Canada, perhaps as early as 800, settled the northwest part of the island, bringing with them the so-called Late Dorset culture, which survived until about 1300.[6] The Norse arrived and settled in the southern part of the island in 980.</p><h2>Norse settlement[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg/220px-I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg" width="220" height="138"><br><p>Summer in the Greenland coast circa year 1000
Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen (1841–1893)</p><p>Europeans became aware of Greenland's existence, probably in the early 10th century, when Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, sailing from Norway to Iceland, was blown off course by a storm, and happened to sight some islands off Greenland. During the 980s, explorers led by Erik the Red set out from Iceland and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and settled there. Erik named the island Greenland (Grœnland in Old Norse, Grænland in modern Icelandic, Grønland in modern Danish and Norwegian) in effect as a marketing device. Both the Book of Icelanders (Íslendingabók, a medieval account of Icelandic history from the 12th century onward) and the Saga of Eric the Red (Eiríks saga rauða, a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland) state He named the land Greenland, saying that people would be eager to go there if it had a good name.[7]</p><p>The Norse established their settlements along fjords (such as the Tunuliarfik and Aniaaq fjords in the central area of the Eastern settlement). Because this was during the so-called Medieval Warm Period, the vegetation there was very different from what it is today. Excavations have shown that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4 to 6 metre tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush.[8][unreliable source?][9][unreliable source?] The Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for three years for committing murder.[10] He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.[11] This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at Brattahlid (now Qassiarsuk), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, Leif Eirikson, left the settlement to explore the regions around Vinland, which is generally assumed to have been located in what is now Newfoundland.</p><p>The Norse settled in three separate locations: the larger Eastern settlement, the smaller Western settlement, and the still smaller Middle Settlement (often considered part of the Eastern one). The settlements at their height are estimated to have had a population of between 2,000 and 10,000 people, with more recent estimates[12] tending toward the lower figure. Ruins of approximately 620 farms have been identified: 500 in the Eastern settlement, 95 in the Western settlement, and 20 in the Middle. The settlements carried on a trade in ivory from walrus tusks with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides according to one 13th-century account. They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal Labrador), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late 13th century, all ships from Greenland were required by law to sail directly to Norway. The climate also became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the Little Ice Age.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Hvalsey_Church.jpg/200px-Hvalsey_Church.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Hvalsey Church</p><p>In 1126, a diocese was founded at Garðar (now Igaliku). It was subject to the Norwegian archdiocese of Nidaros (now Trondheim); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261, the population accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King as well, although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements declined in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350. In 1378, there was no longer a bishop at Garðar. The last written record of the Norse Greenlanders is of a marriage, in 1408, in Hvalsey Church, which still stands today; although in ruins, it is the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.</p><p>After 1408 not many written records mention the settlers. There is correspondence between the Pope and the Biskop Bertold af Garde from the same year.[13] The Danish Cartographer Claudius Clavus seems to have visited Greenland in 1420, according to documents written by Nicolas Germanus and Henricus Martellus who had access to original cartographic notes and a map by Clavus. Two mathematical manuscripts containing the second chart of the Claudius Clavus map from his journey to Greenland, where he himself mapped the area, were found during the late 20th century by the Danish scholar Bjönbo and Petersen.[14]</p><p>In a letter dated 1448 from Rome, Pope Nicholas V prescribed the bishops of Skálholt and Hólar (the two Icelandic episcopal sees) to ensure to provide the inhabitants of Greenland with priests and a bishop, the latter of which they hadn't had in the 30 years since the apparent coming of the heathens when most churches were destroyed and the people taken away as prisoners.[15]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the middle of the 15th century although no exact date has been established.</p><h2>Norse failure[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Grtemp.png" width="355" height="173"><p>A graphical description of changes in temperature in Greenland from 500&nbsp;– 1990 based on analysis of the deep ice core from Greenland and some historical events.

Among the factors that have been suggested as contributing to the demise of the Greenland colony are:[16][17]</p><p>Numerous studies have tested these hypotheses and some have led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.[citation needed] The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.[18]</p><p>Greenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation.[19] A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food.[19] But they never learned to use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.[19]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>To investigate the possibility of climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples. The oxygen isotopes from the ice caps suggested that the Medieval Warm Period had caused a relatively milder climate in Greenland, lasting from roughly 800 to 1200. However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, the Little Ice Age had reached intense levels in Greenland.[20] Excavations of middens from the Viking farms in both Greenland and Iceland show the shift from the bones of cows and pigs to those of sheep and goats. As the winters lengthened, and the springs and summers shortened, there must have been less and less time for Greenlanders to grow hay. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century—as much as 6-8&nbsp;°C lower than modern summer temperatures.[21] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. By the mid-14th century deposits from a chieftain’s farm showed a large number of cattle and caribou remains, whereas, a poorer farm only several kilometers away had no trace of domestic animal remains, only seal. Bone samples from Greenland Norse cemeteries confirm that the typical Greenlander diet had increased by this time from 20% sea animals to 80%.[22]</p><p>Although Greenland seems to have been uninhabited at the time of initial Norse settlement, the Thule people migrated south and finally came into contact with the Norse in the 12th century. There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as skræling. The Icelandic Annals are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.[23] Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference—an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them—or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.[citation needed]</p><p>The Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of kayak navigation or ring seal hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement. By 1350, the Norse had completely deserted their Western Settlement.[24] The Inuit, being a hunting society, may have hunted the Norse livestock, forcing the Norse into conflict or abandonment of their settlements.[citation needed]</p><p>In mild weather conditions, a ship could make the 900-mile (1400 kilometers) trip from Iceland to Eastern Settlement within a couple of weeks. Greenlanders had to keep in contact with Iceland and Norway in order to trade. Little is known about any distinctive shipbuilding techniques among the Greenlanders. Greenland lacks a supply of lumber, so was completely dependent on Icelandic merchants or, possibly, logging expeditions to the Canadian coast.[citation needed]</p><p>The sagas mention Icelanders traveling to Greenland to trade.[25] Settlement chieftains and large farm owners controlled this trade. Chieftains would trade with the foreign ships and then disperse the goods by trading with the surrounding farmers.[26] The Greenlanders' main commodity was the walrus tusk,[16] which was used primarily in Europe as a substitute for elephant ivory for art décor, whose trade had been blocked by conflict with the Islamic world. Professor Gudmundsson suggests a very valuable narwhal tusk trade, through a smuggling route between western Iceland and the Orkney islands.[citation needed]</p><p>It has been argued that the royal Norwegian monopoly on shipping contributed to the end of trade and contact. However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the Herjolfsnes church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding. Most had crucifixes around their necks with their arms crossed as in a stance of prayer. Roman papal records report that the Greenlanders were excused from paying their tithes in 1345 because the colony was suffering from poverty.[27] The last reported ship to reach Greenland was a private ship that was blown off course, reaching Greenland in 1406, and departing in 1410 with the last news of Greenland: the burning at the stake of a condemned witch, the insanity and death of the woman this witch was accused of attempting to seduce through witchcraft, and the marriage of the ship's captain, Thorsteinn Ólafsson, to another Icelander, Sigridur Björnsdóttir.[28] However, there are some suggestions of much later unreported voyages from Europe to Greenland, possibly as late as the 1480s.[29] In the mid-1500s, a German ship drifted off-course to Greenland and, coming ashore a small island, discovered the body of a dead man lying face down who demonstrated cultural traits of both Norse and Inuit. An Icelandic crew member of the ship wrote: He had a hood on his head, well sewn, and clothes from both homespun and sealskin. At his side lay a carving knife bent and worn down by whetting. This knife they took with them for display.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to a 2009 study, there is no evidence for perceptible contact between Iceland and Greenland after the mid fifteenth century... It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years. Presumably, the archbishop had better archives at his disposal than most people, and yet he had not heard that the Greenlanders were gone.[18]</p><p>One intriguing fact is that very few fish remains are found among their middens. This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, and may have been disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied more and more of the diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.[31]</p><p>One Inuit story recorded in the 18th century tells that raiding expeditions by European ships over the course of three years destroyed the settlement, after which many of the Norse sailed away south and the Inuit took in some of the remaining women and children before the final attack.[11]</p><h2>Late Dorset and Thule cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png/220px-ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png" width="220" height="286"><br><p>The Thule were skilled whalers, as depicted here by Norwegian missionary Hans Egede in the 18th century.</p><p>The Norse may not have been alone on the island when they arrived; a new influx of Arctic people from the west, the Late Dorset culture, may predate them.[6] However, this culture was limited to the extreme northwest of Greenland, far from the Norse who lived around the southern coasts. Some archaeological evidence may point to this culture slightly predating the Norse settlement. It disappeared around 1300, around the same time as the westernmost of the Norse settlements disappeared. In the region of this culture, there is archaeological evidence of gathering sites for around four to thirty families, living together for a short time during their movement cycle.</p><p>Around 1200, another Arctic culture, the Thule, arrived from the west, having emerged 200 years earlier in Alaska. They settled south of the Late Dorset culture and ranged over vast areas of Greenland's west and east coasts. These people, the ancestors of the modern Inuit, were flexible and engaged in the hunting of almost all animals on land and in the ocean, including big whales. They had dogs, which the Dorset did not, and used them to pull the dog sledges; they also used bows and arrows, contrary to the Dorset. Increasingly settled, they had large food storages to avoid winter famine. The early Thule avoided the highest latitudes, which only became populated again after renewed immigration from Canada in the 19th century.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The nature of the contacts between the Thule, Dorset and Norse cultures is not clear, but may have included trade elements. The level of contact is currently the subject of widespread debate, possibly including Norse trade with Thule or Dorsets in Canada or possible scavenging of abandoned Norse sites (see also Maine penny). No Norse trade goods are known in Dorset archaeological sites in Greenland; the only Norse items found have been characterized as exotic items. Carved screw threads on tools and carvings with beards found in settlements on the Canadian Arctic islands show contact with the Norse. Some stories tell of armed conflicts between, and kidnappings by, both Inuit and Norse groups. The Inuit may have reduced Norse food sources by displacing them on hunting grounds along the central west coast. These conflicts can be one contributing factor to the disappearance of the Norse culture as well as for the Late Dorset, but few see it as the main reason.</p><h2>Danish recolonization[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish colonization of Greenland</p><p>Most of the old Norse records concerning Greenland were removed from Trondheim to Copenhagen in 1664 and subsequently lost, probably in the 1728 fire there.[32] The precise rediscovery is uncertain because south-drifting icebergs during the Little Ice Age long made the eastern coast unreachable, leading to general confusion between Baffin Island, Greenland, and Spitsbergen as seen, for example, in the difficulty locating the Frobisher Strait, which was not confirmed to be a bay until 1861. Nonetheless, interest in discovering a Northwest Passage to Asia led to repeated expeditions in the area, though none were successful until Roald Amundsen in 1906 and even that success involved his being iced in for two years. Christian I of Denmark purportedly sent an expedition to the region under Pothorst and Pining to Greenland in 1472 or 1473; Henry VII of England sent another under Cabot in 1497 and 1498; Manuel I of Portugal sent a third under Corte-Real in 1500 and 1501. It had certainly been generally charted by the 1502 Cantino map, which includes the southern coastline.[32] The island was rediscovered yet again by Martin Frobisher in 1578, prompting the Danish king Frederick II to outfit a new expedition of his own the next year under the Englishman James Alday; this proved a costly failure.[32] The influence of English and Dutch whalers became so pronounced that for a time the western shore of the island itself became known as Davis Strait (Dutch: Straat Davis) after John Davis's 1585 and 1586 expeditions, which charted the western coast as far north as Disko Bay.[33]</p><p>Meanwhile, following Sweden's exit from the Kalmar Union, the remaining states in the personal union were reorganized into Denmark-Norway in 1536. In protest against foreign involvement in the region, the Greenlandic polar bear was included in the state's coat of arms in the 1660s (It was removed in 1958). In the second half of the 17th century Dutch, German, French, Basque, and Dano-Norwegian ships hunted bowhead whales in the pack ice off the east coast of Greenland, regularly coming to shore to trade and replenish drinking water. Foreign trade was later forbidden by Danish monopoly merchants.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Old_Greenland_1747.jpg/220px-Old_Greenland_1747.jpg" width="220" height="140"><br><p>A 1747 map based on Egede's descriptions, including many geographical errors common to the time.</p><p>From 1711 to 1721,[34] the Norwegian cleric Hans Egede petitioned King Frederick IV for funding to travel to Greenland and re-establish contact with the Norse settlers there. Presumably, such settlers would still be Catholic or even pagan and he desired to establish a mission among them to spread the Reformation.[35] Frederick permitted Egede and some Norwegian merchants to establish the Bergen Greenland Company to revive trade with the island but refused to grant them a monopoly over it for fear of antagonizing Dutch whalers in the area.[36] The Royal Mission College assumed superintendency over the mission and provided the company with a small stipend. Egede found but misidentified the ruins of the Norse colony, went bankrupt amid repeated attacks by the Dutch, and found lasting conversion of the migrant Inuit exceedingly difficult. An attempt to found a royal colony under Major Claus Paarss established the settlement of Godthåb (Good Hope) in 1728 but was a costly debacle which saw most of his soldiers mutiny[35] and his settlers killed by scurvy.[37] Two child converts sent to Copenhagen for the coronation of Christian VI returned in 1733 with smallpox, devastating the island. The same ship that returned them, however, also brought the first Moravian missionaries, who in time would convert a former angekok (Inuit shaman), experience a revival at their mission of New Herrnhut, and establish a string of mission houses along the southwest coast. Around the same time, the merchant Jacob Severin took over administration of the colony and its trade and, having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son Poul. Both of them had studied the Kalaallisut language extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College such as Otto Fabricius began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.[34]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden at the 1814 Treaty of Kiel. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like William Scoresby and Greenland-born Knud Rasmussen. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first Greenlandic-language journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.[38] During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from British North America to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the Northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 Lakagígar eruption in Iceland.</p><p>Democratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862–1863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by Fridtjof Nansen accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64°N latitude.[39] In 1911, two Landstings were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in Copenhagen, where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the status quo, as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.</p><p>By 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially Hans Egede (1686 – 1758), a Lutheran missionary called the Apostle of Greenland. He founded Greenland's capital Godthåb, now known as Nuuk. His grandson Hans Egede Saabye (1746 – 1817) continued the missionary activities.[40]</p><h2>Polar exploration[edit]</h2><p>At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including Robert Peary, explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.</p><h2>Strategic importance[edit]</h2><p>See also: History of Greenland during World War II</p><p>After Norway regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian whaler Hallvard Devold occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as Erik the Red's Land. Two years later, the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled in favor of Denmark.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/ThuleAirBase.jpg/220px-ThuleAirBase.jpg" width="220" height="70"><br><p>The Thule Air Base, established after World War II, is the northernmost base of the US Air Force</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>World War II[edit]</h3><p>During World War II, when Nazi Germany extended its war operations to Greenland, Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish Minister to the United States&nbsp;— who had already refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark&nbsp;— signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting the US Armed Forces permission to establish stations in Greenland.[41] Kauffmann did this without the knowledge of the Danish government, and consequently, the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately – none of which had any result.[41] Because of the difficulties for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful export, especially of cryolite, Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status. Its supplies were guaranteed by the United States and Canada.</p><p>One Dane was killed in combat with Germans in Greenland.[41]</p><h3>Cold War[edit]</h3><p>During the Cold War, Greenland had a strategic importance, controlling parts of the passage between the Soviet Arctic harbours and the Atlantic, as well as being a good base for observing any use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, typically planned to pass over the Arctic. The United States therefore had a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100,000,000 but Denmark did not agree to sell.[42][43] In 1951, the Kauffman treaty was replaced by another one. The Thule Air Base at Thule (now Qaanaaq) in the northwest was made a permanent air force base. In 1953, some Inuit families were forced by Denmark to move from their homes to provide space for extension of the base. For this reason, the base has been a source of friction between the Danish government and the Greenlandic people. Tensions mounted when, on January 21, 1968, there was a nuclear accident&nbsp;— a B-52 Stratofortress carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed near the base, contaminating the area with radioactive debris. Although most of the contaminated ice was cleaned up, controversy currently surrounds recently declassified information indicating that one of the bombs was not accounted for. A 1995 Danish parliamentary scandal, dubbed Thulegate, highlighted that nuclear weapons were routinely present in Greenland's airspace in the years leading up to the accident, and that Denmark had tacitly given the go-ahead for this activity despite its official nuclear free policy.</p><p>Another recent controversy surrounds the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), which the United States Air Force upgraded in recent years to a phased array radar.[44] Opponents argue that the system presents a threat to the local population, as it would be targeted in the event of nuclear war.</p><h2>Home rule[edit]</h2><p>See also: Greenlandic independence</p><p>From 1948 to 1950, the Greenland Commission studied the conditions on the island, seeking to address its isolation, unequal laws, and economic stagnation. In the end, the Royal Greenland Trading Department's monopolies were finally removed. In 1953, Greenland was raised from the status of colony to that of an autonomous province or constituent country of the Danish Realm. Greenland was also assigned its own Danish county. Despite its small population, it was provided nominal representation in the Danish Folketing.</p><p>A plantation of exotic arctic trees was created in 1954 near Narsarsuaq.[45]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg/222px-Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg" width="222" height="148"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Blok P, the largest building in Greenland and formerly home to about 1% of its population, was demolished on October 19, 2012.</p><p>Denmark also began a number of reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their dependence on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.[46] Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.</p><p>Greenland's minimal representation in the Folketing meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The Folketing approved devolution in 1978 and the next year enacted home rule under a local Landsting. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985.</p><p>Greenland Home Rule has become increasingly Greenlandized, rejecting Danish and avoiding regional dialects to standardize the country under the language and culture of the Kalaallit (West Greenland Inuit). The capital Godthåb was renamed Nuuk in 1979; a local flag was adopted in 1985; the Danish KGH became the locally administered Kalaallit Niuerfiat (now KNI A/S) in 1986. Following a successful referendum on self-government in 2008, the local parliament's powers were expanded and Danish was removed as an official language in 2009.</p><p>International relations are now largely, but not entirely, also left to the discretion of the home rule government. After leaving the EEC, Greenland signed a special treaty with it,[when?] granting it special access to the market as a constituent country of Denmark, which remains a member. Greenland is also a member of several small organizations[which?] along with Iceland, the Faroes, and the Inuit populations of Canada and Russia.[citation needed] It was one of the founders of the environmental Arctic Council in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 US–Denmark treaty by the Home Rule government. The 1999–2003 Commission on Self-Governance even proposed that Greenland should aim at Thule Air Base's removal from American authority and operation under the aegis of the United Nations.[47]</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

								&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Amt (administrative division))
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Amt is a type of administrative division governing a group of municipalities, today only in Germany, but formerly also common in other countries of Northern Europe.[1] Its size and functions differ by country and the term is roughly equivalent to a US township or county or English shire district.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Current usage[edit]</h2><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>Prevalence[edit]</p><p>The Amt (plural: Ämter) is unique to the German Bundesländer (federal states) of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.</p><p>Other German states had this subdivision in the past. Some states have similar administrative units called Samtgemeinde (Lower Saxony), Verbandsgemeinde (Rhineland-Palatinate) or Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia).</p><p>Definition[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An Amt, as well as the other above-mentioned units, is subordinate to a Kreis (district) and is a collection of municipalities. The amt is lower than district-level government but higher than municipal government, and may be described as a supra-municipality or municipal confederation. Normally, it consists of very small municipalities (Gemeinden, plural of Gemeinde).</p><p>Larger municipalities do not belong to an Amt and are called amtsfreie Gemeinden (independent municipalities); some of these municipalities may also not depend from a Kreis (district) and are called kreisfreie Gemeinden, and when they do also not belong to any other Land they are also called Stadtstaaten (plural of Stadtstaat), i.e. city-states (Berlin and Hamburg).</p><p>These large municipalities (cities, in German Städte, plural of Stadt) may be further subdivided into local offices named Ortsämter (plural of Ortsamt), each of them possibly grouping several suburbs (or small townships in rural areas) of the municipality named Ortsteile (plural of Ortsteil), named from small villages or hamlets or localities. The Ortsteil (suburb or township) may have been a former parish, but today it is meant only for civil purpose and essentially used for planning within the municipality; the Ortsamt (sometimes just named informally but confusingly as an Amt, or informally translated as an urban district) is used to offer decentralized services of the municipality within local administrative offices for the residents in neighbouring suburbs. The Ortsteil itself may also be confusingly translated as a municipality, but it is incorrect because it belongs to a city which is the only effective municipality (Gemeinde).</p><h2>Former usage[edit]</h2><h3>Denmark[edit]</h3><p>The amt (plural, amter; commonly translated as county) was an administrative unit of Denmark (and, historically, of Denmark-Norway). The counties were established by royal decree in 1662 as replacements for the former Len (fiefs). The amter were originally composed of independent towns (købstæder) and parishes, and held only small areas of responsibility. During the 20th century, they were granted responsibility for the hospital service for the non-urban population. A 1970 administrative reform reduced the number of counties to fourteen and eliminated the administrative distinction between (rural) parish and town. From then on, the amter were composed of a number of municipalities (kommuner). The reform granted the counties wider areas of responsibility, most notably running the national health service and the gymnasium secondary schools.</p><p>The Danish Municipal Reform of January 1, 2007 abolished the amter and replaced them with five administrative regions, now solely charged with running the national health service. In contrast to the amter the regions hold no authority to levy taxes. The reform re-delegated all other areas of responsibility to either the municipalities or the state. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98. See Counties of Denmark for more information about the Danish usage of the term.</p><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>In Germany an Amt was a medieval administrative district covering a manorial estate or the land owned by a castle or village. It was headed by an Amtmann, usually a lesser nobleman or cleric, appointed by a territorial lord to administer and dispense justice within the Amt.</p><h3>Netherlands and Flanders[edit]</h3><p>Ambacht can be seen as the Dutch equivalent to amt. Ambachten existed in Holland, Zeeland and Flanders up to about 1800.</p><h3>Iceland[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While Iceland was a territory of the Danish realm, amts (singular: amt; plural: ömt) were established in the country on top of the existing counties. From 1684 to 1770, Iceland as whole was a single amt in the Kingdom of Denmark but was then split into two amts: North and East Amt (Norður- og Austuramt) and South and West Amt (Suður- og Vesturamt). The latter was in 1787 split into a West Amt (Vesturamt) and South Amt (Suðuramt). Iceland was thus divided into three amts until 1872, when the South and West amts were again merged. Amts were abolished in 1904, when Iceland gained home rule from Denmark.</p><p>Amts are not used to denote a geographical region in Iceland but the name lives on in the names of two public libraries in Iceland that were established during the amt era. The Amts libraries in Akureyri and Stykkishólmur which were established as the designated archives for the North and East Amt and the West Amt respectively.</p><h3>Norway[edit]</h3><p>From 1662 to 1919, the counties of Norway were called amter. They are now referred to as fylker, a term revived from the Middle Ages.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

In the 10th century, King Harald Bluetooth became a Christian and began organizing the church, and by the 11th century, Christianity was largely accepted throughout the country. Since the Reformation in Denmark, the Church has been Evangelical Lutheran, while retaining much of its pre-Reformation liturgical traditions. The 1849 Constitution of Denmark designated the church the Danish people's church and mandates that the state support it as such.[7]</p><p>The Church of Denmark continues to maintain the historical episcopate. Theological authority is vested in bishops: ten bishops in mainland Denmark and one in Greenland, each overseeing a diocese. There is no archbishop; the Bishop of Copenhagen acts as a primus inter pares.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Organization[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Peter_Skov-Jakobsen.jpg/170px-Peter_Skov-Jakobsen.jpg" width="170" height="220"><br><p>Peter Skov-Jakobsen, current Bishop of Copenhagen since 2009</p><h3>Dioceses[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark is organized in eleven dioceses, each led by a bishop, including one for Greenland (the Faroe Islands was a twelfth diocese until 29 July 2007). There are no archbishops; the most senior bishop (primus inter pares) is the Bishop of Copenhagen, currently Peter Skov-Jakobsen. The further subdivision includes 111 deaneries and 2,200 parishes. There are about 2,400 vicars.[citation needed]</p><h3>Parishes[edit]</h3><p>Each parish has a parochial council, elected by church members in four-year terms. The parochial council leads the practical business of the local church and decides employment of personnel, including the vicar(s). The vicar is subordinate to the council, except in spiritual matters such as conducting church services and pastoral care. Both parochial councils and vicars are, however, subordinate to bishops.</p><p>Voluntary congregations[edit]</p><p>A special feature is the possibility of creating voluntary congregations (valgmenighed) within the Church. These account for a few percent of church members. They are voluntary associations, electing their own parochial council and vicar, whom they agree to pay from their own pockets. In return, they are exempt from church tax. The voluntary congregation and its vicar are subordinate to bishops, and members remain full members of the Church. Historically, when a parish was dominated by a conservative majority and rector, the liberal minority would often set up a voluntary congregation with their own rector - and vice versa. Today the voluntary congregations are often a solution for people who find the idea of a free church appealing, but wish to keep some bonds to the church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Parish optionality[edit]</p><p>Another, less commonly used feature is parish optionality (sognebåndsløsning, literally parish bond release). If a Church member is dissatisfied with the particular vicar of his residence parish, he may choose to be served by another vicar who matches better with his Christian views, for example in a neighbouring parish.</p><h3>Membership[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Religion in Denmark</p><p>According to official statistics from January 2017, 75.9% of Danes are members of the Church of Denmark.[5] Membership rates vary from 58.1% in the Diocese of Copenhagen to 85.2% in the Diocese of Viborg. In recent years, the percentage of Danes that are members of the church has been slowly declining, the most important reasons being immigration from non-Lutheran countries, withdrawal of some members, and a somewhat lower rate (61.5%) of Danish infants being christened.[9]</p><p>Any person who is baptised (usually infant baptism) into the Church of Denmark automatically becomes a member. Members may renounce their membership and later return if they wish. Excommunication is legally possible but an extraordinarily rare occurrence. Examples include declared Satanists. A church member supporting reincarnation was excommunicated, but the Supreme Court overturned the excommunication in 2005.</p><h3>Faith and church attendance[edit]</h3><p>According to the latest inquiry about 2.4% [10] of church members attend services every week, although on Christmas Eve more than a third of the population attend. However, the church is still widely used for traditional family ceremonies including christenings and confirmations. In the year 2015, 33.8% of weddings[11][2] and 83.7% funerals were performed in the Church of Denmark,[12] and 71% of adolescents in grade 7–8 were confirmed.[13] The level of weekly church attendance is similar to that in Norway and Sweden.</p><p>According to a 2009 poll, 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the Son of God, and 18% believe he is the saviour of the world.[14]</p><h2>Doctrine[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG/220px-Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG" width="220" height="331"><br><p>Communion table and baptismal font in Besser Church, Samsø</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The church is aimed at having a wide acceptance of theological views, as long as they agree with the official symbolic books as stipulated in the Danish Code of 1683. These are:</p><p>Revised versions of the Old and New Testament were authorised by the Queen in 1992. A revised Hymn Book was authorised in 2003. Both the Bible translations and the Hymn Book implied widespread public and theological debate.</p><p>Historically, there is a contrast between a liberal current inspired by N. F. S. Grundtvig and more strict, pietist or Bible fundamentalist movements (such as Indre Mission). These tensions have sometimes threatened to divide the Church. Tidehverv is a minor fraction based on a strict Lutheranism and anti-modern, national-conservative views.[15][16]</p><p>The Church of Denmark is member of the Porvoo Communion between Lutheran and Anglican Churches.</p><h3>Liturgy[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Konfirmander.jpg/220px-Konfirmander.jpg" width="220" height="308"><br><p>Children preparing to be confirmed and become members of the church</p><p>The Communion Service includes three readings from the Bible: a chapter from one of the Gospels, from one of the Epistles or another part of the New Testament and, since 1992, from the Old Testament. Texts are picked from an official list following the church year. Some liturgical features have a fixed content but are free to the form. This accounts for the Common Prayer following the sermon, where the priest is obliged to mention the royal house. Some will simply mention the Queen and all her House whereas others will list all members of the royal house by name and title.</p><p>The sermon, as in other Protestant churches, is a central part of the service. The priest takes a starting point in the text of that Sunday, but is free to form a personal message of it. At special occasions, even non-priests may be allowed to preach. Hymns are also very central. In contrast to Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, Danish congregations sit while singing and stand while listening to Bible readings.</p><p>As in other Lutheran churches, the Church of Denmark recognizes only two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. These are usually included in the Communion Service. Formerly, individual or shared confession was a condition to receive the Lord's Supper. An official confession ritual still exists, but is now used very rarely. There are also official rituals for confirmation, wedding, blessing of a civil wedding and funerals. Emergency baptism may be performed by any Christian if necessary, and later the child will then be produced in Church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Church and state[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg/220px-Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>The Church of Our Lady, the cathedral of Copenhagen and the National Cathedral of Denmark</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg/220px-RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg" width="220" height="305"><br><p>Roskilde Cathedral has been the burial place of Danish royalty since the 15th century.

This applies to the royal princes and princesses as well, but does not apply to their spouses. Traditionally, though, every foreigner who has become a member of the royal family has converted or become a member of the church; as a result, the Prince Consort Henrik converted from Catholicism before marrying the Queen in 1968, and Mary Donaldson also converted from Presbyterianism before marrying Crown Prince Frederik in 2004.</p><h3>Freedom of religion[edit]</h3><p>With the Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Lutheran Christianity was established as the state religion. For the next century, in a time when religious wars swept Europe, harsh persecution of other faiths followed (Lutheran orthodoxy). Exceptions were granted only to foreign diplomats. For at least a period in the 16th century, small circles of clandestine Catholicism prevailed. From 1683, Roman Catholic, Reformed and Jewish congregations were allowed in the new town of Fredericia, the latter two also in Copenhagen. Non-Lutherans were also allowed in Friedrichstadt and on Nordstrand in Slesvig and in Glückstadt in Holstein. With the constitution of 1849, freedom of religion was introduced in Denmark, but Lutheranism remained the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Recognised and approved religions[edit]</p><p>A religious community does not need any state approval in order to enjoy the freedom of religion granted by the constitution. However, state-approved congregations (godkendte trossamfund) enjoy several privileges. They may conduct legal weddings, establish own cemeteries, get residence permits for foreign priests, are exempt from corporate and property tax, may apply for means from the state lottery fund, and members may tax-deduct membership fees and presents to the congregation.</p><p>Additionally, those congregations recognised by royal decree before 1970 (anerkendte trossamfund) may name and baptize children with legal effect, keep their own church registers and transcribe certificates on the basis of such registers.[6]</p><p>This legal distinction between recognised and approved communities remains, but is mainly a historical one. Communities recognised before 1970 includes only eight well-established Christian communities as well as one Jewish community. From 1970 until the 1990s only a few more Christian congregations were approved, but since 1998, a much more liberal practice has ensued. Since then, a board of independent experts decide about approval of new religious communities. The board includes professors of law, religious studies and theology and works under the Ministry of Justice, deliberately separate from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical affairs. It merely investigates whether the organisation fulfills basic definitions, such as having a doctrine, creed and cult, in order to be called a congregation of faith. In 2003, the approval of the Forn Sed religion caused some public debate.</p><h3>Lack of central authority[edit]</h3><p>The Church is in practice barred from having official positions in political or other matters, since it has no central bodies that could define such stances: nor a spiritual leader (such as an archbishop), nor a central assembly or synod. Bishops have the last say on doctrinal questions within their respective dioceses. The Queen (in practice the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Parliament are the central bodies, but they usually keep to administrative matters and abstain from interfering with spiritual questions. Church laws are rarely changed, and, when it happens, only administrative matters are affected.</p><p>Firstly, these principles are generally believed to ensure a non-sectarian, tolerant church where parishioners and priests enjoy a high degree of freedom to practise their own interpretation of Lutheran Christianity. Secondly, many Danish politicians and theologians claim that only this church-state-model will ensure the division of politics and religion, since the Church cannot interfere with political matters or even claim to speak with one voice on behalf of its members. They frequently discourage the term state church and argue it is, as its name states, the people's church.</p><p>Article 66 of the Danish Constitution stipulates a church ordinance shall be laid down by law. This promissory clause dates back from the first Constitution of 1849 but was never put into practice. It was feared that splits could occur if a central authority were created.</p><p>In very few cases have politicians deviated from their traditional hands-off course in church doctrinal matters. Where they have done so, it has been with the declared aim of preventing a possible split in the church. See the issues of Female clergy and Same-sex marriage above.</p><h3>Civil registration[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark conducts civil registration of births, deaths, change of name etc. (vital records). The keeping of such kirkebøger (church books) is a centuries-long tradition, dating from when the parish rectors were the only government representatives in rural areas. In 2002-03 the traditional church records were replaced by a new national electronic registration system called Personregistrering. After protests in 2005, the Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder announced that people who for various reasons did not want to send their registration forms (e.g. births and namings) to the local church office could now send their forms to a central office located in Nykøbing Falster.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 2010 parents' duty to report the birth of their child was abolished. Instead, it was decided that in the future it was the task of the midwives to report all births in Denmark (only when a midwife isn't present at the birth of a child are the parents still obliged to report the birth of the child).</p><p>From 1 December 2014 all applications should be submitted in digital form whenever possible.</p><h3>Economic support[edit]</h3><p>§4 in the Constitution of Denmark stipulates that The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17] On the other hand, §68 ensures that citizens are not obliged to pay personal contributions to any religion other than their own.[17] It has been questioned how these two principles can co-exist. Non-members do not pay church tax, but an additional state subsidiary accounts for 12% of the Church's income. This means every citizen, even a non-member, contributes with an average of 130 kroner annually (US$23). In addition, the bishops are high-ranking officials whose salary is fully paid by the state. In return, certain public tasks are carried out by the Church, such as conducting vital records registries and managing graveyards which are open to all denominations.</p><h3>Separation of church and state[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Kierkegaard.jpg/170px-Kierkegaard.jpg" width="170" height="252"><br><p>The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard was an outspoken advocate of separation of church and state[18]</p><p>The debate about separation of church and state emerges occasionally in Denmark. The current arrangement is supported by most political parties. It has been challenged for decades by the left wing and by atheists; more recently also by some ideological liberals and some members of free churches.</p><p>Proponents for a separation (disestablishment) argue the state church violates equality of religions and the principle of the secular state. Proponents for the current system argue that membership is voluntary, that the existence of a state church has ancient historical roots, and that the church fulfils certain administrative tasks for the state. They also argue it would be difficult to decide whether church-owned real estate should be handed over to the state or not. The former possessions of the Catholic Church were ceded to the Crown at the reformation in 1536.</p><p>According to a poll conducted by the free daily MetroXpress in April 2007, 52% wished to split church and state, 30% were against, and 18% undecided. Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, spoke out against a split: Church and state will be separated when more than half of the population are no longer members. N. F. S. Grundtvig said so, and I support that. The opposition Social Democrats also argued against a split, but said there should be more equality between denominations, possibly by a state subsidiary paid to other approved religious communities as well.[19] Immigrant groups and the Muslim society are divided on the issue, as some think official Christianity is preferable to a purely secular state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Pure equality of religions exists only in a minority of Western European countries. Besides Denmark, only the Faroe Islands, Iceland, England and Greece have official state churches, while Scotland has an officially recognised national church that is not connected to the state. Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria have official ties to Catholicism (concordat), but these ties do not extend to Catholicism being recognised as the state religion in these countries. Further there are varying degrees of public funding of the church in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Sweden in most cantons of Switzerland, and in the Alsace-Moselle region of France.</p><h3>Similar Nordic Evangelical-Lutheran churches[edit]</h3><h2>Controversial issues[edit]</h2><p>See also: Homosexuality and Lutheranism</p><h3>Female clergy[edit]</h3><p>The ordination of women, having been discussed within the church since the 1920s, has been allowed since 1948, despite some rather strong early resistance from the clergy. The then Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs was contacted by a parochial council who wished to employ a female priest. He decided there was no legal obstacle to that.[20] The first woman to become a bishop was instituted in 1995. Today two thirds of theology students are women, and the clergy is expected to have a female majority in the near future.</p><p>Among a small conservative minority, resistance to women ordained as clergy remains. In 2007 the Bishop of Viborg, known as a moderate conservative, revealed that he had given special consideration to priests who were known to be against ordained women. He had organised ordination ceremonies in such a way that new priests who so wished could avoid shaking hands with, or receiving the laying on of hands from, women ordained as priests. According to the bishop, this had happened twice in the 100 ordinations he had performed. The matter became headline news amidst a debate about Muslim fundamentalists who refuse to shake hands with members of the opposite sex. The Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Bertel Haarder, said he would discuss the matter with the bishops, but also stated that tolerance for various views should be respected. In contrast, the Minister for Employment, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, thought that the priests in question should be dismissed, as public employees are obliged to shake hands with anyone.[21]</p><h3>Same-sex marriage[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Same-sex marriage in Denmark</p><p>A 2011 poll of the Danish public found that 75.8% of Danes approve of same-sex marriages being performed in the church.[22]</p><p>According to a 2011 survey of 1137 priests, 62% of them supported same-sex marriage in the Church on the same basis as for heterosexuals, while 28% were against. A map of the results hints at the traditional west-east division, with a conservative wing being dominant in central West Jutland (the former Ringkjøbing Amt) and on Bornholm, but liberal priests dominating in most other areas.[23]</p><p>In 2004, a poll among pastors said 60% were against church marriage of same-sex couples.[24]</p><p>Early position of the church[edit]</p><p>Since Denmark approved same-sex civil unions (registered partnership) in 1989, the question of church blessing ceremonies for such unions emerged. After an enquiry from the Danish National Association of Gays and Lesbians in 1993, bishops set up a commission to reach a stance on the matter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An early stance on registered partnerships was reached in 1997. Bishops maintained that the ceremony of marriage was God's framework for the relation between a man and a woman, but this view of marriage was not affected by the fact that some people chose to live in a responsible community with a person of the same sex, approved by society, i.e. a registered partnership. The bishops disapproved of institutionalising new rituals, but couples who wished a non-ritualised marking in church of their registered partnership should be obliged. In such cases, it would be up to the rector to decide, and he should seek advice from his bishop.[25]</p><p>At this time, many churches chose to bless registered partnerships, however this blessing was distinguished from a legal ceremony, which was performed by a mayor or another municipal official.[26]</p><p>Same-sex marriages accepted[edit]</p><p>However, on 15 June 2012 the Church of Denmark made the decision to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and not merely bless them; therefore Denmark now recognises same-sex marriages. In early 2012 Minister for Equality, Ecclesiastical Affairs and Nordic Cooperation Manu Sareen introduced a bill approving same-sex marriage, which was passed in parliament in June 2012.[27] A wedding ritual with liturgy has been developed and presented to parliament by the eleven bishops who are in favor of same-sex marriages being performed in church.[28] Manu Sareen and a majority of bishops initially proposed the ritual would not declare the same-sex couple 'spouses', but 'life partners' (livsfæller, a Danish neologism), but the minister later changed his mind on this detail. Two conservative organisations within the church, Inner Mission and Lutheran Mission, as well as one of the twelve bishops, maintain their protests against same-sex marriage.[29] It will be up to each individual priest to decide whether he or she will conduct marriages of same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple was married on Friday 15 June.[30]</p><p>The process towards the official recognition of same sex marriage in the Church of Denmark began on 8 February 1973, when 'Provo Priest' Harald Søbye performed a wedding of a male couple, although not legally recognised, on a suggestion from a journalist at the newspaper Ekstra Bladet, which announced it as 'The World's First Gay Wedding'. On 25 February 1973 Harald Søbye performed another wedding, of a female couple, in a television programme. The state prosecutor investigated the cases, but concluded that the priest's use of his vestment was not illegal. Søbye had been retired in 1964 for political activism, but remained an ordained priest within the church. During the next 15 years, Søbye performed around 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples.[31]</p><p>When Denmark introduced registered partnerships in 1989, the issue of same-sex marriage for some years received little attention. Church blessings of these partnerships slowly gained ground (see above). Later, the possibility of registered partnership, or same-sex marriage, performed by the church came under discussion. The issue was brought up in an unusual way by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2004, who said he would approve of such a change, although he claimed to speak as a private person on this issue, not as prime minister.</p><p>Views among proponents vary whether such a ceremony should be called 'marriage' or merely 'registered partnership' (registreret partnerskab), as the present same-sex civil union is called. Most likely, clergy would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages or not, similar to the right to deny remarriage of divorced persons (a policy employed by a conservative minority of priests).</p><p>Constitutionality[edit]</p><p>A further controversy is that this new practice may be against the Danish constitution; §4 of the Danish constitution states: The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17]</p><p>§4 not only establish Folkekirken as the state church, but also gives certain boundaries as to what the state church is. It is forced to follow the Lutheran doctrines and if, as some critics claim [1], the Lutheran doctrines explicitly state that homosexuality is a sin then it is a violation of the constitution to allow gay marriages in the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Gay clergy[edit]</h3><p>Gay and lesbian clergy exist, and this is generally considered a strictly personal issue. Parish councils are central in selecting and employing new priests, including interviews with candidates. Once employed, parish priests are public servants and cannot be discharged except for neglect of duties, which will finally be the bishop's decision.</p><p>In 2011 a female priest serving two small island parishes was fired after controversies with the parish council of Agersø, while the neighbouring Omø supported her. She claimed to have been ousted because of her sexuality, but the parish council rejected this accusation and mentioned 'cooperation problems' as the cause. Twenty years ago she had come out as lesbian and a practitioner of sadomasochism in a Swedish TV programme.[32][33]</p><p>In 2009 a parish priest in Tingbjerg, a Copenhagen suburb, moved away from the parish to a secret address after assaults against his vicarage, his car and the parish church. The vicarage was put up for sale. According to Avisen.dk, local youths claimed they harassed him because he was openly homosexual, among other reasons.[34] The priest himself denied this was the issue, but rather claimed the assaults were part of a general tendency in the 'crumbling district', and intensified after he spoke out in public about the local youth crime.[35] A Sunday service held a few weeks later was attended by several prominent guests supporting the priest, including Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, and photographer Jacob Holdt.[36] Tingbjerg is a single-plan public housing area, marked by gang violence and youth crime, and the most criminal district of Copenhagen.[37]</p><h3>Declaration Dominus Iesus[edit]</h3><p>In 2000, the Church of Denmark's ecumenical department publicly criticized the Roman Catholic declaration Dominus Iesus, which controversially used the term ecclesial community to refer to Protestant denominations, including Lutheran churches. The Church of Denmark argued that there is a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another of the right to be called a Church and that it is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian.[38]</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas, around 15–20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their home language.</p><p>Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples that lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic. A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as Mainland Scandinavian while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as Insular Scandinavian.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Until the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions. With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing, a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared, though there are regional variants of the standard language. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.</p><p>Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 phonemically distinctive vowels,[4] and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon stød, a kind of laryngeal phonation type. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and weakly pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand,[5] and there is some evidence that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish.[6] The grammar is moderately inflective with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. As in English, Danish only has remnants of a former case system, particularly in the pronouns, and it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is V2, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/North_Germanic_languages.svg/300px-North_Germanic_languages.svg.png" width="300" height="200"><br><p>Danish and its relation to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European</p><p>Danish is a Germanic language of the North Germanic branch. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the Old Norse language; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.[7][8]</p><p>Scandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where there are no sharp dividing lines between the different vernacular languages.[7]</p><p>Like Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.[7]</p><p>Danish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), Insular Danish (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including Bornholmian and Scanian). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.[7]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Mutual intelligibility[edit]</h3><p>Danish is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Swedish. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.[9] The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.[10] Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.[9]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Danish</p><h3>Donsk tunga[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Old Norse</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG/250px-Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG" width="250" height="184"><br><p>The approximate extent of Old Norse and related languages in the early 10th century:

Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson[11]</p><p>By the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language was generally called the Danish tongue (Donsk tunga), or Norse language (Norrœnt mál). Norse was written in the runic alphabet, first with the elder futhark and from the 9th century with the younger futhark.</p><p>From the 7th century the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Denmark and Sweden). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.[12] A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong æi (Old West Norse ei) to the monophthong e, as in stæin to sten. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin. There was also a change of au as in dauðr into ø as in døðr. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tauþr into tuþr. Moreover, the øy (Old West Norse ey) diphthong changed into ø as well, as in the Old Norse word for island. This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.[13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Through Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England. Many words derived from Norse, such as gate (gade) for street, still survive in Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia, parts of eastern England colonized by Danish Vikings. The city of York was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example are (er), knife (kniv), husband (husbond), and egg (æg).[14] The suffix -by for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby and Grimsby. The word dale meaning valley is common in Yorkshire and Derbyshire placenames.</p><h3>Old Danish[edit]</h3><p>Fangær man saar i hor seng mæth annæns mansz kunæ. oc kumær han burt liuænd....

Jutlandic Law, 1241 [15]</p><p>In the medieval period Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The Jutlandic Law and Scanian Law were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350 Danish began to be used as a language of administration and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.[16]</p><p>Throughout this period Danish was in contact with Low German, and many Low German loans were introduced in this period.[17] With the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. It is also in this period that Danish begins to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the stød the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.[18]</p><p>The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the Rimkrøniken (Rhyming Chronicle), a history book told in rhymed verses.[19] The first complete translation of the Bible in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by Christiern Pedersen was published in 1550. Pedersen's orthographic choices set the de facto standard for subsequent writing in Danish.[20]</p><h3>Early Modern Danish[edit]</h3><p>Herrer og Narre have frit Sprog.

Peder Syv, proverbs</p><p>Following the first Bible translation the development of Danish as a written language, and as a language of religion, administration and public discourse sped up. In the second half of the 17th century a number of grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them Rasmus Bartholin's 1657 Latin grammar De studio lingvæ danicæ; then Laurids Olufsen Kock's 1660 grammar of the Zealand dialect Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, Den Danske Sprog-Kunst (The Art of the Danish Language) by Peder Syv. Significant authors from this period are Thomas Kingo, poet and psalmist, and Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, whose novel Jammersminde (Remembered Woes) is considered a literary masterpiece. Orthography was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of Jens Pedersen Høysgaard was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the stød. In this period scholars were also discussing whether it was best to write as one speaks or to speak as one writes, including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. han er he is vs. de ere they are).</p><p>The East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the Treaty of Brömsebro after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, begininnig also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the de facto official standard language, especially in writing - this was the original so-called rigsdansk (Danish of the Realm). Also beginning in the mid 18th century, the skarre-R, the uvular R sound ([?]), began spreading through Denmark, probably through influence from Parisian French and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden and coastal southern Norway.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 18th century Danish philology was advanced by Rasmus Rask, who pioneered the disciplines of comparative and historical linguistics and wrote the first English language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish flourished with the works of Ludvig Holberg, whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by Hans Egede, Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language up until the mid 20th century.</p><h3>Standardized national language[edit]</h3><p>Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,

N.F.S. Grundtvig, "Modersmaalet"</p><p>Following the loss of Schleswig to Germany, a sharp influx of German speakers moved into the area, eventually outnumbering the Danish speakers. The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called Golden Age of Danish culture. Authors such as N.F.S. Grundtvig emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish language authors of this period are existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and prolific fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen.[22] The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the Schleswig referendum in 1920 a number of Danes remained as a minority within German territories.[23] Throughout the 19th Century Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina where memory and some use of Danish remains today.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png/220px-LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png" width="220" height="237"><br><p>Language shift in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig.</p><p>After the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter Å/å. Three 20th century Danish authors have become Nobel Prize laureates in Literature: Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan (joint recipients in 1917) and Johannes V. Jensen (awarded 1944).</p><p>With the exclusive use of rigsdansk, the High Copenhagenian Standard, in national broadcasting, the traditional dialects came under increased pressure. In the 20th century they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country.[24] Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called regionssprog (regional languages) remain, and are in some cases vital. Today the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagenian, associated with elderly, well to-do and well educated people of the capital, and low-Copenhagenian traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations.[25][26] Also in the 21st century the influence of immigration has had linguistic consequences, such as the emergence of a so-called multiethnolect in the urban areas, an immigrant Danish variety (also known as Perkerdansk), combining elements of different immigrant languages such as Arabic, Turkish and Kurdish, as well as English and Danish.[25]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Geographic distribution[edit]</h2><p>Danish is the national language of Denmark and one of two official languages of the Faroe Islands (alongside Faroese). Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside Greenlandic). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as lingua franca, and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speak Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English.[27]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG/220px-Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Learn Danish banner in Flensburg, Germany where it is an officially recognized regional language</p><p>In addition, there is a noticeable community of Danish speakers in Southern Schleswig, the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized regional language, just as German is north of the border. Furthermore, Danish is one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council.[28] Under the Nordic Language Convention, Danish-speaking citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.[28]</p><p>The more widespread of the two varieties of Norwegian, Bokmål, is very close to Danish, because standard Danish was used as the de facto administrative language until 1814. Bokmål is based on Danish unlike the other variety of Norwegian, Nynorsk, which is based on the Norwegian dialects, with Old Norwegian as an important reference point.[7]</p><p>There is no law stipulating an official language for Denmark, making Danish the de facto language only. The Code of Civil Procedure does, however, lay down Danish as the language of the courts.[29] Since 1997 public authorities have been obliged to observe the official spelling by way of the Orthography Law. In the 21st century there have been discussions regarding creating a language law that would make Danish the official language of Denmark.[30]</p><h2>Dialects[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish dialects</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Danishdialectmap.png/250px-Danishdialectmap.png" width="250" height="184"><br><p>Map of Danish dialects</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Denmark-stoed.png/220px-Denmark-stoed.png" width="220" height="258"><br><p>A map showing the distribution of stød in Danish dialects.

In Zealand the transition from three to two genders has happened fairly recently. West of the red line the definite article goes before the word as in English or German; east of the line it takes the form of a suffix.</p><p>Standard Danish (rigsdansk) is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital, Copenhagen. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.[24][7]</p><p>Danish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects. Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.[31][24]</p><p>Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas:</p><p>Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic. Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn and Lolland-Falster dialect areas - each with addition internal variation. The term Eastern Danish[35] is occasionally used for Bornholmian, but including the dialects of Scania (particularly in a historical context). Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish and Bornholmian. Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to Sweden and subsequently swedified.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Traditional dialects differ both in phonology, grammar and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of stød.[36] There are four main regional variants for the realization of stød: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland and Ærø, there is no stød but instead a pitch accent. South of a line (Danish: Stødgrænsen The Stød border) going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, Møn, Southern Zealand and Bornholm there is neither stød nor pitch accent.[37] In most of Jutland and on Zealand there is stød, and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language there are often more stød occurrences than in the standard language. In Zealand the stød line divides Southern Zealand (without stød), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.[38][39]</p><p>Grammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of suffixes, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as West Germanic languages. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three grammatical genders.[34] Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900 Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.[40] Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: Katti, han får unger, literally The cat, he is having kittens, because cat is a male noun, and thus are referred to as han (he), even if it is female cat.[41]</p><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish phonology</p><p>The sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody. In informal or rapid speech the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language's prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to segment the speech flow into its constituent elements.[5][42] These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and there are even indications that Danish children take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.[6]</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><p>Although somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels and two schwa vowels, /?/ and /?/ that only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes - a very large number among the world's languages.[43] At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either [i?], [u?] or [??].[44] The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by Grønnum (1998) in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in IPA for Danish. Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. Basbøll (2005):50 gives 25 full vowels, not counting the two unstressed schwa-vowels.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>The consonant inventory is comparatively simple. Basbøll (2005:73) distinguishes 16 non-syllabic consonant phonemes in Danish.</p><p>Many of these phonemes have quite different allophones in onset and coda. Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration and fortis vs. lenis.[44] /p t k/ are aspirated in onset realized as [b??, d??, g°?], but not in coda. The pronunciation of t, [d??], is in between a simple aspirated [d??] and a fully affricated [d?s] as has happened in German with many words that now contain z. The stops /b d g/ are realized as [b?, d?, g°] in onset and as [b? ð???, j/??] in coda. In syllable onset the phonemes /b d g v j r/ are contoid (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become vocoids, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, løb/ (grave, ran) are pronounced [grau?, løu?].</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>[?, ð] often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as approximants. Danish [ð] differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar approximant which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] (or [?]) by second language learners.[44]</p><p>The sound [?] is found for example in the word /sjov?/ fun pronounced [??u??] and /tjal?/ marijuana pronounced [t?al?]. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after /s/ or /t/ and [j] doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an allophone of /j/, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a /?/-phoneme in Danish.[46]</p><p>In onset /r/ is realized as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant, [?], but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic low central vowel, [??] or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the r in German or in non-rhotic pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of /r/ as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled [r].</p><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Danish is characterized by a prosodic feature called stød (lit. thrust). This is a form of laryngealization or creaky voice. Some sources have described it as a glottal stop, but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.[47] It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in minimal pairs such as bønder (peasants) with stød, versus bønner (beans) without stød. The distribution of stød in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian pitch accents found in most dialects of Norwegian and Swedish.[48]</p><p>Stress is phonemic and distinguishes words such as billigst ['bilist] cheapest and bilist [bi'list] car driver.[49]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish grammar</p><p>Similarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs tager/tog (takes/took) and fod/fødder (foot/feet)) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as elsker/elskede love/loved, bil/biler car/cars). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.[50]</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an enclitic. A distinctive feature of the Scandinavian languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. fod/fødder foot/feet, mand/mænd man/men) or weak stems inflected through affixation (e.g. skib/skibe ship/ships, kvinde/kvinder woman/women).[51]</p><p>Gender[edit]
Main article: Gender in Danish and Swedish</p><p>Standard Danish has two nominal genders: common and neuter; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the common gender, and neuter is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized.The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. [52]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Definiteness[edit]</p><p>Definiteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.[53] Neuter nouns take the clitic -et, and common gender nouns take -en. Indefinite nouns take the articles en (common gender) or et (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun en mand a man (indefinite) has the definite form manden the man, whereas the neuter noun et hus a house (indefinite) has the definite form, the house (definite) huset.[52] [54]</p><p>Indefinite:</p><p>Jeg så et hus
"I saw a house"</p><p>Definite with enclitic article:</p><p>Jeg så huset
"I saw the house"</p><p>Definite with preposed demonstrative article:</p><p>Jeg så det store hus[55]
"I saw the big house"</p><p>The plural definite ending is -(e)ne (e.g. drenge boys &gt; drengene the boys and piger girls &gt; pigerne the girls), and nouns ending in -ere lose the last -e before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. danskere Danes &gt; danskerne the Danes). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article den (common) or det (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: den store mand the big man, det store hus the big house.[56][54]</p><p>Number[edit]</p><p>There are three different types of regular plurals: Class 1 forms the plural with the suffix -er (indefinite) and -erne (definite), Class 2 with the suffix -e (indefinite) and -ene (definite.), and Class 3 takes no suffix for the plural indefinite form and -ene for the plural definite.[57]</p><p>Most irregular nouns take an ablaut plural (with a change in the stem vowel), or combine ablaut stem-change with the suffix, and some have unique plural forms. Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of øje eye, which is the old dual form øjne), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word konto account which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form konti accounts).[58][59]</p><p>Possession[edit]</p><p>Possessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -s, for example min fars hus my father's house where the noun far carries the possessive enclitic.[60] This is however not a case of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik the king of Denmark's candy factory, or det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with, where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.[61][62]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>As does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (han he), animate feminine (hun she) forms, as well as inanimate neuter (det it) and inanimate common gender (den it) [63]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Jeg sover
"I sleep"


Du sover
"you sleep"


Jeg kysser dig
"I kiss you"


du kysser mig
"you kiss me"</p><p>Possessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (det er min hest it is my horse), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (den er min it is mine). In the third person singular sin is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas hans (his), hendes (her) and dens/dets its is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.[64][65]</p><p>Han tog sin hat
He took his (own) hat


Han tog hans hat
He took his hat (someone else's hat)

Nominal compounds[edit]</p><p>Like all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in kvindehåndboldlandsholdet, the female national handball team. In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra s, originally possessive in function, like landsmand (from land, country, and mand, man, meaning compatriot), but landmand (from same roots, meaning farmer). Some words are joined with an extra e, like gæstebog (from gæst and bog, meaning guest book).</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>Danish verbs are morphologically simple, marking very few grammatical categories. They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.[66]</p><p>Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice[edit]</p><p>Verbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.[53] The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -te and those that take the suffix -ede.[67]</p><p>The infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced [?]), infinitive forms are preceded by the article at (pronounced [?]).[67] The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -r, except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.[68]</p><p>The present participle ends in -ende (e.g. løbende running), and the past participle ends in -et (e.g. løbet run), -t (e.g. købt bought). Additional composite tenses are constructed with auxiliary verbs (e.g. at være to be and at have to have) and participial forms:</p><p>Hun er gået
"She has left"


Hun har gået
"She has walked"


Hun var gået
"She had left"


Hun blev siddende
She remained seated (lit. "she stayed sitting")</p><p>The passive form takes the suffix -s: avisen læses hver dag (the newspaper is read every day). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb at blive to become: avisen bliver læst hver dag.[68][69]</p><p>The imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:</p><p>løb!
"run!"</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Danish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is Subject-Verb-Object.[70] However, Danish is also a V2 language, which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian Paul Diderichsen[71] Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or grounding) field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or topics. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.[72]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Peter (S) så (V) Jytte (O)
"Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>but</p><p>I går så (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)
"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>When there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a dummy subject der.[73]</p><p>der kom en pige ind ad døren
there came a girl in through the door
"A girl came in the door"

Main clauses[edit]</p><p>Haberland (1994, p.&nbsp;336) describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:</p><p>Position 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.[72]</p><p>Questions with wh-words are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.</p><p>Wh-question:</p><p>hvem så du?'
who saw you
"who did you see?"


så du ham?
saw you him?
"did you see him?"

Subordinate clauses[edit]</p><p>In subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).[74] Complement clauses begin with the particle at in the connector field.</p><p>Han sagde at han ikke ville gå
he said that he not would go
"He said that he did not want to go"</p><p>Relative clauses are marked by the relative articles som or der which occupy the preverbal slot:</p><p>Jeg kender en mand som bor i Helsingør[75]
"I know a man who lives in Elsinore"</p><h2>Vocabulary[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG/220px-Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Danish label reading militærpoliti, "military police", on police vehicle</p><p>About 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the Old Norse language, and ultimately from Proto Indo-European. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.[76] Danish has also absorbed a considerable number of loan words, most of which were borrowed from Middle Low German in the late medieval period. Out of the 500 most frequently used Words in Danish, 100 are Medieval loans from Middle Low German.[77] In the 17th and 18th Centuries standard German and French superseded Low German influence and in the 20th Century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after World War II. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with æde (to eat) which became less common when the Low German spise came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard text in contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16-17% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4-8&nbsp;%, French 2-4&nbsp;% and English about 1%.[77]</p><p>Danish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, Danish words for commonly used nouns and prepositions are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers, such as have, over, under, for, give, flag, salt, and kat.[78] Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their Scottish equivalents, e.g., kirke (Scottish kirk, i.e., 'church') or barn (Scottish bairn, i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word by, meaning village or town, occurs in many English place-names, such as Whitby and Selby, as remnants of the Viking occupation. During the latter period, English adopted are, the third person plural form of the verb to be, as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form they from contemporary Old Norse.</p><h3>Numerals[edit]</h3><p>In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered enogtyve, literally one and twenty.</p><p>The numeral halvanden means 1½ (literally half second, implying one plus half of the second one). The numerals halvtredje (2½), halvfjerde (3½) and halvfemte (4½) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the vigesimal system described below. Similarly, the temporal designation klokken halv tre, literally half three o'clock, is half past two.</p><p>One peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (somewhat like the French numerals from 80 through 99) based on a vigesimal system, meaning that the score (20) is used as a base unit in counting. Tres (short for tre-sinds-tyve, three times twenty) means 60, while 50 is halvtreds (short for halvtredje-sinds-tyve, half third times twenty, implying two score plus half of the third score). The ending sindstyve meaning times twenty is no longer included in cardinal numbers, but still used in ordinal numbers. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as tooghalvtreds from the now obsolete tooghalvtredsindstyve, whereas 52nd is either tooghalvtredsende or tooghalvtredsindstyvende. Twenty is tyve (derived from old Danish tiughu, a haplology of tuttiughu, meaning 'two tens'[79]), while thirty is tredive (Old Danish þrjatiughu, three tens), and forty is fyrre (Old Danish fyritiughu, four tens[80] via fyrretyve.[81] Thus, the suffix -tyve should be understood as a plural of ti (10), though to modern Danes tyve means 20, making it hard to explain why fyrretyve is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four times twenty).</p><p>For large numbers (one billion or larger), Danish uses the long scale, so that the short scale billion (1,000,000,000) is called milliard, and the short scale trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is billion.</p><h2>Writing system[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Danish orthography</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG/220px-Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Danish keyboard with keys for Æ, Ø, and Å.</p><p>The oldest preserved examples of written Danish (from the Iron and Viking Ages) are in the Runic alphabet.[82] The introduction of Christianity also brought the Latin script to Denmark, and at the end of the High Middle Ages Runes had more or less been replaced by Latin letters.</p><p>Danish orthography is highly conservative, still using most of the conventions established in the 16th century. The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a severe gap between the spoken and written languages.[83]</p><p>The modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: æ, ø, and å, which come at the end of the alphabet, in that order. A spelling reform in 1948 introduced the letter å, already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the digraph aa.[82] The old usage still occurs in some personal and geographical names (for example, the name of the city of Aalborg is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and Aarhus decided to go back to Aa in 2011). When representing the å sound, aa is treated just like å in alphabetical sorting, even though it looks like two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations (e.g., in URLs), they are often replaced by ae (Æ, æ), oe or o (Ø, ø), and aa (Å, å), respectively.</p><p>The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense vilde (would), kunde (could) and skulde (should), to their current forms of ville, kunne and skulle (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech). Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly, particularly with the phonetic spelling of loanwords; for example the spelling of station and garage in Danish remains identical to other languages, whereas in Norwegian, they are transliterated as stasjon and garasje.</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p>Åkesson, K.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The Danish colonial empire (Danish: danske kolonier) and pre Dano-Norwegian empire (Norwegian: Danmark-Norges kolonier) denotes the colonies that Denmark-Norway (Denmark alone after 1814) possessed from 1536 until 1953. At its apex the colonial empire spanned four continents (Europe, South America, Africa and Asia). The period of colonial expansion marked a rise in the status and power of Danes and Norwegians in the union. Being the hegemon of Denmark-Norway or the Statsfædrelandet (lit. State Fathers' Land), Denmark is where the union's monumental palaces are now located and Copenhagen, today the capital of Denmark, was the city which both Norway and Denmark came to establish as their capital. Much of the Norwegian population moved to find work in Copenhagen, attend the University, or join the Royal Fleet. At it height the empire had an area of 2,655,564.76 km2 [1]</p><p>In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in Africa, the Caribbean, and India. After 1814, when Norway was granted to Sweden following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained what remained of Norway's great medieval colonial holdings. Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway's overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe. Denmark-Norway's first colony was established at Tranquebar (Trankebar) on India's southern coast in 1620. Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.</p><p>Today, the only remaining vestiges of this empire are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953. They are now autonomous countries of the Kingdom of Denmark with home rule, in a relationship referred to as the Unity of the Realm.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Overview[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish Gold Coast</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg/250px-Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg" width="250" height="148"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>A contemporary depiction of Fort Christiansborg</p><p>Denmark maintained several tradings stations and four forts on the Gold Coast in west Africa, especially around modern day Ghana. Three trading stations were built:[2] Fort Frederiksborg, Kpompo; Osu Castle by Accra in 1661, that was purchased from Sweden; and Frederiksberg. The forts were Fort Prinsensten built in 1784, Fort Augustaborg from 1787, Fort Friedensborg and Fort Kongensten, several of which are ruins today. Of these, only one is still used today, Fort Christiansborg, which is the Ghanaian president's residence in Ghana.</p><p>Plantations were established by Frederiksborg, but they failed. Fort Christiansborg became the base for Danish power in west Africa, and the centre for slave trade to the Danish West Indies. In 1807, Denmark's African business partners were suppressed by the Akan people subgroup-Ashanti, which led to the abandonment of all trading stations. Denmark sold its forts to the United Kingdom in 1850.</p><h3>Americas[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish colonization of the Americas</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg/220px-H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg" width="220" height="178"><br><p>The Høgensborg estate on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, 1833


Greenland[edit]
Main articles: History of Greenland and Royal Greenland Trade Department</p><p>With the ratification of the Kalmar Union in 1397, Denmark-Norway inherited Greenland which was previously part of Norway since its settlement in the Viking Age. After the Norse settlement in Greenland finally disappeared in the 15th century, Europeans did not settle the island again until 1721, when the Lutheran minister Hans Egede arrived and established the town now known as Nuuk. After Norway was ceded to Sweden in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the old territorial claims as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel.</p><p>The development and settlement of Greenland accelerated in 1945, instigated by the region's geostrategic importance in the Cold War era, itself exemplified and manifested by the US-Air base of Thule from 1943. Another reason and driving force was the emergence of fundamental technical abilities, such as aircraft and icebreakers at Greenland's disposition, giving the otherwise remote island a supply situation somewhat similar to Europe.</p><p>Danish West Indies[edit]
Main articles: Danish West Indies and Danish West India Company</p><p>Denmark-Norway acquired the island of St. Thomas in 1671[2] and St. Jan (now St. John) in 1718, and bought St. Croix from France in 1733. All of the islands' economies were based primarily on sugar. These islands were known as the Danish West Indies and were eventually sold to the United States in 1917 for 25 million dollars.[2] Several Danish-American succession talks had been made since 1870 due to a rising number of riots and unrest from the poorer English speaking population. The Zahle Government (1914-1920) held a heavily boycotted election for Danish mainland constituencies, which produced a minority for the sale of the islands. The United States hoped to use them as naval bases. Since 1917, the islands have been known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish India and Danish East India Company</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png/300px-European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png" width="300" height="184"><br><p>Danish and other European settlements in India.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/250px-A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="250" height="118"><br><p>Fort Dansborg at Tranquebar, built by Ove Gjedde, c. 1658</p><p>Denmark maintained a scattering of small colonies and trading posts throughout the Indian sub-continent from the 17th to 19th centuries, after which most were sold or ceded to Britain which had become the dominant power there.[2] The most important economic aspect was spice trade and access to the east Asian area, including Imperial China situated farther to the east.</p><p>The colony at Trankebar (modern day: Tharangambadi) was kept for over 200 years, with a few interruptions, until it was sold to the British in 1845.</p><p>In 1755 Denmark acquired the Frederiksnagore (now Serampore), and later the towns of Achne and Pirapur.

Other colonial ventures include colonization attempts of the Nicobar Islands, called Frederiksøerne (Frederik Islands) or Ny Danmark (New Denmark) by the Danes between 1754 and 1868.</p><h3>Atlantic[edit]</h3><p>Faroe Islands[edit]
Main article: History of the Faroe Islands</p><p>As with Greenland, Denmark-Norway inherited the medieval Norwegian claims to the Faroe Islands as the successor state to Norway. The Faroes had become part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. After Norway was given to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the Faroes as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel. Status as a Danish county ended in 1948, and the Faroes were given a large degree of independence within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>Iceland[edit]

In 1918 Iceland became a fully sovereign kingdom, titled the Kingdom of Iceland, in personal union with Denmark.</p><p>During Nazi Germany's Occupation of Denmark (1940) the Republic of Iceland was declared on June 17, 1944.</p><h3>Danish Estonia and Courland[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish Estonia and Bishopric of Courland</p><p>In the 13th-14th centuries, Denmark ruled parts of what is now Estonia. The colony was initially named the Duchy of Estonia (Danish: Hertugdømmet Estland) and is retrospectively called Danish Estonia by historians. In 1559 the bishop of Courland and Ösel-Wiek Johannes V von Münchhausen sold his lands to the King Frederick II of Denmark for 30,000 thalers. The Danish king gave the territory to his younger brother Duke Magnus of Holstein. After Magnus of Livonia died in 1583, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth invaded his territories in the Bishopric of Courland and Frederick II of Denmark decided to sell his rights of inheritance. In 1645, Saaremaa was ceded from Denmark to Sweden by the Treaty of Brömsebro.</p><h2>Demise[edit]</h2><p>The downfall of the Danish colonial empire was caused by a lack of resources.[2] The empire was quickly eclipsed by those of France, Britain and the Netherlands. Eventually Denmark sold its colonies in India to Britain.[2]</p><h2>Legacy[edit]</h2><p>Greenland and the Faroe Islands are the last vestiges of the colonial empire. Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953, and it became an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It gained home rule in 1979 and further autonomy, including self-determination, in 2009. Likewise, the Faroes were incorporated into the Kingdom in the eighteenth century, with the status of a county, and then given home rule in 1948.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

				This article is about the Eskimo–Aleut language. For the extinct North Germanic language, see Greenlandic Norse.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut. The main variety, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the Naalakkersuisut (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, Danish. The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic. The Thule Inuit of Greenland, Inuktun or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut.</p><p>Greenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (subject) of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (subject) of a transitive verb.</p><p>Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in transitive clauses is subject–object–verb. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables switch-reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as yesterday or now or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.</p><p>When adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the Thule people in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland.</p><p>The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.[4]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg/350px-Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg.png" width="350" height="313"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.</p><p>From the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.[5]</p><p>From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.[5]</p><p>Another development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of greenlandization of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.[6] Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic. The newspaper Sermitsiaq, has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten, which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.[7][8]</p><p>Before June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish.[note 1] Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language.[2] This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an indigenous language of the Americas that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi-independent country. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be in a vulnerable state by the UNESCO Red Book of Language Endangerment.[9] The country has a 100% literacy rate.[10] As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant, a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect.[11]</p><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><p>Kalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the Eskimo–Aleut family and are closely related to the Inuit languages of Canada and Alaska. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.</p><p>The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut), which is the official language of Greenland. The name Kalaallisut is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, Inuktun (Avanersuarmiutut), spoken in the vicinity of the city of Qaanaaq (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect (Tunumiit oraasiat), spoken in the vicinity of Ammassalik Island and Ittoqqortoormiit, is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.[14] Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around Upernavik has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of Uummannaq and the Disko Bay. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in Sisimiut in the north, around Nuuk and as far south as Maniitsoq. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around Narsaq and Qaqortoq in the south.[4] Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for humans in the three main dialects. It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, maintaining the gh which has been elided in Kalaallisut, and Tunumiisut is the most innovative, having further simplified the structure by eliding the /n/.</p><p>Michael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argues for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and the Eskimo–Aleut languages in Language Relations Across Bering Strait (1998). He calls this proposed grouping the Uralo-Siberian languages.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>See also: Inuit phonology</p><p>Letters between slashes / / indicate phonemic transcription, letters in square brackets [ ] indicate phonetic transcription and letters in triangular brackets ? ? indicate standard Greenlandic orthography.</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg/250px-West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg.png" width="250" height="210"><br><p>Ranges of West Greenlandic monophthongs on a vowel chart.[15]</p><p>The Greenlandic three vowel system, composed of /i/, /u/, and /a/, is typical for an Eskimo–Aleut language. Double vowels are analyzed as two morae, so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.[16][17] The only diphthong in the language is /ai/, which occurs only at the ends of words.[18] Before a uvular consonant ([q] or [?]), /i/ is realized allophonically as [e], [?] or [?], and /u/ is realized allophonically as [o] or [?], and the two vowels are written e, o respectively (as in some orthographies used for Quechua and Aymara).[19] /a/ becomes retracted to [?] in the same environment. /i/ is rounded to [y] before labial consonants.[19] /u/ is fronted to [?] between two coronal consonants.[19]</p><p>The allophonic lowering of /i/ and /u/ before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing /i/ and /u/ as ?e? and ?o? respectively before uvulars ?q? and ?r?. For example:</p><p>/ui/ "husband" pronounced [ui].
/uiqarpuq/ "she has a husband" pronounced [ueq??p?q] and written ?ueqarpoq?.


/illu/ "house" pronounced [i??u].
/illuqarpuq/ "he has a house" pronounced [i??oq??p?q] and written ?illoqarpoq?.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic has consonants at five points of articulation: labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular. It does not have phonemic voicing contrast, but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.[note 2] The earlier palatal sibilant [?] has merged with [s] in all but a few dialects.[20] The labiodental fricative [f] is only contrastive in loanwords. The alveolar stop [t] is pronounced as an affricate [t?s] before the high front vowel /i/. Often, Danish loanwords containing ?b d g? preserve these, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example ?baaja? [pa?ja] beer and ?Guuti? [ku?t?i] God; these are pronounced exactly as /p t k/.[4]</p><h3>Phonological constraints[edit]</h3><p>The Kalaallisut syllable is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word-final /ai/.[21] Native words may only begin with a vowel or /p, t, k, q, s, m, n/; they may end only in /p, t, k, q/ or rarely /n/. Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.[22]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic prosody does not include stress as an autonomous category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters.[17] Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.[23]</p><p>Geminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.[24]</p><p>Intonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.[23][25]</p><h3>Morphophonology[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.</p><p>Greenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is /?/. The first consonant in a cluster is always assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate /tt/ is pronounced [ts] and written ?ts?. Geminate /ll/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [ç?] but is written ?gg?. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /vv/ is pronounced [f?] and written ?ff?. /v/ is also pronounced and written [f] after /?/.[26]</p><p>These assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, iglu (house), is illu in Greenlandic, where the /gl/ consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. And the word Inuktitut itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes Inuttut. The Old Greenlandic diphthong /au/ has assimilated to /aa/.</p><p>The consonant /v/ has disappeared when between /u/ and /i/ or /a/. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without [v] when suffixed to stems ending in /u/.</p><p>The vowel /i/ of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo–Aleut vowels *i and *?. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.[27] In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned morphophonologically in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *? has the variant [a] when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.[28]</p><p>The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, Inuktun, which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (Tunumiit oraasiat) has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. [??] to [t?]. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is Ittoqqortoormiit, which would appear as Illoqqortoormiut in Kalaallisut.[13][14]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg/350px-Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg" width="350" height="263"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to "parking forbidden for all vehicles".</p><p>The morphology of Greenlandic is highly synthetic and exclusively suffixing,[29] with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.[note 5] In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.[30][note 6] The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.[31]</p><p>There are few compound words, but lots of derivations.[32] The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.</p><p>The language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.[33]</p><p>In this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.[34]</p><p>The verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.[34] The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:</p><p>Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:</p><p>Sini-ppoq "(S)he sleeps"
sleep-3p/IND[note 8]</p><p>Intransitive clause with subject noun phrase:</p><p>Angut sinippoq "the man sleeps"
man.ABS sleep-3p/IND</p><p>Transitive clause with no overt arguments:</p><p>Asa-vaa "(S)he loves him/her/it"
love-3p/3p</p><p>Transitive clause with agent noun phrase:</p><p>Angut-ip asa-vaa "the man loves him/her/it"
man-ERG love-3p/3p</p><p>Transitive clause with patient noun phrase:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Arnaq asa-vaa "(S)he loves the woman"
woman.ABS love-3p/3p

Morphosyntactic alignment[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic language uses case to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.[35]</p><p>Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, instead of treating the grammatical relations as in most European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.[36] Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.[37]</p><p>Intransitive:</p><p>Anda sini-ppoq "Anda sleeps"
Anda.ABS sleep-3p/IND</p><p>Transitive with agent and object:</p><p>Anda-p nanoq taku-aa "Anda sees a bear"
Anda.ERG bear-ABS see-3p/3p

Word order[edit]</p><p>In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is AOXV / SXV, where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. Topical noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a focal subject or object as well. In spoken language also afterthought material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.[38]</p><p>On the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.[39]</p><p>In copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa "Anda bought the sweater"
Anda sweater bought
A O V</p><p>An attribute appears after its head noun.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa "Anda bought the blue sweater"
Anda sweater blue bought
A O X V</p><p>An attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:</p><p>Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq "Anda is a skilled carpenter"
Anda carpenter.IS skilled
S V APP

Coordination and Subordination[edit]</p><p>Syntactic coordination and subordination is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.[40] The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.[41]</p><p>Obviation and switch-reference[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as obviation[42] or switch-reference.[43] There is a special so-called fourth person[44] used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.[45] Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>illu-a taku-aa "he saw his (the other man's) house"
house-3POSS see-3p/3p


illu-ni taku-aa "he saw his own house"
house-4POSS see-3p/3p


Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkiga "Ole said I had hit him (the other man)"
Ole say-3p hit-I/3p

Eva come.in-4p sleep-expect-3p


Eva iser-pat sini-ssaa-q When Eva comes in (s)he'll sleep (someone else).
Eva come.in-3p sleep-expect-3p

Indefiniteness construction[edit]</p><p>There is no category of definiteness in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors, morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive[46][47] or intransitive object[48] conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.[49][50] This view, however, is controversial.[51]</p><p>Active:</p><p>Piitap arfeq takuaa "Peter saw the whale"
Peter-ERG whale see</p><p>Antipassive/intransitive object:</p><p>Piitaq arfermik takuvoq "Peter saw (a) whale"
Peter-ABS whale-INSTR see</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>The morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are inflection and derivation. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and voice (tense/aspect is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).[52][53][54] Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by adverbs in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as postbases rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.[55] Such semantically heavy suffixes may express concepts such as to have, to be, to say, or to think. The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.</p><p>Inflection[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.[56] The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.[57]</p><p>Indicative and interrogative moods[edit]</p><p>The indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing questions. Questions with the question particle immaqa maybe cannot use the interrogative mood.[58]</p><p>napparsima-vit? "Are you sick?"

The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).</p><p>Table 6 shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb asa- to love (an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection).</p><p>Imperative and Optative moods[edit]</p><p>The imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.[59]</p><p>sini-git! "Sleep!"

Causative mood[edit]</p><p>The causative mood (sometimes called the conjunctive) is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning because, since or when; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of that.

Derivation[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Verbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.</p><p>-katap- be tired of</p><p>taku-katap-para "I am tired of seeing it/him/her"

arrive-not.afterall-3p

Time reference and aspect[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,[64] and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of tense markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:[65]</p><p>toqo-riikatap-poq "He died long ago"[66]
die-long.ago-3p/IND
nere-qqammer-punga "I ate recently"[66]
eat-recently-I/IND
ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq "Yesterday Peter was running."[67]
yesterday Peter-ABS run-3p/IND</p><p>All other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal aktionsart.[67]</p><p>Piitaq arpap-poq "Peter runs"[67]
Peter-ABS run-3p/IND
Piitaq ani-voq "Peter was gone out"[67]
Peter-ABS go.out-3p/IND</p><p>But if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.[68]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. sar expressing habituality and ssaar expressing stop to.[69] Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: sima and nikuu. sima can occur in several positions with obviously different function[70] Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.</p><p>tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq "Apparently, she had arrived"[71]
arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/INT</p><p>With atelic verbs, there is a regular contrast between indirective evidentiality marked by sima and witnessed evidentiality marked by nikuu.[72] Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and sima sometimes is marked.[73]</p><p>qia-sima-voq "He cried (his eyes are swollen)"
cry-SIMA-3p/IND
qia-nikuu-voq "He cried (I was there)"
cry-NIKUU-3p/IND[72]</p><p>In the written language[66] and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.[74] That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.</p><p>Just as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:</p><p>e.g. Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu "I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer."

expect-I/3p/IND summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p



 

e.g. Aggiuti-ler-para "I've started to bring him."

bring-begin-I/3p/IND



 

e.g. Qimmi-t nirukkar-niar-nigik "Let us feed the dogs, ok?"[76]

dog-PL feed-please-we/them/IMP</p><p>While the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.[77][78] However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.[79]</p><p>Noun incorporation[edit]</p><p>There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.[47][80][81][82][83][84] This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.[85] Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.[86][87][88] The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>qimmeq dog + -qar- have (+ -poq 3p)</p><p>qimme-qar-poq "She has a dog"</p><p>illu house + -'lior- make</p><p>illu-lior-poq "She builds a house"</p><p>kaffi coffee + -sor- drink/eat</p><p>kaffi-sor-poq "She drinks coffee"</p><p>puisi seal + -nniar- hunt</p><p>puisi-nniar-poq "She hunts seal"</p><p>allagaq letter + -si- receive</p><p>allagar-si-voq "She has received a letter"</p><p>anaana mother + -a- to be</p><p>anaana-a-voq "She is a mother"</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.[89] Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. atuar- to read + -fik place becomes atuarfik school and atuarfik + -tsialak something good becomes atuarfitsialak good school.</p><p>The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.[90][note 10]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>There are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.[91]</p><p>Personal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:</p><p>ilin-nut niri-qu-aa
thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.
'He told you to eat it'

Case[edit]</p><p>The two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.</p><p>angu-t neri-voq "The man eats"

Possession[edit]</p><p>In Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.[97] Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of illu house. Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.</p><p>Anda-p illu-a "Anda's house"

Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word palasi priest is a loan from the Danish præst. But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. qarasaasiaq computer which literally means artificial brain. This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.[4] For example the root for tongue oqaq is used to derive the following words:</p><p>Lexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.[4]</p><h2>Orthography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG/220px-%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>? in a Greenlandic–Danish dictionary from 1926</p><p>Greenlandic is written with the Latin script. The alphabet:</p><p>A E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V</p><p>To spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters B, C, D, X, Y, Z, W, Æ, Ø and Å are used.[98][99] Greenlandic uses the symbols ... and&nbsp;»...«&nbsp;as quotation marks.</p><p>From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt. This alphabet employed the special character kra (?' / ?) which was replaced by q in the 1973 reform.[100] In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name Kalaallit Nunaat was spelled Kalâdlit Nunât. This scheme uses a circumflex accent ( ˆ ) to indicate a long vowel (e.g., ât/ît/ût, modern: aat, iit, uut), an acute accent ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e., á, í, ú modern: a(kk), i(kk), u(kk))] and, finally, a tilde ( ˜ ) or a grave accent ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g., ãt, it, ut or àt, ìt, ùt, modern: aatt, iitt, uutt). The letters ê and ô, used only before r and q, are now written ee and oo in Greenlandic. The spelling system of Nunatsiavummiutut, spoken in Nunatsiavut in northeastern Labrador, is derived from the old Greenlandic system.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)[101] whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.</p><h3>Sample text[edit]</h3><p>Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik.

				For other people with the same name, see Margaret of Denmark (disambiguation).</p><p>Margrethe II (Danish: Margrethe 2., pronounced&nbsp;[m?'g?æ??d?]; Faroese: Margreta 2.; Greenlandic: Margrethe II; full name: Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid; born 16 April 1940) is the Queen of Denmark. She is also the supreme authority of the Church of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defence Forces. Born into the House of Glücksburg, a royal house with origins in Northern Germany, she was the eldest child of Frederick IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden. She succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972, having had become heir presumptive to her father in 1953, when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. On her accession, Margrethe became the first female monarch of Denmark since Margaret I, ruler of the Scandinavian countries in 1375–1412 during the Kalmar Union. In 1967, she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, with whom she has two sons: Crown Prince Frederik (born 1968) and Prince Joachim (born 1969). She has been on the Danish throne for 45 years, becoming the second longest-reigning Danish monarch after her ancestor Christian IV.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Amalienborg_cph.jpg/220px-Amalienborg_cph.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg, photographed in 2006</p><p>Princess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as the first child of Crown Prince Frederick, later King Frederick IX and Crown Princess Ingrid, later Queen Ingrid. Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, and Crown Princess Margaret, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her birth took place just one week after Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940.[2]</p><p>She was baptised on 14 May in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen.[2] The Princess's godparents were: King Christian X (paternal grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V of Sweden (maternal great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (maternal grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (her maternal uncle); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (maternal grandmother's father).</p><p>She was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, Queen Alexandrine, and Ingrid after her mother, Crown Princess Ingrid. Since her paternal grandfather was also the King of Iceland, she was given an Icelandic name, Þórhildur (Thorhildur).[3]</p><p>When Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her first sister, Princess Benedikte, was born. Princess Benedikte later married Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister Princess Anne Marie was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married Constantine II of Greece and now lives in Greece.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Margrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at Gråsten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.</p><h2>Heir presumptive[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg/220px-Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg" width="220" height="270"><br><p>Princess Margrethe in 1966.</p><p>At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the Glücksburg branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle Prince Knud would one day assume the throne.</p><p>The process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new Act of Succession permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive.[2]</p><p>On her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the Council of State. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.[2]</p><p>In 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to Los Angeles, and to the Paramount Studios, where they were met by several celebrities, including Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley.[4]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><p>Margrethe was educated at the private school N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen from which she graduated in 1959. She spent a year at North Foreland Lodge, a boarding school for girls in Hampshire, England,[5] and later studied prehistoric archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge, during 1960–1961, political science at Aarhus University between 1961 and 1962, attended the Sorbonne in 1963, and was at the London School of Economics in 1965.[6] She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[2]</p><p>Queen Margrethe is fluent in Danish, French, English, Swedish and German, and has a limited knowledge of Faroese.[2][6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Marriage and children[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg/220px-Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Queen Margrethe II and her consort, Prince Henrik, in 2010.</p><p>Princess Margrethe married a French diplomat, Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, 10 June 1967, at the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen. Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish throne.[2]</p><p>Margrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son Frederik. A second child, named Joachim, was born 7 June 1969.[2]</p><h2>Reign[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Faroe_stamp_302_Queen_Margrethe.jpg/200px-Faroe_stamp_302_Queen_Margrethe.jpg" width="200" height="308"><br><p>Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the Faroese people. Stamp FR 302 of Postverk Føroya, Faroe Islands, issued 14 January 1997.</p><h3>Succession[edit]</h3><p>Shortly after King Frederick IX had delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he fell ill. At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne, becoming the first female Danish sovereign under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace 15 January 1972, by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style By the Grace of God, Queen of Denmark (Danish: Margrethe den Anden, af Guds Nåde Danmarks Dronning). The Queen chose the motto: God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.[6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said:</p><p>My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.[7]</p><h3>Constitutional role[edit]</h3><p>The Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc.</p><p>As an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.[2]</p><p>After an election where the incumbent Prime Minister does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a “Dronningerunde” (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the Danish political parties.[8]</p><p>Each party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal Det Radikale Venstre did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the Folketing, is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history that any party has held a majority on its own.)</p><p>Once the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State (privy council), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the Cabinet of Denmark.</p><p>In addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires), an infantry regiment of the British Army, following a tradition in her family.[2]</p><h3>Ruby Jubilee[edit]</h3><p>Queen Margrethe II celebrated her Ruby Jubilee, the 40th year on the throne, 14 January 2012.[9] This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace and numerous TV interviews.</p><h3>Immigration debate[edit]</h3><p>In 2016 an interview within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.[10][11]</p><h2>Personal life and interests[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official residences of the Queen and the Prince Consort are Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen and Fredensborg Palace. Their summer residence is Gråsten Palace near Sønderborg, the former home of the Queen's mother, Queen Ingrid, who died in 2000.</p><p>Margrethe is an accomplished painter, and has held many art shows over the years. Her illustrations—under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer—were used for the Danish edition of The Lord of the Rings, which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to J. R. R. Tolkien who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's poetry collection Cantabile. She is also an accomplished translator and is said to have participated in the Danish translation of The Lord of the Rings.[6] Another skill she possesses is costume designing, having designed the costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet's production of A Folk Tale and for the 2009 Peter Flinth film, De vilde svaner (The Wild Swans).[2][12] She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices. Margrethe also wears designs by former Pierre Balmain designer Erik Mortensen, Jørgen Bender, and Birgitte Taulow.[13] The Guardian in March 2013 listed her as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s.[14]</p><p>Margrethe is a chain smoker, and she is famous for her tobacco habit.[15] However, on 23 November 2006, the Danish newspaper B.T. reported an announcement from the Royal Court stating that in future the Queen would smoke only in private.[16]</p><p>A statement in a 2005 authorized biography about the Queen (entitled Margrethe) focused on her views of Islam: We are being challenged by Islam these years. Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction.[17]</p><p>Queen Margrethe II visited the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, in Nanjing, April 27, 2014. The Queen said the Memorial Hall records the darkest part of history in 77 years. We cannot change the cruel history, but can learn a historic lesson and experience from it. Today, we commemorate Sindberg. We need not only to review the past, but also need to face up to the future, she said. Margrethe II and Prince Henrik watered a tree symbolizing peace, on the square outside the Memorial Hall. They also laid down a yellow rose, named by Sindberg’s hometown as Forever Nanjing, Sindberg Yellow Rose in 2004.</p><h2>Family[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish Royal Family</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg/220px-Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Her Majesty surrounded by her family waving to crowds on her 70th birthday in April 2010.

<div class="content"><p>Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner project during the 1960s. The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight.[166] In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).[167]</p><p>The aerospace industry remains a major sector of the local economy.[168] Major aerospace companies in Bristol include BAE Systems, a merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and BAe (the latter a merger of BAC, Hawker Siddeley and Scottish Aviation). Airbus[169] and Rolls-Royce are also based at Filton, and aerospace engineering is an area of research at the University of the West of England. Another aviation company in the city is Cameron Balloons, who manufacture hot air balloons;[170] each August the city hosts the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, one of Europe's largest hot-air balloon festivals.[171]</p><p>In 2005 Bristol was named by the UK government one of England's six science cities.[172][173] A £500&nbsp;million shopping centre, Cabot Circus, opened in 2008 amidst predictions by developers and politicians that the city would become one of England's top ten retail destinations.[174] The Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries around Bristol Temple Meads railway station,[175] was announced in 2011[176] and launched the following year.[175] The 70-hectare (170-acre) Urban Enterprise Zone has streamlined planning procedures and reduced business rates. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other designated enterprise areas in the region:[177] Avonmouth, Bath, Bristol and Bath Science Park in Emersons Green, Filton, and Weston-super-Mare. Bristol is the only big city whose wealth per capita is higher than that of Britain as a whole. With a highly skilled workforce drawn from its universities, Bristol claims to have the largest cluster of computer chip designers and manufacturers outside Silicon Valley. The wider region has one of the biggest aerospace hubs in the UK, centred on Airbus, Rolls-Royce and GKN at Filton airfield.[178]</p><br><img alt="A panoramic view looking over a cityscape of office blocks, old buildings, church spires and a multi-story car park.

Some of the modern venues and modern digital production companies have merged with legacy production companies based in old buildings around the city. In 2008 the city was a finalist for the 2008 European Capital of Culture, although the title was awarded to Liverpool.[179]</p><p>The Bristol Old Vic, founded in 1946 as an offshoot of The Old Vic in London, occupies the 1766 Theatre Royal (607 seats) on King Street; the 150-seat New Vic (a studio-type theatre), and a foyer and bar in the adjacent Coopers' Hall (built in 1743). The Theatre Royal, a grade I listed building,[180][181] is the oldest continuously operating theatre in England.[182] The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (which originated in King Street) is a separate company, and the Bristol Hippodrome is a 1,951-seat theatre for national touring productions. Other smaller theatres include the Tobacco Factory, QEH, the Redgrave Theatre at Clifton College and the Alma Tavern. Bristol's theatre scene features several companies as well as the Old Vic, including Show of Strength, Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory and Travelling Light. Theatre Bristol is a partnership between the city council, Arts Council England and local residents to develop the city's theatre industry.[183] Several organisations support Bristol theatre; the Residence (an artist-led community) provides office, social and rehearsal space for theatre and performance companies,[184] and Equity has a branch in the city.[185]</p><p>The city has many venues for live music, its largest the 2,000-seat Colston Hall named after Edward Colston. Others include the Bristol Academy, The Fleece, The Croft, the Exchange, Fiddlers, the Victoria Rooms, Trinity Centre, St George's Bristol and several pubs, from the jazz-oriented The Old Duke to rock at the Fleece and indie bands at the Louisiana.[186][187] In 2010 PRS for Music called Bristol the UK's most musical city, based on the number of its members born there relative to the city's population.[188] Since the late 1970s Bristol has been home to bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, and trip hop and Bristol Sound artists such as Tricky,[189] Portishead[190] and Massive Attack;[191] the list of bands from Bristol is extensive. The city is a stronghold of drum and bass, with artists such as Roni Size's Mercury Prize-winning Reprazent,[192] as DJ Krust[193] and More Rockers.[194] This music is part of the Bristol urban-culture scene which received international media attention during the 1990s.[195]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery houses a collection encompassing natural history, archaeology, local glassware, Chinese ceramics and art. The M Shed museum opened in 2011 on the site of the former Bristol Industrial Museum.[196] Both are operated by Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, which also runs three historic houses?—?the Tudor Red Lodge, the Georgian House and Blaise Castle House?—?and Bristol Archives.[197] The 18th- and 19th-century portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, 19th-century architect Francis Greenway (designer of many of Sydney's first buildings) were born in the city. The graffiti artist Banksy is believed to be from Bristol, and many of his works are on display in the city.[198]</p><p>The Watershed Media Centre and Arnolfini gallery (both in dockside warehouses) exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema, and the city's oldest gallery is at the Royal West of England Academy in Clifton.[199] The nomadic Antlers Gallery opened in 2010, moving into empty spaces on Park Street, on Whiteladies Road and in the Purifier House on Bristol's Harbourside.[200] Stop motion animation films and commercials (produced by Aardman Animations) are made in Bristol.[201] Bristol is home to the regional headquarters of BBC West and the BBC Natural History Unit.[202] Locations in and around Bristol have featured in the BBC's natural-history programmes, including Animal Magic (filmed at Bristol Zoo).[203]</p><p>Bristol is the birthplace of 18th-century poets Robert Southey[204] and Thomas Chatterton.[205] Southey (born on Wine Street in 1774) and his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, married the Fricker sisters from the city.[206] William Wordsworth spent time in Bristol,[207] where Joseph Cottle published Lyrical Ballads in 1798. Actor Cary Grant was born in Bristol and comedians from the city include Justin Lee Collins,[208] Lee Evans,[209] Lloyd Langford,[210][211] Russell Howard[212] and writer-comedian Stephen Merchant.[213]</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Buildings and architecture of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Large, square two-storey house at the end of a dirt path" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Kings_Weston_House%2C_Bristol._The_Garden_Front._Sir_John_Vanbrugh%2C_1712.jpg/220px-Kings_Weston_House%2C_Bristol._The_Garden_Front._Sir_John_Vanbrugh%2C_1712.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Garden front of John Vanbrugh's Kings Weston House, Bristol</p><br><img alt="A seventeenth-century timber-framed building with three gables and a traditional inn sign showing a picture of a sailing barge.

During the mid-19th century Bristol Byzantine, a style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen in the city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period,[215] and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.[216]</p><p>The oldest Grade I listed buildings in Bristol are religious. St James' Priory was founded in 1129 as a Benedictine priory by Earl Robert of Gloucester, the illegitimate son of Henry I.[217] The second oldest is Bristol Cathedral and its associated Great Gatehouse.[218] Founded in 1140, the church became the seat of the bishop and cathedral of the new Diocese of Bristol in 1542. Most of the medieval stonework, particularly the Elder Lady Chapel, is made from limestone taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas.[219] Amongst the other churches included in the list is the 12th century St Mary Redcliffe which is the tallest building in Bristol. The church was described by Queen Elizabeth I as the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.[220]</p><p>Secular buildings include The Red Lodge, built in 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge for a larger house that once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in Georgian times and restored in the early 20th century.[221] St Bartholomew's Hospital is a 12th-century town house which was incorporated into a monastery hospital founded in 1240 by Sir John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr (c.?1277–1347), and became Bristol Grammar School from 1532 to 1767, and then Queen Elizabeth's Hospital 1767–1847. The round piers predate the hospital, and may come from an aisled hall, the earliest remains of domestic architecture in the city, which was then adapted to form the hospital chapel.[222] Three 17th-century town houses which were attached to the hospital were incorporated into model workers' flats in 1865, and converted to offices in 1978. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652[223] to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow[224] on King Street and the Hatchet Inn.[225]</p><p>Manor houses include Goldney Hall, where the highly decorated Grotto dates from 1739.[226] Commercial buildings such as the Exchange[227] and Old Post Office[228] from the 1740s are also included in the list. Residential buildings include the Georgian Portland Square[229] and the complex of small cottages around a green at Blaise Hamlet, which was built around 1811 for retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House.[230] The 18th-century Kings Weston House, in northern Bristol, was designed by John Vanbrugh and is the only Vanbrugh building in any UK city outside London. Almshouses[231] and pubs from the same period[232] intermingle with modern development. Several Georgian squares were designed for the middle class as prosperity increased during the 18th century.[233] During World War II, the city centre was heavily bombed during the Bristol Blitz.[234] The central shopping area near Wine Street and Castle Street was particularly hard-hit, and the Dutch House and St Peter's Hospital were destroyed. Nevertheless, in 1961 John Betjeman called Bristol the most beautiful, interesting and distinguished city in England.[235]</p><h3>Sport[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Sport in Bristol</p><p>Bristol has teams representing all the major national sports. Bristol City and Bristol Rovers are the city's main football clubs. Bristol Rugby (Rugby Union) and Gloucestershire County Cricket Club are also based in the city.</p><p>The two Football League clubs are Bristol City and Bristol Rovers?—?the former being the only club from the city to play in the precursor to the Premier League. Non-league clubs include Mangotsfield United, Bristol Manor Farm and Brislington. Bristol City, formed in 1897, were Division One runners-up in 1907 and lost the FA Cup final in 1909. In the First Division in 1976, they then sank to the bottom professional tier before reforming after a 1982 bankruptcy. Bristol City were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007, losing to Hull City in the playoff for promotion to the Premier League that season.[236]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="In the foreground twentieth century housing can be seen amidst trees and on the right a tower block of flats.

They were third-tier champions twice (Division Three South in 1952–53 and Division Three in 1989–90), Watney Cup Winners (1972) and runners-up for the Johnstone's Paint Trophy (2006–07) although have never played in England's top Division. The club has planning permission for a new 21,700-capacity all-seater stadium at the University of the West of England's Frenchay campus. Construction was due to begin in mid-2014, but in March 2015 the sale of the Memorial Stadium site (needed to finance the new stadium) was in jeopardy.[237][238] Bristol Academy Women's Football Club is based at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.[239]</p><p>The city is also home to Bristol Rugby,[240] formed in 1888 as Bristol Football Club by the merger of the Carlton club with rival Redland Park. Westbury Park declined the merger and folded, with many of its players joining Bristol.[241] Bristol Rugby has often competed at the highest level of the sport since its formation in 1888.[242] The club played at the Memorial Ground, which it shared with Bristol Rovers from 1996. Although Bristol Rugby owned the stadium when the football club arrived, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes led to a transfer of ownership to Bristol Rovers. In 2014 Bristol Rugby moved to their new home, Ashton Gate Stadium (home to Bristol Rovers' rivals Bristol City), for the 2014–15 season.[243][244] Dating from 1901, the Bristol Combination and its 53 clubs promote rugby union in the city and help support Bristol Rugby.[245] The most prominent of Bristol's smaller rugby clubs include Clifton Rugby, Dings Crusaders, and Cleve. Rugby league is represented in Bristol by the Bristol Sonics.[246]</p><p>The first-class cricket club Gloucestershire County Cricket Club[247] has its headquarters and plays the majority of its home games at the Bristol County Ground, the only major international sports venue in the south west of England. It was formed by the family of W. G. Grace.[248] The club is arguably Bristol's most successful, achieving a period of success between 1999 and 2006 when it won nine trophies and became the most formidable one-day outfit in England, including winning a double double in 1999 and 2000 (both the Benson and Hedges Cup and the C&amp;G Trophy), and the Sunday League in 2000. Gloucestershire CCC also won the Royal London One-Day Cup in 2015.</p><p>The Bristol Flyers basketball team have competed in the British Basketball League, the UK's premier professional basketball league, since 2014.[249] Bristol Aztecs play in Britain's premier American football competition, the BAFA National Leagues.[250] In 2009 ice hockey returned to Bristol after a 17-year absence, with the Bristol Pitbulls playing at Bristol Ice Rink; after its closure, it shared a venue with Oxford City Stars.[251] Bristol sponsors an annual half marathon and hosted the 2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.[252] Athletic clubs in Bristol include Bristol and West AC, Bitton Road Runners and Westbury Harriers. Bristol has staged finishes and starts of the Tour of Britain cycle race[253] and facilities in the city were used as training camps for the 2012 London Olympics.[254] The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, a major UK hot-air ballooning event, is held each summer at Ashton Court.[255]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="A large number of hot air balloons taking off from a field which is surrounded by tents and stalls.

These include nature documentaries, including The Blue Planet and Planet Earth. The city has a long association with David Attenborough's authored documentaries, including Life on Earth.[256]</p><p>Bristol has two daily newspapers, the Western Daily Press and the Bristol Post; a weekly free newspaper, the Bristol Observer; and a Bristol edition of the free Metro newspaper. All are owned by the Trinity Mirror Group. The Bristol Mercury was published from 1716 and 1909.[257]</p><p>The city has several radio stations, including BBC Radio Bristol. Bristol's television productions include Points West for BBC West, Endemol productions such as Deal or No Deal, The Crystal Maze, and ITV News West Country for ITV West &amp; Wales (formerly HTV West) and ITV Westcountry. The hospital drama Casualty, formerly filmed in Bristol, moved to Cardiff in 2012.[258]</p><p>Publishers in the city have included 18th-century Bristolian Joseph Cottle, who helped introduce Romanticism by publishing the works of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.[259] During the 19th century, J.W. Arrowsmith published the Victorian comedies Three Men in a Boat (by Jerome K. Jerome) and The Diary of a Nobody by George and Weedon Grossmith.[260] The contemporary Redcliffe Press has published over 200 books covering all aspects of th<br>

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The coat of arms of Greenland is a blue shield featuring a silver polar bear. This symbol was first introduced in the coat of arms of Denmark in 1666[1] and it is still represented in the arms of the Danish royal family. In a Danish context, the bear was originally shown walking naturally, but an upright position was specified in 1819. The 1470 London Roll shows an arms captioned Le Roy de Greneland featuring a shield depicting a polar bear surrounded by three birds. This royal title did not reflect any official title, but merely that the arms could be used by anyone controlling Greenland.[2]</p><p>The version currently used by the government of Greenland was designed by Greenlandic artist Jens Rosing and adopted on May 1, 1989 by the Landsting. The polar bear symbolizes the fauna of Greenland and the blue (azure) colour designates the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean Greenland is washed by. Instead of the Danish version in the royal arms which follows the heraldic tradition in raising the right forepaw, the polar bear on the Greenlandic coat of arms raises the left forepaw, due to the traditional Inuit belief that polar bears are left-handed.[3] A similar arms is used by the official Danish government representative in Greenland. In this case, the bear raises its right paw, and the shield is crowned with the royal crown.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official Danish specification of the arms does not specify which forepaw is raised, so there is no conflict between the different versions.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Nuuk (Greenlandic pronunciation:&nbsp;[nu?k]; Danish: Godthåb)[2] is the capital and largest city of Greenland and the municipality of Sermersooq. It is the seat of government and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains almost a third of Greenland's population, and also has the tallest building in Greenland. Nuuk is the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2016, it had a population of 17,316,[3] making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population.</p><p>Nuuk is the Kalaallisut word for cape. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°10' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, located only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. Since 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the new Sermersooq municipality,[4] linking the town centre with the outlying districts and neighborhoods[5] of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa.[6] In 2012 the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk. The campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland, and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland[7] is located at the northern end of the district, near the road to the Nuuk Airport.[8]</p><p>Nuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[9][10]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq.[11] For a long time it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Viking explorers in the 10th century (Western Settlement), and shortly thereafter by Inuit peoples.[12] Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the Norse settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Egede_nuuk.JPG/200px-Egede_nuuk.JPG" width="200" height="134"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The statue of Hans Egede in Nuuk.</p><p>The city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony (Haabets Koloni) from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Danish colony under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[13] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[14] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[15] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940 when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[16]</p><p>In 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (Danish: Nye-Hernhut). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864),[17] before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.[18]</p><p>Around 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and perceived the Greenlanders had lost much of their culture and identity under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the Atuagagdliutt, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became significant for the Greenlandic identity.</p><p>During World War II, there was a reawakening to Greenlandic national identity. Greenlanders shared a written language and assembled a council under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. Under new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernise Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[19]</p><p>An article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[20] suggested worldwide,</p><p>One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland’s population of 58,000 is Inuit, and least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[20]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>See also: Nuup Kangerlua</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Godthaabsfjord.jpg/200px-Godthaabsfjord.jpg" width="200" height="134"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Nuukair.jpg/200px-Nuukair.jpg" width="200" height="133"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Left: Satellite view.

Some 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) to the northeast, reaching a height of 1,210&nbsp;m (3,970&nbsp;ft), Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper Sermitsiaq. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, 790&nbsp;m (2,590&nbsp;ft), and Lille Malene, 420&nbsp;m (1,380&nbsp;ft).[24] The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.[25][26]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>Nuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen ET) with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. On 22 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 and sets at 14:20. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 03:00 and does not set until 00:00.

There are a few planted trees[30] which do not sustain well.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>With 16,992 inhabitants as of 2015[update], Nuuk is by far the largest and fastest growing town in Greenland. Despite an overall decline in the country's population, there was an increase of 174 from 2014 to 2015.[31] Nuuk, Paamiut[citation needed] and Tasiilaq are the only towns in the Sermersooq commune (a third of Greenland) which have grown steadily over the last two decades. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, 3,636 were born outside the country.[32] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[33] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[24]</p><h2>Government and politics[edit]</h2><p>As the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative centre of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[24]</p><p>As of December 2015, the mayor of Nuuk is Asii Chemnitz Narup. She is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[34]</p><p>Greenland's Self Government Parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms.[35] All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women's Party.[36]</p><h3>KANUKOKA[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: KANUKOKA</p><p>KANUKOKA (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaanni Kommunit Kattuffiat) is based in Nuuk.

It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbour but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[40] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US $7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[24] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.</p><p>The city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[41]</p><h3>Energy[edit]</h3><p>All of Greenland's electricity is powered by the government owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[42] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[43][44]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg/220px-Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg" width="220" height="88"><br><p>University of Greenland</p><p>Nuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning.

"Ethnicities" redirects here. It is not to be confused with the academic journal.</p><p>An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral, language, social, cultural or national experiences.[1][2] Ethnicity is often an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. In some cases, it can be adopted if a person moves into another society[citation needed]. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, and physical appearance.</p><p>Ethnic groups, derived from the same historical founder population, often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to leave one ethnic group and become part of another (except for ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity as a key membership criterion).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Ethnicity is often used synonymously with ambiguous terms such as nation or people. In English, it can also have the connotation of something exotic (cf. White ethnic, ethnic restaurant, etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the founding population of an area was established.</p><p>The largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals (Han Chinese being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as tribes or clans, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity, and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Nileshwar_22.jpg/220px-Nileshwar_22.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Ethnic saris in Kerala</p><p>The term ethnic is derived from the Greek word ????? ethnos (more precisely, from the adjective ??????? ethnikos,[3] which was loaned into Latin as ethnicus). The inherited English language term for this concept is folk, used alongside the latinate people since the late Middle English period.</p><p>In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, ethnic was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate nations which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used ta ethne (the nations) to translate the Hebrew goyim the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews.[4] The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a host of men, a band of comrades as well as a swarm or flock of animals. In Classical Greek, the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by ethnic group, mostly translated as nation, people; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to foreign or barbarous nations in particular (whence the later meaning heathen, pagan).[5]</p><p>In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of peculiar to a race, people or nation, in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of different cultural groups, and in American English racial, cultural or national minority group arises in the 1930s to 1940s,[6] serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. The abstract ethnicity had been used for paganism in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an ethnic character (first recorded 1953). The term ethnic group was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.[7] Depending on the context that is used, the term nationality may either be used synonymously with ethnicity, or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950.</p><p>Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In many cases – for instance, the sense of Jewish peoplehood&nbsp;– more than one aspect determines membership.</p><h2>Definitions and conceptual history[edit]</h2><p>Ethnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus in ca. 480 BC laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own ethnicity, which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating</p><li>shared descent (?µa?µ?? - homaimon, of the same blood),[8]</li><li>shared language (?µ????ss?? - homoglosson, speaking the same language)[9]</li><li>shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: ?e?? ?d??µat? te ????? ?a? ??s?a? - theon hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)[10]</li><li>shared customs (Greek: ??ea ?µ?t??pa - ethea homotropa, customs of like fashion).[11][12][13]</li><p>Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. According to Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality, in Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics and Reality&nbsp;: Proceedings of the Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, April 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, Department of Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993,[14] a conference organised by Statistics Canada and the United States Census Bureau (April 1–3, 1992).[15] Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16][irrelevant citation]</p><p>According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.</p><p>According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.[25]</p><p>Max Weber maintained that ethnic groups were künstlich (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called race.[26]</p><p>Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose Ethnic Groups and Boundaries from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s.[27] Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical a prioris to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: ...&nbsp;categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.</p><p>In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of ethnic groups in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>...&nbsp;the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed.[27]</p><p>In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as cultural or tribal when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that ethnicity had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning ethnic identity (like earlier claims concerning tribal identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.[27]</p><p>According to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:</p><p>[C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.[28]</p><p>Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.[29] Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness.[27] He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) Ethnicity&nbsp;... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.[27] This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.</p><h3>Approaches to understanding ethnicity[edit]</h3><p>Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. Examples of such approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.</p><p>Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16] Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.[36]</p><p>Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to boundary markers - characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.[37][38][39][40][41]</p><h3>Ethnicity theory[edit]</h3><p>Ethnicity theory says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification.[42] This theory was put forth by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of “culture”.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This theory was preceded by over a century where biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation of scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used was the measurement of cranial capacity.[43]</p><p>Ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture.</p><p>Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country.[44] While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process&nbsp;– contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation&nbsp;– it did so only for white ethnic communities.[44] The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact.</p><p>And assimilation&nbsp;– shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture&nbsp;– did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others.[44] Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities.[45] It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.[46] In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a “benign neglect” of social inequality.[46]</p><h2>Ethnicity and nationality[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Nation state and minority group</p><p>In some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner[47] and Benedict Anderson[48] see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of nation-states in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries. Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.</p><p>In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent nations. Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state.[49] Under these conditions&nbsp;– when people moved from one state to another,[50] or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries&nbsp;– ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Multi-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation state. Examples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, which were ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed multicultural societies especially in large cities.</p><p>The states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.</p><p>In recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis)[51] have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent.[52] It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviours that belong to a specific collectivity.[53] Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne.</p><h2>Ethnicity and race[edit]</h2><p>Race and ethnicity are considered to be related concepts. Ethnicity is often assumed to be somewhat more of a cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language and cultural tradition, while race is assumed to be strictly a biological classification, based on DNA and bone structure. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to its common political use. It is assumed that, based on power relations, there exist 'racialized ethnicities' and 'ethnicized races'. Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.[54]</p><p>Before Weber, race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity was predominant: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.[55] With Weber's introduction of the view of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.</p><p>In 1950, the UNESCO statement, The Race Question, signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), suggested that: National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'.[56]</p><p>In 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:</p><p>The opposing interests that divide the working classes are further reinforced through appeals to racial and ethnic distinctions. Such appeals serve to allocate different categories of workers to rungs on the scale of labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations to the lower levels and insulating the higher echelons from competition from below. Capitalism did not create all the distinctions of ethnicity and race that function to set off categories of workers from one another. It is, nevertheless, the process of labor mobilization under capitalism that imparts to these distinctions their effective values.[57]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.[58]</p><p>Writing about the usage of the term ethnic in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, in 1977 Wallman noted that</p><p>The term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' in Britain, only less precisely, and with a lighter value load. In North America, by contrast, '[race]' most commonly means color, and 'ethnics' are the descendants of relatively recent immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. '[Ethnic]' is not a noun in Britain. In effect there are no 'ethnics'; there are only 'ethnic relations'.[59]</p><p>In the U.S., the OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not scientific or anthropological and takes into account social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry, using appropriate scientific methodologies that are not primarily biological or genetic in reference.[60]</p><h2>Ethno-national conflict[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Ethnic conflict</p><p>Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like Jürgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.</p><p>The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.</p><h2>Ethnic groups by continent[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Africa</p><p>Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture.</p><p>Many ethnic groups and nations of Africa qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society. These mostly originate with the Sahelian kingdoms of the medieval period, such as that of the Akan, deriving from Bonoman (11th century) then the Kingdom of Ashanti (17th century).[61]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Asia</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Assyriankhigga.jpg/230px-Assyriankhigga.jpg" width="230" height="153"><br><p>The Assyrians are the indigenous peoples of Northern Iraq.</p><p>There is an abundance of ethnic groups throughout Asia, with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical.

Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The term Danish Realm (Danish: Det Danske Rige[14][15]) refers to the relationship between Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland—three countries constituting the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>The legal nature of the Kingdom of Denmark is fundamentally one of a unitary sovereign state. The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been part of the Crown of Denmark since 1397 (de jure) when the Kalmar Union was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (de facto). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an extensive type of self-government and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields.[16]</p><p>Legal matters in The Danish Realm are subject to the Danish Constitution.[17] Beginning in 1953, state law issues within The Danish Realm has been governed by The Unity of the Realm (Danish: Rigsenheden).[18][19][20][21] A less formal name for The Unity of the Realm is the Commonwealth of the Realm.[13] In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as rigsfællesskabet. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both The Unity of The Realm and The Danish Realm itself has increasingly been referred to as simply rigsfællesskabet (Faroese: ríkisfelagsskapurin; Greenlandic: naalagaaffeqatigiit) in daily parlance.[18]</p><p>The Danish Constitution stipulates that the foreign and security interests for all parts of the Danish Realm are the responsibility of the Danish government. The Faroes received home rule in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received self rule, thus leaving the Danish government with virtually no influence over Greenlandic internal affairs.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Constitutionality[edit]</h2><p>The Danish Realm's unique state of internal affairs is acted out in the principle of The Unity of the Realm.[19] This principle is derived from Article 1 of the Danish Constitution which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.[22] The Constitutional Act specifies that sovereignty is to continue to be exclusively with the authorities of the Realm (the Danish government and parliament). Faroese or Greenlandic self-governance cannot be established by international treaties but must be established by Danish law; the Danish parliament (the Folketing) delegates a precisely defined part of its competence to the home rule authorities.[23]</p><p>The language of Denmark is Danish, and the Danish state authorities are based in Denmark. The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, Copenhagen. Two of the parliament's members are elected in each of Greenland and the Faroe Islands; the remaining 175 members are elected in Denmark. The Government ministries are located in Copenhagen, as is the highest court, the Supreme Court.[22]</p><h2>Devolved powers[edit]</h2><p>See also: Home rule, Politics of the Faroe Islands, and Politics of Greenland</p><p>In principle, the Danish Realm constitutes a unified sovereign state, with equal status between its constituent parts.[13] Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains de jure unitary.</p><p>The Self-Government Arrangements devolves political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and the Greenlandic political authorities. The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks. The Danish government provides an annual grant to the Faroese and the Greenlandic authorities to cover the costs of these devolved areas.[16]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Tinganes.jpg/220px-Tinganes.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Tinganes, in the capital Tórshavn, is the location of the Faroese Home Government.</p><p>The 1948 Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands sets out the terms of Faroese home rule. The Act states, ...the Faroe Islands shall constitute a self-governing community within the State of Denmark.[1] It establishes the home government of the Faroe Islands (Landsstýrið) and the Faroese parliament, the Løgting. More significantly, the Act specifies the powers devolved from the Government of Denmark, including: local government and municipal affairs; taxation, at a local and territorial level; public services, including police and town planning; welfare services, such as housing; primary and secondary education; Archives, libraries, museums; agriculture and fishing; entertainment; among other areas.[1] The Faroe Islands were previously administered as a Danish county (amt); the Home Rule Act abolished the post of Amtmand (County Governor) and replaced it with the role of Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner to the Danish government).[1] These powers were expanded in a 2005 Act, which named the Faroese home government as an equal partner with the Danish government.[24]</p><p>The 1978 Greenland Home Rule Act devolves powers in much the same way as the Faroese Home Rule Act. It sets out a home rule government and Greenlandic parliament. Specific areas of governance specified in the act include: Organization of local government; Fishing and agriculture; Welfare system; protection of the environment; other areas affecting Greenlanders directly, etc.[2]</p><p>On 21 June 2009, Greenland assumed self-determination with responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, natural resources, immigration and border controls. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[25] Greenland is now described as having self rule, with its home government exercising a wider range of powers.</p><p>There are a number of matters that can not be acquired by the territories; Constitutional affairs, foreign policy, defence, the Supreme Court, citizenship, and monetary policy. Additionally, the Faroese and Greenlandic parliaments are subordinate to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Denmark, where the two territories are represented by two seats each (from a total of 179 seats).</p><h2>Legal status[edit]</h2><p>The Faroe Islands and Greenland have two seats each (out of 179) in the Danish parliament, Folketinget[26] The arrangement between the areas of the Realm is sometimes described as constituent countries. Greenland's powers of self-government were increased in 2009 through the Greenland Self-Rule Act, which established the Greenlanders as a separate national people under international law, while the Faroe Islands have gradually taken control of more and more areas according to their Home Rule Act from 1948.[27] The Faroese/Danish act of 2005 states This law is based on an agreement between the Governments of the Faroe Islands and Denmark as equal partners.[28] Despite this principle of unity among the three territories, some commentators consider the Danish Realm as a federation or a sui generis legal construction. In the opinion of Bogi Eliasen, the Kingdom of Denmark is not a unitary state but a structure with some federative elements of divided power.[13] Danish justice Frederik Harhoff states that the Kingdom of Denmark is neither a federation (since it lacks a treaty to this effect), nor is it a confederation[13] But the home rules are limited to internal matters only. Greenland or the Faroe Islands cannot write laws which concern the relationship with other states, nor laws that applies to the entire Realm, and the Supreme Court (Danish: Højesteret) in Copenhagen is the final legal instance (and legal matters from Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be prepared for that court, like any Danish matter). Danish currency is also legal tender and Denmark is responsible for the military defense.[29] Further, for rare treatments and certain surgery, Greenlanders and Faraoses are often directed to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>International community[edit]</h3><p>See also: Foreign relations of Denmark</p><p>Previously, most foreign relations were undertaken by the Government of Denmark exclusively on behalf of the entire realm, but more recently the Faroe Islands and Greenland have increased their role in the foreign policy. Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the Thule Air Base in northwest Greenland.</p><p>The Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the OECD and the World Trade Organization. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the Nordic Council in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the European Union, both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but opted to leave in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.</p><p>The Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a national of Denmark and a resident of the Faroe Islands.[1] The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular Danish passport as well. The Faroese Home Rule Act states that, in Faroese passports, Føroyingur (Faroese) and Føroyar (Faroe Islands) shall be inserted after the words Dansk (Danish) and Danmark (Denmark).[1]</p><h2>Population and area[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Geography of Denmark, Geography of Greenland, and Geography of the Faroe Islands</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg/300px-Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg.png" width="300" height="213"><br><p>Comparison map: Greenland, the Faroe Islands (enlarged) and Denmark differ significantly in size. The Danish Realm is spread far apart, across the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea.</p><p>The size of the Danish population is far greater than the population size of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper has a population of about 5.6 million people, while the populations of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are 48,000 and 56,000 people, respectively. A medium-sized Danish provincial town has, for comparison, a population of about 50,000. With an area of over two million km² (836,109 square miles), Greenland is the most sparsely populated territory in the world.</p><p>The disparity between the small population of the former colonies and the greater population of Denmark proper has helped to enforce the hegemonial position that Denmark proper holds in the Realm. When the areas of the three territories are combined, the Kingdom of Denmark ranks as the twelfth largest country in the world, the same rank held by Greenland alone.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><p>Hjemmestyre
Meaning "home rule", it indicates an autonomous administration (present in both in Greenland and the Faroe Islands) that has power over all internal affairs. In this arrangement, the Danish government deals only with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with "self-governing."


Selvstyre
Following a referendum on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.[32] As a result of these changes Greenland was now said to have self rule with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to "home rule".


Rigsombudsmand
High Commissioners represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each country. He or she can attend the meetings at the Løgting in the Faroes and at the Inatsisartut in Greenland, but they can't vote.


Folketingsmedlemmer fra Færøerne og Grønland
Members of Folketing from the Faroe Islands and Greenland: Greenland and the Faroe Islands and their self-rule administrations take part in consultations on policies and decisions affecting their region, including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the Danish parliament (Folketing). They have two members each, and these are full members of the Danish Folketing and are allowed to vote.


Countries
Mirroring the terminology of the United Kingdom or the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Greenland, Denmark and the Faroes are sometimes referred to as countries within the sovereign state of the Kingdom of Denmark. However, such usage is inconsistent; whilst Denmark proper may be referred to as a country, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are officially referred to as "self-governing territories".[33] Additionally, the recent law granting Greenland "self rule" in 2008 refers to Greenland as "a people", but not a country.[34]</p><h2>Literature[edit]</h2><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><h2>Sources[edit]</h2><p>Find more aboutKingdom of Denmarkat Wikipedia's sister projects

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>A constitutional monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution.[1] Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.</p><p>A constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution, whether written or unwritten.[2] While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarch's name, in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets public policy or chooses political leaders. Political scientist Vernon Bogdanor, paraphrasing Thomas Macaulay, has defined a constitutional monarch as a sovereign who reigns but does not rule.[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In addition to acting as a visible symbol of national unity, a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as dissolving parliament or giving royal assent to legislation. However, the exercise of such powers is largely strictly in accordance with either written constitutional principles or unwritten constitutional conventions, rather than any personal political preference imposed by the sovereign. In The English Constitution, British political theorist Walter Bagehot identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch may freely exercise: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. Many constitutional monarchies still retain significant authorities or political influence however, such as through certain reserve powers, and may also play an important political role.</p><p>The United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms are all constitutional monarchies in the Westminster tradition of constitutional governance. Three states&nbsp;– Malaysia, Cambodia and the Holy See&nbsp;– are elective monarchies, wherein the ruler is periodically selected by a small electoral college.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The oldest constitutional monarchy dating back to ancient times was that of the Hittites. They were an ancient Anatolian people that lived during the Bronze Age whose king or queen had to share their authority with an assembly, called Panku, equivalent to a modern-day deliberative assembly of a legislature. These were scattered noble families that worked as representatives of their subjects in an adjutant or subaltern federal-type landscape.[4][5]</p><p>The most recent[update] country to move from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy was Bhutan, between 2007 and 2008 (see Politics of Bhutan, Constitution of Bhutan and Bhutanese democracy).</p><h2>Constitutional and absolute monarchy[edit]</h2><h3>England and the United Kingdom[edit]</h3><p>In the Kingdom of England, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, although limits on the power of the monarch ('a limited monarchy') are much older than that (see Magna Carta). At the same time, in Scotland the Convention of Estates enacted the Claim of Right Act 1689, which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy.</p><p>Although Queen Anne was the last monarch to veto an Act of Parliament when in 1707 she blocked the Scottish Militia Bill, Hanoverian monarchs continued to selectively dictate government policies. For instance George III constantly blocked Catholic Emancipation, eventually precipitating the resignation of William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister in 1801.[6] The sovereign's influence on the choice of Prime Minister gradually declined over this period, William IV being the last monarch to dismiss a Prime Minister, when in 1834 he removed Lord Melbourne as a result of Melbourne's choice of Lord John Russell as Leader of the House of Commons.[7][8] Queen Victoria was the last monarch to exercise real personal power but this diminished over the course of her reign. In 1839 she became the last sovereign to keep a Prime Minister in power against the will of Parliament when the Bedchamber crisis resulted in the retention of Lord Melbourne's administration.[9] By the end of her reign, however, she could do nothing to block the unacceptable (to her) premierships of William Gladstone, although she still exercised power in appointments to the Cabinet, for example in 1886 preventing Gladstone's choice of Hugh Childers as War Secretary in favor of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.[10]</p><p>Today, the role of the British monarch is by convention effectively ceremonial.[11] Instead, the British Parliament and the Government – chiefly in the office of Prime Minister – exercise their powers under 'Royal (or Crown) Prerogative': on behalf of the monarch and through powers still formally possessed by the Monarch.[12][13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>No person may accept significant public office without swearing an oath of allegiance to the Queen.[14] With few exceptions, the monarch is bound by constitutional convention to act on the advice of the Government.</p><h3>Continental Europe[edit]</h3><p>Constitutional monarchy originated in continental Europe, with Poland developing the first constitution for a monarchy with the Constitution of May 3, 1791; it was the third constitution in the world just after the first republican Constitution of the United States. Constitutional monarchy also occurred briefly in the early years of the French Revolution, but much more widely afterwards. Napoleon Bonaparte is considered the first monarch proclaiming himself as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, in his work Elements of the Philosophy of Right (1820), gave the concept a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law.[15] Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan.[16]</p><h2>Modern constitutional monarchy[edit]</h2><p>As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was head of the executive branch and quite a powerful figure even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have envisioned the president as an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was then understood, following Montesquieu's account of the separation of powers.[17]</p><p>The present-day concept of a constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the prime minister, exercise power, with the monarchs having ceded power and remaining as a titular position. In many cases the monarchs, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of servants of the people to reflect the new, egalitarian position. In the course of France's July Monarchy, Louis-Philippe I was styled King of the French rather than King of France.</p><p>Following the Unification of Germany, Otto von Bismarck rejected the British model. In the constitutional monarchy established under the Constitution of the German Empire which Bismarck inspired, the Kaiser retained considerable actual executive power, while the Imperial Chancellor needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Later, Fascist Italy could also be considered as a constitutional monarchy, in that there was a king as the titular head of state while actual power was held by Benito Mussolini under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.</p><p>Nowadays a parliamentary democracy that is a constitutional monarchy is considered to differ from one that is a republic only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected Members of Parliament.</p><p>However, three important factors distinguish monarchies such as the United Kingdom from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with Parliament. These are: the Royal Prerogative under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited circumstances; Sovereign Immunity under which the monarch may do no wrong under the law because the responsible government is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use restrictions as most citizens. Other privileges may be nominal or ceremonial (e.g., where the executive, judiciary, police or armed forces act on the authority of or owe allegiance to the Crown).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today slightly more than a quarter of constitutional monarchies are Western European countries, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Luxembourg, Monaco, Liechtenstein and Sweden. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In these countries the prime minister holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the monarch retains residual (but not always insignificant) powers. The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a coalition government following a parliamentary election, while in Norway the King chairs special meetings of the cabinet.</p><p>In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the Cabinet. Only a few monarchies (most notably Japan and Sweden) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.</p><p>There are sixteen constitutional monarchies under Queen Elizabeth II, which are known as Commonwealth realms.[18] Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant reserve or prerogative powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises, usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor-General exercising such power occurred during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills. On November 11, 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he sought the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition Malcolm Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether Australia should become a republic. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy, however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by the constitution, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.</p><p>In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The former King, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was the longest reigning monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history, prior to passing away on 13 October 2016.[19] Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in Thai Politics.) Among the powers retained by the monarch under the constitution, lèse majesté protects the image of the monarch and enables him to play a role in politics. It carries strict criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence arises from this reverence and from the socio-economic improvement efforts undertaken by the royal family.</p><p>In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a frequent debate centers on when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favor of a partisan goal, while some political scientists champion the idea of an interventionist monarch as a check against possible illegal action by politicians. For instance, the monarch of the United Kingdom can theoretically exercise an absolute veto over legislation by withholding royal assent. However, no monarch has done so since 1708, and it is widely believed that this and many of the monarch's other political powers are lapsed powers.</p><p>There are currently 44 monarchies, and most of them are constitutional monarchies.</p><h2>List of current constitutional monarchies[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

One of the animals found here is the polar bear, which is on the coat of arms of the Danish royal family in Greenland</p><p>The history of Greenland is a history of life under extreme Arctic conditions: currently, an ice cap covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.</p><p>The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental North America. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when Icelandic Vikings settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the Inuit Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around 1200 AD, from northwestern Greenland. While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the Little Ice Age, the early Norse settlements along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, Denmark-Norway, apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a colonial power, Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to paganism. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.</p><p>During World War II, when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the United States and Canada.[1] After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas amt (county). Although Greenland is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it has enjoyed home rule since 1979. In 1985, the island decided to leave the European Union, which it had joined as a part of Denmark in 1973; the Faroes had never joined.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early Paleo-Eskimo cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png/200px-Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png" width="200" height="764"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Arctic cultures in and around Greenland, 900-1500</p><p>The prehistory of Greenland is a story of repeated waves of Paleo-Eskimo immigration from the islands north of the North American mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of Siberia who migrated into Canada thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. Archaeology can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.</p><p>The earliest known cultures in Greenland are the Saqqaq culture (2500–800 BC) [2] and the Independence I culture in northern Greenland (2400–1300 BCE). The practitioners of these two cultures are thought to have descended from separate groups that came to Greenland from northern Canada.[3] Around 800 BCE, the so-called Independence II culture arose in the region where the Independence I culture had previously existed.[4] it was originally thought that Independence II was succeeded by Dorset culture (700 BC–200 AD), but some Independence II artefacts date from as recently as the 1st century BCE. Recent studies suggest that, in Greenland at least, the Dorset culture may be better understood as a continuation of Independence II culture; the two cultures have therefore been designated Greenlandic Dorset. Artefacts associated with early Dorset culture in Greenland have been found as far north as Inglefield Land on the west coast and the Dove Bugt area on the east coast.[5]</p><p>After the Early Dorset culture disappeared around 200 AD, the island was uninhabited for several centuries.[5] The next immigrants to arrive from Canada, perhaps as early as 800, settled the northwest part of the island, bringing with them the so-called Late Dorset culture, which survived until about 1300.[6] The Norse arrived and settled in the southern part of the island in 980.</p><h2>Norse settlement[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg/220px-I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg" width="220" height="138"><br><p>Summer in the Greenland coast circa year 1000
Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen (1841–1893)</p><p>Europeans became aware of Greenland's existence, probably in the early 10th century, when Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, sailing from Norway to Iceland, was blown off course by a storm, and happened to sight some islands off Greenland. During the 980s, explorers led by Erik the Red set out from Iceland and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and settled there. Erik named the island Greenland (Grœnland in Old Norse, Grænland in modern Icelandic, Grønland in modern Danish and Norwegian) in effect as a marketing device. Both the Book of Icelanders (Íslendingabók, a medieval account of Icelandic history from the 12th century onward) and the Saga of Eric the Red (Eiríks saga rauða, a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland) state He named the land Greenland, saying that people would be eager to go there if it had a good name.[7]</p><p>The Norse established their settlements along fjords (such as the Tunuliarfik and Aniaaq fjords in the central area of the Eastern settlement). Because this was during the so-called Medieval Warm Period, the vegetation there was very different from what it is today. Excavations have shown that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4 to 6 metre tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush.[8][unreliable source?][9][unreliable source?] The Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for three years for committing murder.[10] He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.[11] This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at Brattahlid (now Qassiarsuk), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, Leif Eirikson, left the settlement to explore the regions around Vinland, which is generally assumed to have been located in what is now Newfoundland.</p><p>The Norse settled in three separate locations: the larger Eastern settlement, the smaller Western settlement, and the still smaller Middle Settlement (often considered part of the Eastern one). The settlements at their height are estimated to have had a population of between 2,000 and 10,000 people, with more recent estimates[12] tending toward the lower figure. Ruins of approximately 620 farms have been identified: 500 in the Eastern settlement, 95 in the Western settlement, and 20 in the Middle. The settlements carried on a trade in ivory from walrus tusks with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides according to one 13th-century account. They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal Labrador), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late 13th century, all ships from Greenland were required by law to sail directly to Norway. The climate also became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the Little Ice Age.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Hvalsey_Church.jpg/200px-Hvalsey_Church.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Hvalsey Church</p><p>In 1126, a diocese was founded at Garðar (now Igaliku). It was subject to the Norwegian archdiocese of Nidaros (now Trondheim); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261, the population accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King as well, although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements declined in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350. In 1378, there was no longer a bishop at Garðar. The last written record of the Norse Greenlanders is of a marriage, in 1408, in Hvalsey Church, which still stands today; although in ruins, it is the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.</p><p>After 1408 not many written records mention the settlers. There is correspondence between the Pope and the Biskop Bertold af Garde from the same year.[13] The Danish Cartographer Claudius Clavus seems to have visited Greenland in 1420, according to documents written by Nicolas Germanus and Henricus Martellus who had access to original cartographic notes and a map by Clavus. Two mathematical manuscripts containing the second chart of the Claudius Clavus map from his journey to Greenland, where he himself mapped the area, were found during the late 20th century by the Danish scholar Bjönbo and Petersen.[14]</p><p>In a letter dated 1448 from Rome, Pope Nicholas V prescribed the bishops of Skálholt and Hólar (the two Icelandic episcopal sees) to ensure to provide the inhabitants of Greenland with priests and a bishop, the latter of which they hadn't had in the 30 years since the apparent coming of the heathens when most churches were destroyed and the people taken away as prisoners.[15]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the middle of the 15th century although no exact date has been established.</p><h2>Norse failure[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Grtemp.png" width="355" height="173"><p>A graphical description of changes in temperature in Greenland from 500&nbsp;– 1990 based on analysis of the deep ice core from Greenland and some historical events.

Among the factors that have been suggested as contributing to the demise of the Greenland colony are:[16][17]</p><p>Numerous studies have tested these hypotheses and some have led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.[citation needed] The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.[18]</p><p>Greenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation.[19] A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food.[19] But they never learned to use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.[19]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>To investigate the possibility of climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples. The oxygen isotopes from the ice caps suggested that the Medieval Warm Period had caused a relatively milder climate in Greenland, lasting from roughly 800 to 1200. However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, the Little Ice Age had reached intense levels in Greenland.[20] Excavations of middens from the Viking farms in both Greenland and Iceland show the shift from the bones of cows and pigs to those of sheep and goats. As the winters lengthened, and the springs and summers shortened, there must have been less and less time for Greenlanders to grow hay. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century—as much as 6-8&nbsp;°C lower than modern summer temperatures.[21] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. By the mid-14th century deposits from a chieftain’s farm showed a large number of cattle and caribou remains, whereas, a poorer farm only several kilometers away had no trace of domestic animal remains, only seal. Bone samples from Greenland Norse cemeteries confirm that the typical Greenlander diet had increased by this time from 20% sea animals to 80%.[22]</p><p>Although Greenland seems to have been uninhabited at the time of initial Norse settlement, the Thule people migrated south and finally came into contact with the Norse in the 12th century. There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as skræling. The Icelandic Annals are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.[23] Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference—an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them—or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.[citation needed]</p><p>The Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of kayak navigation or ring seal hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement. By 1350, the Norse had completely deserted their Western Settlement.[24] The Inuit, being a hunting society, may have hunted the Norse livestock, forcing the Norse into conflict or abandonment of their settlements.[citation needed]</p><p>In mild weather conditions, a ship could make the 900-mile (1400 kilometers) trip from Iceland to Eastern Settlement within a couple of weeks. Greenlanders had to keep in contact with Iceland and Norway in order to trade. Little is known about any distinctive shipbuilding techniques among the Greenlanders. Greenland lacks a supply of lumber, so was completely dependent on Icelandic merchants or, possibly, logging expeditions to the Canadian coast.[citation needed]</p><p>The sagas mention Icelanders traveling to Greenland to trade.[25] Settlement chieftains and large farm owners controlled this trade. Chieftains would trade with the foreign ships and then disperse the goods by trading with the surrounding farmers.[26] The Greenlanders' main commodity was the walrus tusk,[16] which was used primarily in Europe as a substitute for elephant ivory for art décor, whose trade had been blocked by conflict with the Islamic world. Professor Gudmundsson suggests a very valuable narwhal tusk trade, through a smuggling route between western Iceland and the Orkney islands.[citation needed]</p><p>It has been argued that the royal Norwegian monopoly on shipping contributed to the end of trade and contact. However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the Herjolfsnes church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding. Most had crucifixes around their necks with their arms crossed as in a stance of prayer. Roman papal records report that the Greenlanders were excused from paying their tithes in 1345 because the colony was suffering from poverty.[27] The last reported ship to reach Greenland was a private ship that was blown off course, reaching Greenland in 1406, and departing in 1410 with the last news of Greenland: the burning at the stake of a condemned witch, the insanity and death of the woman this witch was accused of attempting to seduce through witchcraft, and the marriage of the ship's captain, Thorsteinn Ólafsson, to another Icelander, Sigridur Björnsdóttir.[28] However, there are some suggestions of much later unreported voyages from Europe to Greenland, possibly as late as the 1480s.[29] In the mid-1500s, a German ship drifted off-course to Greenland and, coming ashore a small island, discovered the body of a dead man lying face down who demonstrated cultural traits of both Norse and Inuit. An Icelandic crew member of the ship wrote: He had a hood on his head, well sewn, and clothes from both homespun and sealskin. At his side lay a carving knife bent and worn down by whetting. This knife they took with them for display.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to a 2009 study, there is no evidence for perceptible contact between Iceland and Greenland after the mid fifteenth century... It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years. Presumably, the archbishop had better archives at his disposal than most people, and yet he had not heard that the Greenlanders were gone.[18]</p><p>One intriguing fact is that very few fish remains are found among their middens. This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, and may have been disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied more and more of the diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.[31]</p><p>One Inuit story recorded in the 18th century tells that raiding expeditions by European ships over the course of three years destroyed the settlement, after which many of the Norse sailed away south and the Inuit took in some of the remaining women and children before the final attack.[11]</p><h2>Late Dorset and Thule cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png/220px-ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png" width="220" height="286"><br><p>The Thule were skilled whalers, as depicted here by Norwegian missionary Hans Egede in the 18th century.</p><p>The Norse may not have been alone on the island when they arrived; a new influx of Arctic people from the west, the Late Dorset culture, may predate them.[6] However, this culture was limited to the extreme northwest of Greenland, far from the Norse who lived around the southern coasts. Some archaeological evidence may point to this culture slightly predating the Norse settlement. It disappeared around 1300, around the same time as the westernmost of the Norse settlements disappeared. In the region of this culture, there is archaeological evidence of gathering sites for around four to thirty families, living together for a short time during their movement cycle.</p><p>Around 1200, another Arctic culture, the Thule, arrived from the west, having emerged 200 years earlier in Alaska. They settled south of the Late Dorset culture and ranged over vast areas of Greenland's west and east coasts. These people, the ancestors of the modern Inuit, were flexible and engaged in the hunting of almost all animals on land and in the ocean, including big whales. They had dogs, which the Dorset did not, and used them to pull the dog sledges; they also used bows and arrows, contrary to the Dorset. Increasingly settled, they had large food storages to avoid winter famine. The early Thule avoided the highest latitudes, which only became populated again after renewed immigration from Canada in the 19th century.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The nature of the contacts between the Thule, Dorset and Norse cultures is not clear, but may have included trade elements. The level of contact is currently the subject of widespread debate, possibly including Norse trade with Thule or Dorsets in Canada or possible scavenging of abandoned Norse sites (see also Maine penny). No Norse trade goods are known in Dorset archaeological sites in Greenland; the only Norse items found have been characterized as exotic items. Carved screw threads on tools and carvings with beards found in settlements on the Canadian Arctic islands show contact with the Norse. Some stories tell of armed conflicts between, and kidnappings by, both Inuit and Norse groups. The Inuit may have reduced Norse food sources by displacing them on hunting grounds along the central west coast. These conflicts can be one contributing factor to the disappearance of the Norse culture as well as for the Late Dorset, but few see it as the main reason.</p><h2>Danish recolonization[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish colonization of Greenland</p><p>Most of the old Norse records concerning Greenland were removed from Trondheim to Copenhagen in 1664 and subsequently lost, probably in the 1728 fire there.[32] The precise rediscovery is uncertain because south-drifting icebergs during the Little Ice Age long made the eastern coast unreachable, leading to general confusion between Baffin Island, Greenland, and Spitsbergen as seen, for example, in the difficulty locating the Frobisher Strait, which was not confirmed to be a bay until 1861. Nonetheless, interest in discovering a Northwest Passage to Asia led to repeated expeditions in the area, though none were successful until Roald Amundsen in 1906 and even that success involved his being iced in for two years. Christian I of Denmark purportedly sent an expedition to the region under Pothorst and Pining to Greenland in 1472 or 1473; Henry VII of England sent another under Cabot in 1497 and 1498; Manuel I of Portugal sent a third under Corte-Real in 1500 and 1501. It had certainly been generally charted by the 1502 Cantino map, which includes the southern coastline.[32] The island was rediscovered yet again by Martin Frobisher in 1578, prompting the Danish king Frederick II to outfit a new expedition of his own the next year under the Englishman James Alday; this proved a costly failure.[32] The influence of English and Dutch whalers became so pronounced that for a time the western shore of the island itself became known as Davis Strait (Dutch: Straat Davis) after John Davis's 1585 and 1586 expeditions, which charted the western coast as far north as Disko Bay.[33]</p><p>Meanwhile, following Sweden's exit from the Kalmar Union, the remaining states in the personal union were reorganized into Denmark-Norway in 1536. In protest against foreign involvement in the region, the Greenlandic polar bear was included in the state's coat of arms in the 1660s (It was removed in 1958). In the second half of the 17th century Dutch, German, French, Basque, and Dano-Norwegian ships hunted bowhead whales in the pack ice off the east coast of Greenland, regularly coming to shore to trade and replenish drinking water. Foreign trade was later forbidden by Danish monopoly merchants.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Old_Greenland_1747.jpg/220px-Old_Greenland_1747.jpg" width="220" height="140"><br><p>A 1747 map based on Egede's descriptions, including many geographical errors common to the time.</p><p>From 1711 to 1721,[34] the Norwegian cleric Hans Egede petitioned King Frederick IV for funding to travel to Greenland and re-establish contact with the Norse settlers there. Presumably, such settlers would still be Catholic or even pagan and he desired to establish a mission among them to spread the Reformation.[35] Frederick permitted Egede and some Norwegian merchants to establish the Bergen Greenland Company to revive trade with the island but refused to grant them a monopoly over it for fear of antagonizing Dutch whalers in the area.[36] The Royal Mission College assumed superintendency over the mission and provided the company with a small stipend. Egede found but misidentified the ruins of the Norse colony, went bankrupt amid repeated attacks by the Dutch, and found lasting conversion of the migrant Inuit exceedingly difficult. An attempt to found a royal colony under Major Claus Paarss established the settlement of Godthåb (Good Hope) in 1728 but was a costly debacle which saw most of his soldiers mutiny[35] and his settlers killed by scurvy.[37] Two child converts sent to Copenhagen for the coronation of Christian VI returned in 1733 with smallpox, devastating the island. The same ship that returned them, however, also brought the first Moravian missionaries, who in time would convert a former angekok (Inuit shaman), experience a revival at their mission of New Herrnhut, and establish a string of mission houses along the southwest coast. Around the same time, the merchant Jacob Severin took over administration of the colony and its trade and, having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son Poul. Both of them had studied the Kalaallisut language extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College such as Otto Fabricius began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.[34]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden at the 1814 Treaty of Kiel. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like William Scoresby and Greenland-born Knud Rasmussen. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first Greenlandic-language journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.[38] During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from British North America to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the Northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 Lakagígar eruption in Iceland.</p><p>Democratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862–1863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by Fridtjof Nansen accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64°N latitude.[39] In 1911, two Landstings were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in Copenhagen, where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the status quo, as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.</p><p>By 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially Hans Egede (1686 – 1758), a Lutheran missionary called the Apostle of Greenland. He founded Greenland's capital Godthåb, now known as Nuuk. His grandson Hans Egede Saabye (1746 – 1817) continued the missionary activities.[40]</p><h2>Polar exploration[edit]</h2><p>At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including Robert Peary, explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.</p><h2>Strategic importance[edit]</h2><p>See also: History of Greenland during World War II</p><p>After Norway regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian whaler Hallvard Devold occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as Erik the Red's Land. Two years later, the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled in favor of Denmark.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/ThuleAirBase.jpg/220px-ThuleAirBase.jpg" width="220" height="70"><br><p>The Thule Air Base, established after World War II, is the northernmost base of the US Air Force</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>World War II[edit]</h3><p>During World War II, when Nazi Germany extended its war operations to Greenland, Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish Minister to the United States&nbsp;— who had already refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark&nbsp;— signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting the US Armed Forces permission to establish stations in Greenland.[41] Kauffmann did this without the knowledge of the Danish government, and consequently, the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately – none of which had any result.[41] Because of the difficulties for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful export, especially of cryolite, Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status. Its supplies were guaranteed by the United States and Canada.</p><p>One Dane was killed in combat with Germans in Greenland.[41]</p><h3>Cold War[edit]</h3><p>During the Cold War, Greenland had a strategic importance, controlling parts of the passage between the Soviet Arctic harbours and the Atlantic, as well as being a good base for observing any use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, typically planned to pass over the Arctic. The United States therefore had a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100,000,000 but Denmark did not agree to sell.[42][43] In 1951, the Kauffman treaty was replaced by another one. The Thule Air Base at Thule (now Qaanaaq) in the northwest was made a permanent air force base. In 1953, some Inuit families were forced by Denmark to move from their homes to provide space for extension of the base. For this reason, the base has been a source of friction between the Danish government and the Greenlandic people. Tensions mounted when, on January 21, 1968, there was a nuclear accident&nbsp;— a B-52 Stratofortress carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed near the base, contaminating the area with radioactive debris. Although most of the contaminated ice was cleaned up, controversy currently surrounds recently declassified information indicating that one of the bombs was not accounted for. A 1995 Danish parliamentary scandal, dubbed Thulegate, highlighted that nuclear weapons were routinely present in Greenland's airspace in the years leading up to the accident, and that Denmark had tacitly given the go-ahead for this activity despite its official nuclear free policy.</p><p>Another recent controversy surrounds the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), which the United States Air Force upgraded in recent years to a phased array radar.[44] Opponents argue that the system presents a threat to the local population, as it would be targeted in the event of nuclear war.</p><h2>Home rule[edit]</h2><p>See also: Greenlandic independence</p><p>From 1948 to 1950, the Greenland Commission studied the conditions on the island, seeking to address its isolation, unequal laws, and economic stagnation. In the end, the Royal Greenland Trading Department's monopolies were finally removed. In 1953, Greenland was raised from the status of colony to that of an autonomous province or constituent country of the Danish Realm. Greenland was also assigned its own Danish county. Despite its small population, it was provided nominal representation in the Danish Folketing.</p><p>A plantation of exotic arctic trees was created in 1954 near Narsarsuaq.[45]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg/222px-Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg" width="222" height="148"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Blok P, the largest building in Greenland and formerly home to about 1% of its population, was demolished on October 19, 2012.</p><p>Denmark also began a number of reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their dependence on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.[46] Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.</p><p>Greenland's minimal representation in the Folketing meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The Folketing approved devolution in 1978 and the next year enacted home rule under a local Landsting. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985.</p><p>Greenland Home Rule has become increasingly Greenlandized, rejecting Danish and avoiding regional dialects to standardize the country under the language and culture of the Kalaallit (West Greenland Inuit). The capital Godthåb was renamed Nuuk in 1979; a local flag was adopted in 1985; the Danish KGH became the locally administered Kalaallit Niuerfiat (now KNI A/S) in 1986. Following a successful referendum on self-government in 2008, the local parliament's powers were expanded and Danish was removed as an official language in 2009.</p><p>International relations are now largely, but not entirely, also left to the discretion of the home rule government. After leaving the EEC, Greenland signed a special treaty with it,[when?] granting it special access to the market as a constituent country of Denmark, which remains a member. Greenland is also a member of several small organizations[which?] along with Iceland, the Faroes, and the Inuit populations of Canada and Russia.[citation needed] It was one of the founders of the environmental Arctic Council in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 US–Denmark treaty by the Home Rule government. The 1999–2003 Commission on Self-Governance even proposed that Greenland should aim at Thule Air Base's removal from American authority and operation under the aegis of the United Nations.[47]</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

								&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Amt (administrative division))
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Amt is a type of administrative division governing a group of municipalities, today only in Germany, but formerly also common in other countries of Northern Europe.[1] Its size and functions differ by country and the term is roughly equivalent to a US township or county or English shire district.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Current usage[edit]</h2><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>Prevalence[edit]</p><p>The Amt (plural: Ämter) is unique to the German Bundesländer (federal states) of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.</p><p>Other German states had this subdivision in the past. Some states have similar administrative units called Samtgemeinde (Lower Saxony), Verbandsgemeinde (Rhineland-Palatinate) or Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia).</p><p>Definition[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An Amt, as well as the other above-mentioned units, is subordinate to a Kreis (district) and is a collection of municipalities. The amt is lower than district-level government but higher than municipal government, and may be described as a supra-municipality or municipal confederation. Normally, it consists of very small municipalities (Gemeinden, plural of Gemeinde).</p><p>Larger municipalities do not belong to an Amt and are called amtsfreie Gemeinden (independent municipalities); some of these municipalities may also not depend from a Kreis (district) and are called kreisfreie Gemeinden, and when they do also not belong to any other Land they are also called Stadtstaaten (plural of Stadtstaat), i.e. city-states (Berlin and Hamburg).</p><p>These large municipalities (cities, in German Städte, plural of Stadt) may be further subdivided into local offices named Ortsämter (plural of Ortsamt), each of them possibly grouping several suburbs (or small townships in rural areas) of the municipality named Ortsteile (plural of Ortsteil), named from small villages or hamlets or localities. The Ortsteil (suburb or township) may have been a former parish, but today it is meant only for civil purpose and essentially used for planning within the municipality; the Ortsamt (sometimes just named informally but confusingly as an Amt, or informally translated as an urban district) is used to offer decentralized services of the municipality within local administrative offices for the residents in neighbouring suburbs. The Ortsteil itself may also be confusingly translated as a municipality, but it is incorrect because it belongs to a city which is the only effective municipality (Gemeinde).</p><h2>Former usage[edit]</h2><h3>Denmark[edit]</h3><p>The amt (plural, amter; commonly translated as county) was an administrative unit of Denmark (and, historically, of Denmark-Norway). The counties were established by royal decree in 1662 as replacements for the former Len (fiefs). The amter were originally composed of independent towns (købstæder) and parishes, and held only small areas of responsibility. During the 20th century, they were granted responsibility for the hospital service for the non-urban population. A 1970 administrative reform reduced the number of counties to fourteen and eliminated the administrative distinction between (rural) parish and town. From then on, the amter were composed of a number of municipalities (kommuner). The reform granted the counties wider areas of responsibility, most notably running the national health service and the gymnasium secondary schools.</p><p>The Danish Municipal Reform of January 1, 2007 abolished the amter and replaced them with five administrative regions, now solely charged with running the national health service. In contrast to the amter the regions hold no authority to levy taxes. The reform re-delegated all other areas of responsibility to either the municipalities or the state. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98. See Counties of Denmark for more information about the Danish usage of the term.</p><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>In Germany an Amt was a medieval administrative district covering a manorial estate or the land owned by a castle or village. It was headed by an Amtmann, usually a lesser nobleman or cleric, appointed by a territorial lord to administer and dispense justice within the Amt.</p><h3>Netherlands and Flanders[edit]</h3><p>Ambacht can be seen as the Dutch equivalent to amt. Ambachten existed in Holland, Zeeland and Flanders up to about 1800.</p><h3>Iceland[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While Iceland was a territory of the Danish realm, amts (singular: amt; plural: ömt) were established in the country on top of the existing counties. From 1684 to 1770, Iceland as whole was a single amt in the Kingdom of Denmark but was then split into two amts: North and East Amt (Norður- og Austuramt) and South and West Amt (Suður- og Vesturamt). The latter was in 1787 split into a West Amt (Vesturamt) and South Amt (Suðuramt). Iceland was thus divided into three amts until 1872, when the South and West amts were again merged. Amts were abolished in 1904, when Iceland gained home rule from Denmark.</p><p>Amts are not used to denote a geographical region in Iceland but the name lives on in the names of two public libraries in Iceland that were established during the amt era. The Amts libraries in Akureyri and Stykkishólmur which were established as the designated archives for the North and East Amt and the West Amt respectively.</p><h3>Norway[edit]</h3><p>From 1662 to 1919, the counties of Norway were called amter. They are now referred to as fylker, a term revived from the Middle Ages.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

In the 10th century, King Harald Bluetooth became a Christian and began organizing the church, and by the 11th century, Christianity was largely accepted throughout the country. Since the Reformation in Denmark, the Church has been Evangelical Lutheran, while retaining much of its pre-Reformation liturgical traditions. The 1849 Constitution of Denmark designated the church the Danish people's church and mandates that the state support it as such.[7]</p><p>The Church of Denmark continues to maintain the historical episcopate. Theological authority is vested in bishops: ten bishops in mainland Denmark and one in Greenland, each overseeing a diocese. There is no archbishop; the Bishop of Copenhagen acts as a primus inter pares.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Organization[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Peter_Skov-Jakobsen.jpg/170px-Peter_Skov-Jakobsen.jpg" width="170" height="220"><br><p>Peter Skov-Jakobsen, current Bishop of Copenhagen since 2009</p><h3>Dioceses[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark is organized in eleven dioceses, each led by a bishop, including one for Greenland (the Faroe Islands was a twelfth diocese until 29 July 2007). There are no archbishops; the most senior bishop (primus inter pares) is the Bishop of Copenhagen, currently Peter Skov-Jakobsen. The further subdivision includes 111 deaneries and 2,200 parishes. There are about 2,400 vicars.[citation needed]</p><h3>Parishes[edit]</h3><p>Each parish has a parochial council, elected by church members in four-year terms. The parochial council leads the practical business of the local church and decides employment of personnel, including the vicar(s). The vicar is subordinate to the council, except in spiritual matters such as conducting church services and pastoral care. Both parochial councils and vicars are, however, subordinate to bishops.</p><p>Voluntary congregations[edit]</p><p>A special feature is the possibility of creating voluntary congregations (valgmenighed) within the Church. These account for a few percent of church members. They are voluntary associations, electing their own parochial council and vicar, whom they agree to pay from their own pockets. In return, they are exempt from church tax. The voluntary congregation and its vicar are subordinate to bishops, and members remain full members of the Church. Historically, when a parish was dominated by a conservative majority and rector, the liberal minority would often set up a voluntary congregation with their own rector - and vice versa. Today the voluntary congregations are often a solution for people who find the idea of a free church appealing, but wish to keep some bonds to the church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Parish optionality[edit]</p><p>Another, less commonly used feature is parish optionality (sognebåndsløsning, literally parish bond release). If a Church member is dissatisfied with the particular vicar of his residence parish, he may choose to be served by another vicar who matches better with his Christian views, for example in a neighbouring parish.</p><h3>Membership[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Religion in Denmark</p><p>According to official statistics from January 2017, 75.9% of Danes are members of the Church of Denmark.[5] Membership rates vary from 58.1% in the Diocese of Copenhagen to 85.2% in the Diocese of Viborg. In recent years, the percentage of Danes that are members of the church has been slowly declining, the most important reasons being immigration from non-Lutheran countries, withdrawal of some members, and a somewhat lower rate (61.5%) of Danish infants being christened.[9]</p><p>Any person who is baptised (usually infant baptism) into the Church of Denmark automatically becomes a member. Members may renounce their membership and later return if they wish. Excommunication is legally possible but an extraordinarily rare occurrence. Examples include declared Satanists. A church member supporting reincarnation was excommunicated, but the Supreme Court overturned the excommunication in 2005.</p><h3>Faith and church attendance[edit]</h3><p>According to the latest inquiry about 2.4% [10] of church members attend services every week, although on Christmas Eve more than a third of the population attend. However, the church is still widely used for traditional family ceremonies including christenings and confirmations. In the year 2015, 33.8% of weddings[11][2] and 83.7% funerals were performed in the Church of Denmark,[12] and 71% of adolescents in grade 7–8 were confirmed.[13] The level of weekly church attendance is similar to that in Norway and Sweden.</p><p>According to a 2009 poll, 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the Son of God, and 18% believe he is the saviour of the world.[14]</p><h2>Doctrine[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG/220px-Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG" width="220" height="331"><br><p>Communion table and baptismal font in Besser Church, Samsø</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The church is aimed at having a wide acceptance of theological views, as long as they agree with the official symbolic books as stipulated in the Danish Code of 1683.

Both the Bible translations and the Hymn Book implied widespread public and theological debate.</p><p>Historically, there is a contrast between a liberal current inspired by N. F. S. Grundtvig and more strict, pietist or Bible fundamentalist movements (such as Indre Mission). These tensions have sometimes threatened to divide the Church. Tidehverv is a minor fraction based on a strict Lutheranism and anti-modern, national-conservative views.[15][16]</p><p>The Church of Denmark is member of the Porvoo Communion between Lutheran and Anglican Churches.</p><h3>Liturgy[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Konfirmander.jpg/220px-Konfirmander.jpg" width="220" height="308"><br><p>Children preparing to be confirmed and become members of the church</p><p>The Communion Service includes three readings from the Bible: a chapter from one of the Gospels, from one of the Epistles or another part of the New Testament and, since 1992, from the Old Testament. Texts are picked from an official list following the church year. Some liturgical features have a fixed content but are free to the form. This accounts for the Common Prayer following the sermon, where the priest is obliged to mention the royal house. Some will simply mention the Queen and all her House whereas others will list all members of the royal house by name and title.</p><p>The sermon, as in other Protestant churches, is a central part of the service. The priest takes a starting point in the text of that Sunday, but is free to form a personal message of it. At special occasions, even non-priests may be allowed to preach. Hymns are also very central. In contrast to Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, Danish congregations sit while singing and stand while listening to Bible readings.</p><p>As in other Lutheran churches, the Church of Denmark recognizes only two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. These are usually included in the Communion Service. Formerly, individual or shared confession was a condition to receive the Lord's Supper. An official confession ritual still exists, but is now used very rarely. There are also official rituals for confirmation, wedding, blessing of a civil wedding and funerals. Emergency baptism may be performed by any Christian if necessary, and later the child will then be produced in Church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Church and state[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg/220px-Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>The Church of Our Lady, the cathedral of Copenhagen and the National Cathedral of Denmark</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg/220px-RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg" width="220" height="305"><br><p>Roskilde Cathedral has been the burial place of Danish royalty since the 15th century.

This applies to the royal princes and princesses as well, but does not apply to their spouses. Traditionally, though, every foreigner who has become a member of the royal family has converted or become a member of the church; as a result, the Prince Consort Henrik converted from Catholicism before marrying the Queen in 1968, and Mary Donaldson also converted from Presbyterianism before marrying Crown Prince Frederik in 2004.</p><h3>Freedom of religion[edit]</h3><p>With the Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Lutheran Christianity was established as the state religion. For the next century, in a time when religious wars swept Europe, harsh persecution of other faiths followed (Lutheran orthodoxy). Exceptions were granted only to foreign diplomats. For at least a period in the 16th century, small circles of clandestine Catholicism prevailed. From 1683, Roman Catholic, Reformed and Jewish congregations were allowed in the new town of Fredericia, the latter two also in Copenhagen. Non-Lutherans were also allowed in Friedrichstadt and on Nordstrand in Slesvig and in Glückstadt in Holstein. With the constitution of 1849, freedom of religion was introduced in Denmark, but Lutheranism remained the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Recognised and approved religions[edit]</p><p>A religious community does not need any state approval in order to enjoy the freedom of religion granted by the constitution. However, state-approved congregations (godkendte trossamfund) enjoy several privileges. They may conduct legal weddings, establish own cemeteries, get residence permits for foreign priests, are exempt from corporate and property tax, may apply for means from the state lottery fund, and members may tax-deduct membership fees and presents to the congregation.</p><p>Additionally, those congregations recognised by royal decree before 1970 (anerkendte trossamfund) may name and baptize children with legal effect, keep their own church registers and transcribe certificates on the basis of such registers.[6]</p><p>This legal distinction between recognised and approved communities remains, but is mainly a historical one. Communities recognised before 1970 includes only eight well-established Christian communities as well as one Jewish community. From 1970 until the 1990s only a few more Christian congregations were approved, but since 1998, a much more liberal practice has ensued. Since then, a board of independent experts decide about approval of new religious communities. The board includes professors of law, religious studies and theology and works under the Ministry of Justice, deliberately separate from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical affairs. It merely investigates whether the organisation fulfills basic definitions, such as having a doctrine, creed and cult, in order to be called a congregation of faith. In 2003, the approval of the Forn Sed religion caused some public debate.</p><h3>Lack of central authority[edit]</h3><p>The Church is in practice barred from having official positions in political or other matters, since it has no central bodies that could define such stances: nor a spiritual leader (such as an archbishop), nor a central assembly or synod. Bishops have the last say on doctrinal questions within their respective dioceses. The Queen (in practice the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Parliament are the central bodies, but they usually keep to administrative matters and abstain from interfering with spiritual questions. Church laws are rarely changed, and, when it happens, only administrative matters are affected.</p><p>Firstly, these principles are generally believed to ensure a non-sectarian, tolerant church where parishioners and priests enjoy a high degree of freedom to practise their own interpretation of Lutheran Christianity. Secondly, many Danish politicians and theologians claim that only this church-state-model will ensure the division of politics and religion, since the Church cannot interfere with political matters or even claim to speak with one voice on behalf of its members. They frequently discourage the term state church and argue it is, as its name states, the people's church.</p><p>Article 66 of the Danish Constitution stipulates a church ordinance shall be laid down by law. This promissory clause dates back from the first Constitution of 1849 but was never put into practice. It was feared that splits could occur if a central authority were created.</p><p>In very few cases have politicians deviated from their traditional hands-off course in church doctrinal matters. Where they have done so, it has been with the declared aim of preventing a possible split in the church. See the issues of Female clergy and Same-sex marriage above.</p><h3>Civil registration[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark conducts civil registration of births, deaths, change of name etc. (vital records). The keeping of such kirkebøger (church books) is a centuries-long tradition, dating from when the parish rectors were the only government representatives in rural areas. In 2002-03 the traditional church records were replaced by a new national electronic registration system called Personregistrering. After protests in 2005, the Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder announced that people who for various reasons did not want to send their registration forms (e.g. births and namings) to the local church office could now send their forms to a central office located in Nykøbing Falster.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 2010 parents' duty to report the birth of their child was abolished. Instead, it was decided that in the future it was the task of the midwives to report all births in Denmark (only when a midwife isn't present at the birth of a child are the parents still obliged to report the birth of the child).</p><p>From 1 December 2014 all applications should be submitted in digital form whenever possible.</p><h3>Economic support[edit]</h3><p>§4 in the Constitution of Denmark stipulates that The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17] On the other hand, §68 ensures that citizens are not obliged to pay personal contributions to any religion other than their own.[17] It has been questioned how these two principles can co-exist. Non-members do not pay church tax, but an additional state subsidiary accounts for 12% of the Church's income. This means every citizen, even a non-member, contributes with an average of 130 kroner annually (US$23). In addition, the bishops are high-ranking officials whose salary is fully paid by the state. In return, certain public tasks are carried out by the Church, such as conducting vital records registries and managing graveyards which are open to all denominations.</p><h3>Separation of church and state[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Kierkegaard.jpg/170px-Kierkegaard.jpg" width="170" height="252"><br><p>The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard was an outspoken advocate of separation of church and state[18]</p><p>The debate about separation of church and state emerges occasionally in Denmark. The current arrangement is supported by most political parties. It has been challenged for decades by the left wing and by atheists; more recently also by some ideological liberals and some members of free churches.</p><p>Proponents for a separation (disestablishment) argue the state church violates equality of religions and the principle of the secular state. Proponents for the current system argue that membership is voluntary, that the existence of a state church has ancient historical roots, and that the church fulfils certain administrative tasks for the state. They also argue it would be difficult to decide whether church-owned real estate should be handed over to the state or not. The former possessions of the Catholic Church were ceded to the Crown at the reformation in 1536.</p><p>According to a poll conducted by the free daily MetroXpress in April 2007, 52% wished to split church and state, 30% were against, and 18% undecided. Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, spoke out against a split: Church and state will be separated when more than half of the population are no longer members. N. F. S. Grundtvig said so, and I support that. The opposition Social Democrats also argued against a split, but said there should be more equality between denominations, possibly by a state subsidiary paid to other approved religious communities as well.[19] Immigrant groups and the Muslim society are divided on the issue, as some think official Christianity is preferable to a purely secular state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Pure equality of religions exists only in a minority of Western European countries. Besides Denmark, only the Faroe Islands, Iceland, England and Greece have official state churches, while Scotland has an officially recognised national church that is not connected to the state. Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria have official ties to Catholicism (concordat), but these ties do not extend to Catholicism being recognised as the state religion in these countries. Further there are varying degrees of public funding of the church in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Sweden in most cantons of Switzerland, and in the Alsace-Moselle region of France.</p><h3>Similar Nordic Evangelical-Lutheran churches[edit]</h3><h2>Controversial issues[edit]</h2><p>See also: Homosexuality and Lutheranism</p><h3>Female clergy[edit]</h3><p>The ordination of women, having been discussed within the church since the 1920s, has been allowed since 1948, despite some rather strong early resistance from the clergy. The then Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs was contacted by a parochial council who wished to employ a female priest. He decided there was no legal obstacle to that.[20] The first woman to become a bishop was instituted in 1995. Today two thirds of theology students are women, and the clergy is expected to have a female majority in the near future.</p><p>Among a small conservative minority, resistance to women ordained as clergy remains. In 2007 the Bishop of Viborg, known as a moderate conservative, revealed that he had given special consideration to priests who were known to be against ordained women. He had organised ordination ceremonies in such a way that new priests who so wished could avoid shaking hands with, or receiving the laying on of hands from, women ordained as priests. According to the bishop, this had happened twice in the 100 ordinations he had performed. The matter became headline news amidst a debate about Muslim fundamentalists who refuse to shake hands with members of the opposite sex. The Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Bertel Haarder, said he would discuss the matter with the bishops, but also stated that tolerance for various views should be respected. In contrast, the Minister for Employment, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, thought that the priests in question should be dismissed, as public employees are obliged to shake hands with anyone.[21]</p><h3>Same-sex marriage[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Same-sex marriage in Denmark</p><p>A 2011 poll of the Danish public found that 75.8% of Danes approve of same-sex marriages being performed in the church.[22]</p><p>According to a 2011 survey of 1137 priests, 62% of them supported same-sex marriage in the Church on the same basis as for heterosexuals, while 28% were against. A map of the results hints at the traditional west-east division, with a conservative wing being dominant in central West Jutland (the former Ringkjøbing Amt) and on Bornholm, but liberal priests dominating in most other areas.[23]</p><p>In 2004, a poll among pastors said 60% were against church marriage of same-sex couples.[24]</p><p>Early position of the church[edit]</p><p>Since Denmark approved same-sex civil unions (registered partnership) in 1989, the question of church blessing ceremonies for such unions emerged. After an enquiry from the Danish National Association of Gays and Lesbians in 1993, bishops set up a commission to reach a stance on the matter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An early stance on registered partnerships was reached in 1997. Bishops maintained that the ceremony of marriage was God's framework for the relation between a man and a woman, but this view of marriage was not affected by the fact that some people chose to live in a responsible community with a person of the same sex, approved by society, i.e. a registered partnership. The bishops disapproved of institutionalising new rituals, but couples who wished a non-ritualised marking in church of their registered partnership should be obliged. In such cases, it would be up to the rector to decide, and he should seek advice from his bishop.[25]</p><p>At this time, many churches chose to bless registered partnerships, however this blessing was distinguished from a legal ceremony, which was performed by a mayor or another municipal official.[26]</p><p>Same-sex marriages accepted[edit]</p><p>However, on 15 June 2012 the Church of Denmark made the decision to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and not merely bless them; therefore Denmark now recognises same-sex marriages. In early 2012 Minister for Equality, Ecclesiastical Affairs and Nordic Cooperation Manu Sareen introduced a bill approving same-sex marriage, which was passed in parliament in June 2012.[27] A wedding ritual with liturgy has been developed and presented to parliament by the eleven bishops who are in favor of same-sex marriages being performed in church.[28] Manu Sareen and a majority of bishops initially proposed the ritual would not declare the same-sex couple 'spouses', but 'life partners' (livsfæller, a Danish neologism), but the minister later changed his mind on this detail. Two conservative organisations within the church, Inner Mission and Lutheran Mission, as well as one of the twelve bishops, maintain their protests against same-sex marriage.[29] It will be up to each individual priest to decide whether he or she will conduct marriages of same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple was married on Friday 15 June.[30]</p><p>The process towards the official recognition of same sex marriage in the Church of Denmark began on 8 February 1973, when 'Provo Priest' Harald Søbye performed a wedding of a male couple, although not legally recognised, on a suggestion from a journalist at the newspaper Ekstra Bladet, which announced it as 'The World's First Gay Wedding'. On 25 February 1973 Harald Søbye performed another wedding, of a female couple, in a television programme. The state prosecutor investigated the cases, but concluded that the priest's use of his vestment was not illegal. Søbye had been retired in 1964 for political activism, but remained an ordained priest within the church. During the next 15 years, Søbye performed around 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples.[31]</p><p>When Denmark introduced registered partnerships in 1989, the issue of same-sex marriage for some years received little attention. Church blessings of these partnerships slowly gained ground (see above). Later, the possibility of registered partnership, or same-sex marriage, performed by the church came under discussion. The issue was brought up in an unusual way by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2004, who said he would approve of such a change, although he claimed to speak as a private person on this issue, not as prime minister.</p><p>Views among proponents vary whether such a ceremony should be called 'marriage' or merely 'registered partnership' (registreret partnerskab), as the present same-sex civil union is called. Most likely, clergy would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages or not, similar to the right to deny remarriage of divorced persons (a policy employed by a conservative minority of priests).</p><p>Constitutionality[edit]</p><p>A further controversy is that this new practice may be against the Danish constitution; §4 of the Danish constitution states: The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17]</p><p>§4 not only establish Folkekirken as the state church, but also gives certain boundaries as to what the state church is. It is forced to follow the Lutheran doctrines and if, as some critics claim [1], the Lutheran doctrines explicitly state that homosexuality is a sin then it is a violation of the constitution to allow gay marriages in the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Gay clergy[edit]</h3><p>Gay and lesbian clergy exist, and this is generally considered a strictly personal issue. Parish councils are central in selecting and employing new priests, including interviews with candidates. Once employed, parish priests are public servants and cannot be discharged except for neglect of duties, which will finally be the bishop's decision.</p><p>In 2011 a female priest serving two small island parishes was fired after controversies with the parish council of Agersø, while the neighbouring Omø supported her. She claimed to have been ousted because of her sexuality, but the parish council rejected this accusation and mentioned 'cooperation problems' as the cause. Twenty years ago she had come out as lesbian and a practitioner of sadomasochism in a Swedish TV programme.[32][33]</p><p>In 2009 a parish priest in Tingbjerg, a Copenhagen suburb, moved away from the parish to a secret address after assaults against his vicarage, his car and the parish church. The vicarage was put up for sale. According to Avisen.dk, local youths claimed they harassed him because he was openly homosexual, among other reasons.[34] The priest himself denied this was the issue, but rather claimed the assaults were part of a general tendency in the 'crumbling district', and intensified after he spoke out in public about the local youth crime.[35] A Sunday service held a few weeks later was attended by several prominent guests supporting the priest, including Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, and photographer Jacob Holdt.[36] Tingbjerg is a single-plan public housing area, marked by gang violence and youth crime, and the most criminal district of Copenhagen.[37]</p><h3>Declaration Dominus Iesus[edit]</h3><p>In 2000, the Church of Denmark's ecumenical department publicly criticized the Roman Catholic declaration Dominus Iesus, which controversially used the term ecclesial community to refer to Protestant denominations, including Lutheran churches. The Church of Denmark argued that there is a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another of the right to be called a Church and that it is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian.[38]</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas, around 15–20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their home language.</p><p>Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples that lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic. A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as Mainland Scandinavian while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as Insular Scandinavian.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Until the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions. With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing, a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared, though there are regional variants of the standard language. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.</p><p>Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 phonemically distinctive vowels,[4] and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon stød, a kind of laryngeal phonation type. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and weakly pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand,[5] and there is some evidence that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish.[6] The grammar is moderately inflective with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. As in English, Danish only has remnants of a former case system, particularly in the pronouns, and it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is V2, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/North_Germanic_languages.svg/300px-North_Germanic_languages.svg.png" width="300" height="200"><br><p>Danish and its relation to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European</p><p>Danish is a Germanic language of the North Germanic branch. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the Old Norse language; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.[7][8]</p><p>Scandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where there are no sharp dividing lines between the different vernacular languages.[7]</p><p>Like Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.[7]</p><p>Danish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), Insular Danish (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including Bornholmian and Scanian). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.[7]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Mutual intelligibility[edit]</h3><p>Danish is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Swedish. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.[9] The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.[10] Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.[9]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Danish</p><h3>Donsk tunga[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Old Norse</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG/250px-Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG" width="250" height="184"><br><p>The approximate extent of Old Norse and related languages in the early 10th century:

Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson[11]</p><p>By the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language was generally called the Danish tongue (Donsk tunga), or Norse language (Norrœnt mál). Norse was written in the runic alphabet, first with the elder futhark and from the 9th century with the younger futhark.</p><p>From the 7th century the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Denmark and Sweden). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.[12] A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong æi (Old West Norse ei) to the monophthong e, as in stæin to sten. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin. There was also a change of au as in dauðr into ø as in døðr. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tauþr into tuþr. Moreover, the øy (Old West Norse ey) diphthong changed into ø as well, as in the Old Norse word for island. This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.[13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Through Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England. Many words derived from Norse, such as gate (gade) for street, still survive in Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia, parts of eastern England colonized by Danish Vikings. The city of York was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example are (er), knife (kniv), husband (husbond), and egg (æg).[14] The suffix -by for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby and Grimsby. The word dale meaning valley is common in Yorkshire and Derbyshire placenames.</p><h3>Old Danish[edit]</h3><p>Fangær man saar i hor seng mæth annæns mansz kunæ. oc kumær han burt liuænd....

Jutlandic Law, 1241 [15]</p><p>In the medieval period Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The Jutlandic Law and Scanian Law were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350 Danish began to be used as a language of administration and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.[16]</p><p>Throughout this period Danish was in contact with Low German, and many Low German loans were introduced in this period.[17] With the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. It is also in this period that Danish begins to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the stød the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.[18]</p><p>The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the Rimkrøniken (Rhyming Chronicle), a history book told in rhymed verses.[19] The first complete translation of the Bible in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by Christiern Pedersen was published in 1550. Pedersen's orthographic choices set the de facto standard for subsequent writing in Danish.[20]</p><h3>Early Modern Danish[edit]</h3><p>Herrer og Narre have frit Sprog.

Peder Syv, proverbs</p><p>Following the first Bible translation the development of Danish as a written language, and as a language of religion, administration and public discourse sped up. In the second half of the 17th century a number of grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them Rasmus Bartholin's 1657 Latin grammar De studio lingvæ danicæ; then Laurids Olufsen Kock's 1660 grammar of the Zealand dialect Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, Den Danske Sprog-Kunst (The Art of the Danish Language) by Peder Syv. Significant authors from this period are Thomas Kingo, poet and psalmist, and Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, whose novel Jammersminde (Remembered Woes) is considered a literary masterpiece. Orthography was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of Jens Pedersen Høysgaard was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the stød. In this period scholars were also discussing whether it was best to write as one speaks or to speak as one writes, including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. han er he is vs. de ere they are).</p><p>The East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the Treaty of Brömsebro after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, begininnig also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the de facto official standard language, especially in writing - this was the original so-called rigsdansk (Danish of the Realm). Also beginning in the mid 18th century, the skarre-R, the uvular R sound ([?]), began spreading through Denmark, probably through influence from Parisian French and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden and coastal southern Norway.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 18th century Danish philology was advanced by Rasmus Rask, who pioneered the disciplines of comparative and historical linguistics and wrote the first English language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish flourished with the works of Ludvig Holberg, whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by Hans Egede, Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language up until the mid 20th century.</p><h3>Standardized national language[edit]</h3><p>Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,

N.F.S. Grundtvig, "Modersmaalet"</p><p>Following the loss of Schleswig to Germany, a sharp influx of German speakers moved into the area, eventually outnumbering the Danish speakers. The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called Golden Age of Danish culture. Authors such as N.F.S. Grundtvig emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish language authors of this period are existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and prolific fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen.[22] The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the Schleswig referendum in 1920 a number of Danes remained as a minority within German territories.[23] Throughout the 19th Century Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina where memory and some use of Danish remains today.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png/220px-LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png" width="220" height="237"><br><p>Language shift in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig.</p><p>After the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter Å/å. Three 20th century Danish authors have become Nobel Prize laureates in Literature: Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan (joint recipients in 1917) and Johannes V. Jensen (awarded 1944).</p><p>With the exclusive use of rigsdansk, the High Copenhagenian Standard, in national broadcasting, the traditional dialects came under increased pressure. In the 20th century they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country.[24] Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called regionssprog (regional languages) remain, and are in some cases vital. Today the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagenian, associated with elderly, well to-do and well educated people of the capital, and low-Copenhagenian traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations.[25][26] Also in the 21st century the influence of immigration has had linguistic consequences, such as the emergence of a so-called multiethnolect in the urban areas, an immigrant Danish variety (also known as Perkerdansk), combining elements of different immigrant languages such as Arabic, Turkish and Kurdish, as well as English and Danish.[25]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Geographic distribution[edit]</h2><p>Danish is the national language of Denmark and one of two official languages of the Faroe Islands (alongside Faroese). Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside Greenlandic). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as lingua franca, and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speak Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English.[27]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG/220px-Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Learn Danish banner in Flensburg, Germany where it is an officially recognized regional language</p><p>In addition, there is a noticeable community of Danish speakers in Southern Schleswig, the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized regional language, just as German is north of the border. Furthermore, Danish is one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council.[28] Under the Nordic Language Convention, Danish-speaking citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.[28]</p><p>The more widespread of the two varieties of Norwegian, Bokmål, is very close to Danish, because standard Danish was used as the de facto administrative language until 1814. Bokmål is based on Danish unlike the other variety of Norwegian, Nynorsk, which is based on the Norwegian dialects, with Old Norwegian as an important reference point.[7]</p><p>There is no law stipulating an official language for Denmark, making Danish the de facto language only. The Code of Civil Procedure does, however, lay down Danish as the language of the courts.[29] Since 1997 public authorities have been obliged to observe the official spelling by way of the Orthography Law. In the 21st century there have been discussions regarding creating a language law that would make Danish the official language of Denmark.[30]</p><h2>Dialects[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish dialects</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Danishdialectmap.png/250px-Danishdialectmap.png" width="250" height="184"><br><p>Map of Danish dialects</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Denmark-stoed.png/220px-Denmark-stoed.png" width="220" height="258"><br><p>A map showing the distribution of stød in Danish dialects.

In Zealand the transition from three to two genders has happened fairly recently. West of the red line the definite article goes before the word as in English or German; east of the line it takes the form of a suffix.</p><p>Standard Danish (rigsdansk) is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital, Copenhagen. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.[24][7]</p><p>Danish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects. Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.[31][24]</p><p>Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas:</p><p>Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic. Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn and Lolland-Falster dialect areas - each with addition internal variation. The term Eastern Danish[35] is occasionally used for Bornholmian, but including the dialects of Scania (particularly in a historical context). Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish and Bornholmian. Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to Sweden and subsequently swedified.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Traditional dialects differ both in phonology, grammar and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of stød.[36] There are four main regional variants for the realization of stød: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland and Ærø, there is no stød but instead a pitch accent. South of a line (Danish: Stødgrænsen The Stød border) going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, Møn, Southern Zealand and Bornholm there is neither stød nor pitch accent.[37] In most of Jutland and on Zealand there is stød, and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language there are often more stød occurrences than in the standard language. In Zealand the stød line divides Southern Zealand (without stød), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.[38][39]</p><p>Grammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of suffixes, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as West Germanic languages. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three grammatical genders.[34] Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900 Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.[40] Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: Katti, han får unger, literally The cat, he is having kittens, because cat is a male noun, and thus are referred to as han (he), even if it is female cat.[41]</p><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish phonology</p><p>The sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody. In informal or rapid speech the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language's prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to segment the speech flow into its constituent elements.[5][42] These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and there are even indications that Danish children take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.[6]</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><p>Although somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels and two schwa vowels, /?/ and /?/ that only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes - a very large number among the world's languages.[43] At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either [i?], [u?] or [??].[44] The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by Grønnum (1998) in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in IPA for Danish. Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. Basbøll (2005):50 gives 25 full vowels, not counting the two unstressed schwa-vowels.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>The consonant inventory is comparatively simple. Basbøll (2005:73) distinguishes 16 non-syllabic consonant phonemes in Danish.</p><p>Many of these phonemes have quite different allophones in onset and coda. Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration and fortis vs. lenis.[44] /p t k/ are aspirated in onset realized as [b??, d??, g°?], but not in coda. The pronunciation of t, [d??], is in between a simple aspirated [d??] and a fully affricated [d?s] as has happened in German with many words that now contain z. The stops /b d g/ are realized as [b?, d?, g°] in onset and as [b? ð???, j/??] in coda. In syllable onset the phonemes /b d g v j r/ are contoid (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become vocoids, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, løb/ (grave, ran) are pronounced [grau?, løu?].</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>[?, ð] often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as approximants. Danish [ð] differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar approximant which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] (or [?]) by second language learners.[44]</p><p>The sound [?] is found for example in the word /sjov?/ fun pronounced [??u??] and /tjal?/ marijuana pronounced [t?al?]. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after /s/ or /t/ and [j] doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an allophone of /j/, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a /?/-phoneme in Danish.[46]</p><p>In onset /r/ is realized as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant, [?], but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic low central vowel, [??] or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the r in German or in non-rhotic pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of /r/ as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled [r].</p><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Danish is characterized by a prosodic feature called stød (lit. thrust). This is a form of laryngealization or creaky voice. Some sources have described it as a glottal stop, but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.[47] It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in minimal pairs such as bønder (peasants) with stød, versus bønner (beans) without stød. The distribution of stød in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian pitch accents found in most dialects of Norwegian and Swedish.[48]</p><p>Stress is phonemic and distinguishes words such as billigst ['bilist] cheapest and bilist [bi'list] car driver.[49]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish grammar</p><p>Similarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs tager/tog (takes/took) and fod/fødder (foot/feet)) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as elsker/elskede love/loved, bil/biler car/cars). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.[50]</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an enclitic. A distinctive feature of the Scandinavian languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. fod/fødder foot/feet, mand/mænd man/men) or weak stems inflected through affixation (e.g. skib/skibe ship/ships, kvinde/kvinder woman/women).[51]</p><p>Gender[edit]
Main article: Gender in Danish and Swedish</p><p>Standard Danish has two nominal genders: common and neuter; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the common gender, and neuter is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized.The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. [52]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Definiteness[edit]</p><p>Definiteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.[53] Neuter nouns take the clitic -et, and common gender nouns take -en. Indefinite nouns take the articles en (common gender) or et (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun en mand a man (indefinite) has the definite form manden the man, whereas the neuter noun et hus a house (indefinite) has the definite form, the house (definite) huset.[52] [54]</p><p>Indefinite:</p><p>Jeg så et hus
"I saw a house"</p><p>Definite with enclitic article:</p><p>Jeg så huset
"I saw the house"</p><p>Definite with preposed demonstrative article:</p><p>Jeg så det store hus[55]
"I saw the big house"</p><p>The plural definite ending is -(e)ne (e.g. drenge boys &gt; drengene the boys and piger girls &gt; pigerne the girls), and nouns ending in -ere lose the last -e before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. danskere Danes &gt; danskerne the Danes). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article den (common) or det (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: den store mand the big man, det store hus the big house.[56][54]</p><p>Number[edit]</p><p>There are three different types of regular plurals: Class 1 forms the plural with the suffix -er (indefinite) and -erne (definite), Class 2 with the suffix -e (indefinite) and -ene (definite.), and Class 3 takes no suffix for the plural indefinite form and -ene for the plural definite.[57]</p><p>Most irregular nouns take an ablaut plural (with a change in the stem vowel), or combine ablaut stem-change with the suffix, and some have unique plural forms. Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of øje eye, which is the old dual form øjne), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word konto account which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form konti accounts).[58][59]</p><p>Possession[edit]</p><p>Possessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -s, for example min fars hus my father's house where the noun far carries the possessive enclitic.[60] This is however not a case of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik the king of Denmark's candy factory, or det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with, where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.[61][62]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>As does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (han he), animate feminine (hun she) forms, as well as inanimate neuter (det it) and inanimate common gender (den it) [63]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Jeg sover
"I sleep"


Du sover
"you sleep"


Jeg kysser dig
"I kiss you"


du kysser mig
"you kiss me"</p><p>Possessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (det er min hest it is my horse), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (den er min it is mine). In the third person singular sin is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas hans (his), hendes (her) and dens/dets its is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.[64][65]</p><p>Han tog sin hat
He took his (own) hat


Han tog hans hat
He took his hat (someone else's hat)

Nominal compounds[edit]</p><p>Like all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in kvindehåndboldlandsholdet, the female national handball team. In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra s, originally possessive in function, like landsmand (from land, country, and mand, man, meaning compatriot), but landmand (from same roots, meaning farmer). Some words are joined with an extra e, like gæstebog (from gæst and bog, meaning guest book).</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>Danish verbs are morphologically simple, marking very few grammatical categories. They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.[66]</p><p>Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice[edit]</p><p>Verbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.[53] The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -te and those that take the suffix -ede.[67]</p><p>The infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced [?]), infinitive forms are preceded by the article at (pronounced [?]).[67] The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -r, except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.[68]</p><p>The present participle ends in -ende (e.g. løbende running), and the past participle ends in -et (e.g. løbet run), -t (e.g. købt bought). Additional composite tenses are constructed with auxiliary verbs (e.g. at være to be and at have to have) and participial forms:</p><p>Hun er gået
"She has left"


Hun har gået
"She has walked"


Hun var gået
"She had left"


Hun blev siddende
She remained seated (lit. "she stayed sitting")</p><p>The passive form takes the suffix -s: avisen læses hver dag (the newspaper is read every day). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb at blive to become: avisen bliver læst hver dag.[68][69]</p><p>The imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:</p><p>løb!
"run!"</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Danish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is Subject-Verb-Object.[70] However, Danish is also a V2 language, which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian Paul Diderichsen[71] Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or grounding) field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or topics. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.[72]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Peter (S) så (V) Jytte (O)
"Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>but</p><p>I går så (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)
"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>When there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a dummy subject der.[73]</p><p>der kom en pige ind ad døren
there came a girl in through the door
"A girl came in the door"

Main clauses[edit]</p><p>Haberland (1994, p.&nbsp;336) describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:</p><p>Position 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.[72]</p><p>Questions with wh-words are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.</p><p>Wh-question:</p><p>hvem så du?'
who saw you
"who did you see?"


så du ham?
saw you him?
"did you see him?"

Subordinate clauses[edit]</p><p>In subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).[74] Complement clauses begin with the particle at in the connector field.</p><p>Han sagde at han ikke ville gå
he said that he not would go
"He said that he did not want to go"</p><p>Relative clauses are marked by the relative articles som or der which occupy the preverbal slot:</p><p>Jeg kender en mand som bor i Helsingør[75]
"I know a man who lives in Elsinore"</p><h2>Vocabulary[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG/220px-Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Danish label reading militærpoliti, "military police", on police vehicle</p><p>About 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the Old Norse language, and ultimately from Proto Indo-European. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.[76] Danish has also absorbed a considerable number of loan words, most of which were borrowed from Middle Low German in the late medieval period. Out of the 500 most frequently used Words in Danish, 100 are Medieval loans from Middle Low German.[77] In the 17th and 18th Centuries standard German and French superseded Low German influence and in the 20th Century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after World War II. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with æde (to eat) which became less common when the Low German spise came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard text in contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16-17% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4-8&nbsp;%, French 2-4&nbsp;% and English about 1%.[77]</p><p>Danish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, Danish words for commonly used nouns and prepositions are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers, such as have, over, under, for, give, flag, salt, and kat.[78] Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their Scottish equivalents, e.g., kirke (Scottish kirk, i.e., 'church') or barn (Scottish bairn, i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word by, meaning village or town, occurs in many English place-names, such as Whitby and Selby, as remnants of the Viking occupation. During the latter period, English adopted are, the third person plural form of the verb to be, as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form they from contemporary Old Norse.</p><h3>Numerals[edit]</h3><p>In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered enogtyve, literally one and twenty.</p><p>The numeral halvanden means 1½ (literally half second, implying one plus half of the second one). The numerals halvtredje (2½), halvfjerde (3½) and halvfemte (4½) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the vigesimal system described below. Similarly, the temporal designation klokken halv tre, literally half three o'clock, is half past two.</p><p>One peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (somewhat like the French numerals from 80 through 99) based on a vigesimal system, meaning that the score (20) is used as a base unit in counting. Tres (short for tre-sinds-tyve, three times twenty) means 60, while 50 is halvtreds (short for halvtredje-sinds-tyve, half third times twenty, implying two score plus half of the third score). The ending sindstyve meaning times twenty is no longer included in cardinal numbers, but still used in ordinal numbers. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as tooghalvtreds from the now obsolete tooghalvtredsindstyve, whereas 52nd is either tooghalvtredsende or tooghalvtredsindstyvende. Twenty is tyve (derived from old Danish tiughu, a haplology of tuttiughu, meaning 'two tens'[79]), while thirty is tredive (Old Danish þrjatiughu, three tens), and forty is fyrre (Old Danish fyritiughu, four tens[80] via fyrretyve.[81] Thus, the suffix -tyve should be understood as a plural of ti (10), though to modern Danes tyve means 20, making it hard to explain why fyrretyve is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four times twenty).</p><p>For large numbers (one billion or larger), Danish uses the long scale, so that the short scale billion (1,000,000,000) is called milliard, and the short scale trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is billion.</p><h2>Writing system[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Danish orthography</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG/220px-Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Danish keyboard with keys for Æ, Ø, and Å.</p><p>The oldest preserved examples of written Danish (from the Iron and Viking Ages) are in the Runic alphabet.[82] The introduction of Christianity also brought the Latin script to Denmark, and at the end of the High Middle Ages Runes had more or less been replaced by Latin letters.</p><p>Danish orthography is highly conservative, still using most of the conventions established in the 16th century. The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a severe gap between the spoken and written languages.[83]</p><p>The modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: æ, ø, and å, which come at the end of the alphabet, in that order. A spelling reform in 1948 introduced the letter å, already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the digraph aa.[82] The old usage still occurs in some personal and geographical names (for example, the name of the city of Aalborg is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and Aarhus decided to go back to Aa in 2011). When representing the å sound, aa is treated just like å in alphabetical sorting, even though it looks like two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations (e.g., in URLs), they are often replaced by ae (Æ, æ), oe or o (Ø, ø), and aa (Å, å), respectively.</p><p>The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense vilde (would), kunde (could) and skulde (should), to their current forms of ville, kunne and skulle (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech). Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly, particularly with the phonetic spelling of loanwords; for example the spelling of station and garage in Danish remains identical to other languages, whereas in Norwegian, they are transliterated as stasjon and garasje.</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p>Åkesson, K.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The Danish colonial empire (Danish: danske kolonier) and pre Dano-Norwegian empire (Norwegian: Danmark-Norges kolonier) denotes the colonies that Denmark-Norway (Denmark alone after 1814) possessed from 1536 until 1953. At its apex the colonial empire spanned four continents (Europe, South America, Africa and Asia). The period of colonial expansion marked a rise in the status and power of Danes and Norwegians in the union. Being the hegemon of Denmark-Norway or the Statsfædrelandet (lit. State Fathers' Land), Denmark is where the union's monumental palaces are now located and Copenhagen, today the capital of Denmark, was the city which both Norway and Denmark came to establish as their capital. Much of the Norwegian population moved to find work in Copenhagen, attend the University, or join the Royal Fleet. At it height the empire had an area of 2,655,564.76 km2 [1]</p><p>In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in Africa, the Caribbean, and India. After 1814, when Norway was granted to Sweden following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained what remained of Norway's great medieval colonial holdings. Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway's overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe. Denmark-Norway's first colony was established at Tranquebar (Trankebar) on India's southern coast in 1620. Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.</p><p>Today, the only remaining vestiges of this empire are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953. They are now autonomous countries of the Kingdom of Denmark with home rule, in a relationship referred to as the Unity of the Realm.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Overview[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish Gold Coast</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg/250px-Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg" width="250" height="148"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>A contemporary depiction of Fort Christiansborg</p><p>Denmark maintained several tradings stations and four forts on the Gold Coast in west Africa, especially around modern day Ghana. Three trading stations were built:[2] Fort Frederiksborg, Kpompo; Osu Castle by Accra in 1661, that was purchased from Sweden; and Frederiksberg. The forts were Fort Prinsensten built in 1784, Fort Augustaborg from 1787, Fort Friedensborg and Fort Kongensten, several of which are ruins today. Of these, only one is still used today, Fort Christiansborg, which is the Ghanaian president's residence in Ghana.</p><p>Plantations were established by Frederiksborg, but they failed. Fort Christiansborg became the base for Danish power in west Africa, and the centre for slave trade to the Danish West Indies. In 1807, Denmark's African business partners were suppressed by the Akan people subgroup-Ashanti, which led to the abandonment of all trading stations. Denmark sold its forts to the United Kingdom in 1850.</p><h3>Americas[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish colonization of the Americas</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg/220px-H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg" width="220" height="178"><br><p>The Høgensborg estate on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, 1833


Greenland[edit]
Main articles: History of Greenland and Royal Greenland Trade Department</p><p>With the ratification of the Kalmar Union in 1397, Denmark-Norway inherited Greenland which was previously part of Norway since its settlement in the Viking Age. After the Norse settlement in Greenland finally disappeared in the 15th century, Europeans did not settle the island again until 1721, when the Lutheran minister Hans Egede arrived and established the town now known as Nuuk. After Norway was ceded to Sweden in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the old territorial claims as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel.</p><p>The development and settlement of Greenland accelerated in 1945, instigated by the region's geostrategic importance in the Cold War era, itself exemplified and manifested by the US-Air base of Thule from 1943. Another reason and driving force was the emergence of fundamental technical abilities, such as aircraft and icebreakers at Greenland's disposition, giving the otherwise remote island a supply situation somewhat similar to Europe.</p><p>Danish West Indies[edit]
Main articles: Danish West Indies and Danish West India Company</p><p>Denmark-Norway acquired the island of St. Thomas in 1671[2] and St. Jan (now St. John) in 1718, and bought St. Croix from France in 1733. All of the islands' economies were based primarily on sugar. These islands were known as the Danish West Indies and were eventually sold to the United States in 1917 for 25 million dollars.[2] Several Danish-American succession talks had been made since 1870 due to a rising number of riots and unrest from the poorer English speaking population. The Zahle Government (1914-1920) held a heavily boycotted election for Danish mainland constituencies, which produced a minority for the sale of the islands. The United States hoped to use them as naval bases. Since 1917, the islands have been known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish India and Danish East India Company</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png/300px-European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png" width="300" height="184"><br><p>Danish and other European settlements in India.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/250px-A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="250" height="118"><br><p>Fort Dansborg at Tranquebar, built by Ove Gjedde, c. 1658</p><p>Denmark maintained a scattering of small colonies and trading posts throughout the Indian sub-continent from the 17th to 19th centuries, after which most were sold or ceded to Britain which had become the dominant power there.[2] The most important economic aspect was spice trade and access to the east Asian area, including Imperial China situated farther to the east.</p><p>The colony at Trankebar (modern day: Tharangambadi) was kept for over 200 years, with a few interruptions, until it was sold to the British in 1845.</p><p>In 1755 Denmark acquired the Frederiksnagore (now Serampore), and later the towns of Achne and Pirapur. They are located about 25 kilometres north of Calcutta. In 1818 Serampore College was established in Serampore, which still exists today. These towns were also sold to Britain in 1845. Other colonial ventures include colonization attempts of the Nicobar Islands, called Frederiksøerne (Frederik Islands) or Ny Danmark (New Denmark) by the Danes between 1754 and 1868.</p><h3>Atlantic[edit]</h3><p>Faroe Islands[edit]
Main article: History of the Faroe Islands</p><p>As with Greenland, Denmark-Norway inherited the medieval Norwegian claims to the Faroe Islands as the successor state to Norway. The Faroes had become part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. After Norway was given to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the Faroes as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel. Status as a Danish county ended in 1948, and the Faroes were given a large degree of independence within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>Iceland[edit]

Also like those possessions, Iceland was retained by Denmark at the Treaty of Kiel. A growing independence movement in Iceland led to Denmark granting it home rule in 1874 and expanding that home rule in 1904. In 1918 Iceland became a fully sovereign kingdom, titled the Kingdom of Iceland, in personal union with Denmark.</p><p>During Nazi Germany's Occupation of Denmark (1940) the Republic of Iceland was declared on June 17, 1944.</p><h3>Danish Estonia and Courland[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish Estonia and Bishopric of Courland</p><p>In the 13th-14th centuries, Denmark ruled parts of what is now Estonia. The colony was initially named the Duchy of Estonia (Danish: Hertugdømmet Estland) and is retrospectively called Danish Estonia by historians. In 1559 the bishop of Courland and Ösel-Wiek Johannes V von Münchhausen sold his lands to the King Frederick II of Denmark for 30,000 thalers. The Danish king gave the territory to his younger brother Duke Magnus of Holstein. After Magnus of Livonia died in 1583, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth invaded his territories in the Bishopric of Courland and Frederick II of Denmark decided to sell his rights of inheritance. In 1645, Saaremaa was ceded from Denmark to Sweden by the Treaty of Brömsebro.</p><h2>Demise[edit]</h2><p>The downfall of the Danish colonial empire was caused by a lack of resources.[2] The empire was quickly eclipsed by those of France, Britain and the Netherlands. Eventually Denmark sold its colonies in India to Britain.[2]</p><h2>Legacy[edit]</h2><p>Greenland and the Faroe Islands are the last vestiges of the colonial empire. Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953, and it became an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It gained home rule in 1979 and further autonomy, including self-determination, in 2009. Likewise, the Faroes were incorporated into the Kingdom in the eighteenth century, with the status of a county, and then given home rule in 1948.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

				This article is about the Eskimo–Aleut language. For the extinct North Germanic language, see Greenlandic Norse.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut. The main variety, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the Naalakkersuisut (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, Danish. The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic. The Thule Inuit of Greenland, Inuktun or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut.</p><p>Greenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (subject) of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (subject) of a transitive verb.</p><p>Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in transitive clauses is subject–object–verb. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables switch-reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as yesterday or now or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.</p><p>When adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the Thule people in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland.</p><p>The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.[4]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg/350px-Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg.png" width="350" height="313"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.</p><p>From the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.[5]</p><p>From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.[5]</p><p>Another development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of greenlandization of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.[6] Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic. The newspaper Sermitsiaq, has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten, which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.[7][8]</p><p>Before June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish.[note 1] Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language.[2] This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an indigenous language of the Americas that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi-independent country. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be in a vulnerable state by the UNESCO Red Book of Language Endangerment.[9] The country has a 100% literacy rate.[10] As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant, a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect.[11]</p><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><p>Kalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the Eskimo–Aleut family and are closely related to the Inuit languages of Canada and Alaska. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.</p><p>The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut), which is the official language of Greenland. The name Kalaallisut is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, Inuktun (Avanersuarmiutut), spoken in the vicinity of the city of Qaanaaq (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect (Tunumiit oraasiat), spoken in the vicinity of Ammassalik Island and Ittoqqortoormiit, is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.[14] Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around Upernavik has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of Uummannaq and the Disko Bay. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in Sisimiut in the north, around Nuuk and as far south as Maniitsoq. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around Narsaq and Qaqortoq in the south.[4] Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for humans in the three main dialects. It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, maintaining the gh which has been elided in Kalaallisut, and Tunumiisut is the most innovative, having further simplified the structure by eliding the /n/.</p><p>Michael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argues for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and the Eskimo–Aleut languages in Language Relations Across Bering Strait (1998). He calls this proposed grouping the Uralo-Siberian languages.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>See also: Inuit phonology</p><p>Letters between slashes / / indicate phonemic transcription, letters in square brackets [ ] indicate phonetic transcription and letters in triangular brackets ? ? indicate standard Greenlandic orthography.</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg/250px-West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg.png" width="250" height="210"><br><p>Ranges of West Greenlandic monophthongs on a vowel chart.[15]</p><p>The Greenlandic three vowel system, composed of /i/, /u/, and /a/, is typical for an Eskimo–Aleut language. Double vowels are analyzed as two morae, so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.[16][17] The only diphthong in the language is /ai/, which occurs only at the ends of words.[18] Before a uvular consonant ([q] or [?]), /i/ is realized allophonically as [e], [?] or [?], and /u/ is realized allophonically as [o] or [?], and the two vowels are written e, o respectively (as in some orthographies used for Quechua and Aymara).[19] /a/ becomes retracted to [?] in the same environment. /i/ is rounded to [y] before labial consonants.[19] /u/ is fronted to [?] between two coronal consonants.[19]</p><p>The allophonic lowering of /i/ and /u/ before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing /i/ and /u/ as ?e? and ?o? respectively before uvulars ?q? and ?r?. For example:</p><p>/ui/ "husband" pronounced [ui].
/uiqarpuq/ "she has a husband" pronounced [ueq??p?q] and written ?ueqarpoq?.


/illu/ "house" pronounced [i??u].
/illuqarpuq/ "he has a house" pronounced [i??oq??p?q] and written ?illoqarpoq?.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic has consonants at five points of articulation: labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular. It does not have phonemic voicing contrast, but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.[note 2] The earlier palatal sibilant [?] has merged with [s] in all but a few dialects.[20] The labiodental fricative [f] is only contrastive in loanwords. The alveolar stop [t] is pronounced as an affricate [t?s] before the high front vowel /i/. Often, Danish loanwords containing ?b d g? preserve these, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example ?baaja? [pa?ja] beer and ?Guuti? [ku?t?i] God; these are pronounced exactly as /p t k/.[4]</p><h3>Phonological constraints[edit]</h3><p>The Kalaallisut syllable is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word-final /ai/.[21] Native words may only begin with a vowel or /p, t, k, q, s, m, n/; they may end only in /p, t, k, q/ or rarely /n/. Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.[22]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic prosody does not include stress as an autonomous category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters.[17] Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.[23]</p><p>Geminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.[24]</p><p>Intonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.[23][25]</p><h3>Morphophonology[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.</p><p>Greenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is /?/. The first consonant in a cluster is always assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate /tt/ is pronounced [ts] and written ?ts?. Geminate /ll/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [ç?] but is written ?gg?. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /vv/ is pronounced [f?] and written ?ff?. /v/ is also pronounced and written [f] after /?/.[26]</p><p>These assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, iglu (house), is illu in Greenlandic, where the /gl/ consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. And the word Inuktitut itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes Inuttut. The Old Greenlandic diphthong /au/ has assimilated to /aa/.</p><p>The consonant /v/ has disappeared when between /u/ and /i/ or /a/. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without [v] when suffixed to stems ending in /u/.</p><p>The vowel /i/ of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo–Aleut vowels *i and *?. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.[27] In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned morphophonologically in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *? has the variant [a] when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.[28]</p><p>The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, Inuktun, which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (Tunumiit oraasiat) has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. [??] to [t?]. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is Ittoqqortoormiit, which would appear as Illoqqortoormiut in Kalaallisut.[13][14]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg/350px-Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg" width="350" height="263"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to "parking forbidden for all vehicles".</p><p>The morphology of Greenlandic is highly synthetic and exclusively suffixing,[29] with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.[note 5] In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.[30][note 6] The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.[31]</p><p>There are few compound words, but lots of derivations.[32] The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.</p><p>The language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.[33]</p><p>In this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.[34]</p><p>The verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.[34] The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:</p><p>Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:</p><p>Sini-ppoq "(S)he sleeps"

woman.ABS love-3p/3p

Morphosyntactic alignment[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic language uses case to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.[35]</p><p>Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, instead of treating the grammatical relations as in most European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.[36] Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.[37]</p><p>Intransitive:</p><p>Anda sini-ppoq "Anda sleeps"
Anda.ABS sleep-3p/IND</p><p>Transitive with agent and object:</p><p>Anda-p nanoq taku-aa "Anda sees a bear"
Anda.ERG bear-ABS see-3p/3p

Word order[edit]</p><p>In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is AOXV / SXV, where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. Topical noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a focal subject or object as well. In spoken language also afterthought material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.[38]</p><p>On the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.[39]</p><p>In copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa "Anda bought the sweater"
Anda sweater bought
A O V</p><p>An attribute appears after its head noun.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa "Anda bought the blue sweater"

Coordination and Subordination[edit]</p><p>Syntactic coordination and subordination is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.[40] The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.[41]</p><p>Obviation and switch-reference[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as obviation[42] or switch-reference.[43] There is a special so-called fourth person[44] used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.[45] Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>illu-a taku-aa "he saw his (the other man's) house"

Indefiniteness construction[edit]</p><p>There is no category of definiteness in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors, morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive[46][47] or intransitive object[48] conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.[49][50] This view, however, is controversial.[51]</p><p>Active:</p><p>Piitap arfeq takuaa "Peter saw the whale"
Peter-ERG whale see</p><p>Antipassive/intransitive object:</p><p>Piitaq arfermik takuvoq "Peter saw (a) whale"
Peter-ABS whale-INSTR see</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>The morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are inflection and derivation. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and voice (tense/aspect is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).[52][53][54] Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by adverbs in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as postbases rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.[55] Such semantically heavy suffixes may express concepts such as to have, to be, to say, or to think. The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.</p><p>Inflection[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.[56] The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.[57]</p><p>Indicative and interrogative moods[edit]</p><p>The indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing questions. Questions with the question particle immaqa maybe cannot use the interrogative mood.[58]</p><p>napparsima-vit? "Are you sick?"

The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).</p><p>Table 6 shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb asa- to love (an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection).</p><p>Imperative and Optative moods[edit]</p><p>The imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.[59]</p><p>sini-git! "Sleep!"

Causative mood[edit]</p><p>The causative mood (sometimes called the conjunctive) is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning because, since or when; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of that. The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.[61]</p><p>qasu-gami innar-poq "He went to bed because he was tired"

Contemporative mood[edit]</p><p>The contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.[62]</p><p>qasu-llunga angerlar-punga "Being tired, I went home"

Participial mood[edit]</p><p>The participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.[63]</p><p>atuar-toq taku-ara "I saw her read/I saw that she read"

Derivation[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Verbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.</p><p>-katap- be tired of</p><p>taku-katap-para "I am tired of seeing it/him/her"

Time reference and aspect[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,[64] and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of tense markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:[65]</p><p>toqo-riikatap-poq "He died long ago"[66]
die-long.ago-3p/IND
nere-qqammer-punga "I ate recently"[66]
eat-recently-I/IND
ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq "Yesterday Peter was running."[67]
yesterday Peter-ABS run-3p/IND</p><p>All other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal aktionsart.[67]</p><p>Piitaq arpap-poq "Peter runs"[67]
Peter-ABS run-3p/IND
Piitaq ani-voq "Peter was gone out"[67]
Peter-ABS go.out-3p/IND</p><p>But if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.[68]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. sar expressing habituality and ssaar expressing stop to.[69] Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: sima and nikuu. sima can occur in several positions with obviously different function[70] Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.</p><p>tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq "Apparently, she had arrived"[71]
arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/INT</p><p>With atelic verbs, there is a regular contrast between indirective evidentiality marked by sima and witnessed evidentiality marked by nikuu.[72] Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and sima sometimes is marked.[73]</p><p>qia-sima-voq "He cried (his eyes are swollen)"
cry-SIMA-3p/IND
qia-nikuu-voq "He cried (I was there)"
cry-NIKUU-3p/IND[72]</p><p>In the written language[66] and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.[74] That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.</p><p>Just as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:</p><p>e.g. Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu "I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer."

expect-I/3p/IND summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p



 

e.g. Aggiuti-ler-para "I've started to bring him."

bring-begin-I/3p/IND



 

e.g. Qimmi-t nirukkar-niar-nigik "Let us feed the dogs, ok?"[76]

dog-PL feed-please-we/them/IMP</p><p>While the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.[77][78] However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.[79]</p><p>Noun incorporation[edit]</p><p>There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.[47][80][81][82][83][84] This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.[85] Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.[86][87][88] The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>qimmeq dog + -qar- have (+ -poq 3p)</p><p>qimme-qar-poq "She has a dog"</p><p>illu house + -'lior- make</p><p>illu-lior-poq "She builds a house"</p><p>kaffi coffee + -sor- drink/eat</p><p>kaffi-sor-poq "She drinks coffee"</p><p>puisi seal + -nniar- hunt</p><p>puisi-nniar-poq "She hunts seal"</p><p>allagaq letter + -si- receive</p><p>allagar-si-voq "She has received a letter"</p><p>anaana mother + -a- to be</p><p>anaana-a-voq "She is a mother"</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.[89] Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. atuar- to read + -fik place becomes atuarfik school and atuarfik + -tsialak something good becomes atuarfitsialak good school.</p><p>The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.[90][note 10]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>There are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.[91]</p><p>Personal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:</p><p>ilin-nut niri-qu-aa
thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.
'He told you to eat it'

Case[edit]</p><p>The two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.</p><p>angu-t neri-voq "The man eats"

Possession[edit]</p><p>In Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.[97] Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of illu house.

Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word palasi priest is a loan from the Danish præst. But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. qarasaasiaq computer which literally means artificial brain. This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.[4] For example the root for tongue oqaq is used to derive the following words:</p><p>Lexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.[4]</p><h2>Orthography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG/220px-%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>? in a Greenlandic–Danish dictionary from 1926</p><p>Greenlandic is written with the Latin script.

This alphabet employed the special character kra (?' / ?) which was replaced by q in the 1973 reform.[100] In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name Kalaallit Nunaat was spelled Kalâdlit Nunât. This scheme uses a circumflex accent ( ˆ ) to indicate a long vowel (e.g., ât/ît/ût, modern: aat, iit, uut), an acute accent ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e., á, í, ú modern: a(kk), i(kk), u(kk))] and, finally, a tilde ( ˜ ) or a grave accent ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g., ãt, it, ut or àt, ìt, ùt, modern: aatt, iitt, uutt). The letters ê and ô, used only before r and q, are now written ee and oo in Greenlandic. The spelling system of Nunatsiavummiutut, spoken in Nunatsiavut in northeastern Labrador, is derived from the old Greenlandic system.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)[101] whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.</p><h3>Sample text[edit]</h3><p>Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik.

				For other people with the same name, see Margaret of Denmark (disambiguation).</p><p>Margrethe II (Danish: Margrethe 2., pronounced&nbsp;[m?'g?æ??d?]; Faroese: Margreta 2.; Greenlandic: Margrethe II; full name: Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid; born 16 April 1940) is the Queen of Denmark. She is also the supreme authority of the Church of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defence Forces. Born into the House of Glücksburg, a royal house with origins in Northern Germany, she was the eldest child of Frederick IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden. She succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972, having had become heir presumptive to her father in 1953, when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. On her accession, Margrethe became the first female monarch of Denmark since Margaret I, ruler of the Scandinavian countries in 1375–1412 during the Kalmar Union. In 1967, she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, with whom she has two sons: Crown Prince Frederik (born 1968) and Prince Joachim (born 1969). She has been on the Danish throne for 45 years, becoming the second longest-reigning Danish monarch after her ancestor Christian IV.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Amalienborg_cph.jpg/220px-Amalienborg_cph.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg, photographed in 2006</p><p>Princess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as the first child of Crown Prince Frederick, later King Frederick IX and Crown Princess Ingrid, later Queen Ingrid. Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, and Crown Princess Margaret, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her birth took place just one week after Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940.[2]</p><p>She was baptised on 14 May in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen.[2] The Princess's godparents were: King Christian X (paternal grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V of Sweden (maternal great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (maternal grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (her maternal uncle); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (maternal grandmother's father).</p><p>She was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, Queen Alexandrine, and Ingrid after her mother, Crown Princess Ingrid. Since her paternal grandfather was also the King of Iceland, she was given an Icelandic name, Þórhildur (Thorhildur).[3]</p><p>When Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her first sister, Princess Benedikte, was born. Princess Benedikte later married Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister Princess Anne Marie was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married Constantine II of Greece and now lives in Greece.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Margrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at Gråsten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.</p><h2>Heir presumptive[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg/220px-Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg" width="220" height="270"><br><p>Princess Margrethe in 1966.</p><p>At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the Glücksburg branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle Prince Knud would one day assume the throne.</p><p>The process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new Act of Succession permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive.[2]</p><p>On her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the Council of State. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.[2]</p><p>In 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to Los Angeles, and to the Paramount Studios, where they were met by several celebrities, including Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley.[4]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><p>Margrethe was educated at the private school N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen from which she graduated in 1959. She spent a year at North Foreland Lodge, a boarding school for girls in Hampshire, England,[5] and later studied prehistoric archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge, during 1960–1961, political science at Aarhus University between 1961 and 1962, attended the Sorbonne in 1963, and was at the London School of Economics in 1965.[6] She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[2]</p><p>Queen Margrethe is fluent in Danish, French, English, Swedish and German, and has a limited knowledge of Faroese.[2][6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Marriage and children[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg/220px-Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Queen Margrethe II and her consort, Prince Henrik, in 2010.</p><p>Princess Margrethe married a French diplomat, Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, 10 June 1967, at the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen. Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish throne.[2]</p><p>Margrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son Frederik. A second child, named Joachim, was born 7 June 1969.[2]</p><h2>Reign[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Faroe_stamp_302_Queen_Margrethe.jpg/200px-Faroe_stamp_302_Queen_Margrethe.jpg" width="200" height="308"><br><p>Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the Faroese people. Stamp FR 302 of Postverk Føroya, Faroe Islands, issued 14 January 1997.</p><h3>Succession[edit]</h3><p>Shortly after King Frederick IX had delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he fell ill. At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne, becoming the first female Danish sovereign under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace 15 January 1972, by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style By the Grace of God, Queen of Denmark (Danish: Margrethe den Anden, af Guds Nåde Danmarks Dronning). The Queen chose the motto: God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.[6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said:</p><p>My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.[7]</p><h3>Constitutional role[edit]</h3><p>The Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc.</p><p>As an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.[2]</p><p>After an election where the incumbent Prime Minister does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a “Dronningerunde” (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the Danish political parties.[8]</p><p>Each party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal Det Radikale Venstre did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the Folketing, is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history that any party has held a majority on its own.)</p><p>Once the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State (privy council), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the Cabinet of Denmark.</p><p>In addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires), an infantry regiment of the British Army, following a tradition in her family.[2]</p><h3>Ruby Jubilee[edit]</h3><p>Queen Margrethe II celebrated her Ruby Jubilee, the 40th year on the throne, 14 January 2012.[9] This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace and numerous TV interviews.</p><h3>Immigration debate[edit]</h3><p>In 2016 an interview within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.[10][11]</p><h2>Personal life and interests[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official residences of the Queen and the Prince Consort are Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen and Fredensborg Palace. Their summer residence is Gråsten Palace near Sønderborg, the former home of the Queen's mother, Queen Ingrid, who died in 2000.</p><p>Margrethe is an accomplished painter, and has held many art shows over the years. Her illustrations—under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer—were used for the Danish edition of The Lord of the Rings, which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to J. R. R. Tolkien who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's poetry collection Cantabile. She is also an accomplished translator and is said to have participated in the Danish translation of The Lord of the Rings.[6] Another skill she possesses is costume designing, having designed the costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet's production of A Folk Tale and for the 2009 Peter Flinth film, De vilde svaner (The Wild Swans).[2][12] She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices. Margrethe also wears designs by former Pierre Balmain designer Erik Mortensen, Jørgen Bender, and Birgitte Taulow.[13] The Guardian in March 2013 listed her as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s.[14]</p><p>Margrethe is a chain smoker, and she is famous for her tobacco habit.[15] However, on 23 November 2006, the Danish newspaper B.T. reported an announcement from the Royal Court stating that in future the Queen would smoke only in private.[16]</p><p>A statement in a 2005 authorized biography about the Queen (entitled Margrethe) focused on her views of Islam: We are being challenged by Islam these years. Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction.[17]</p><p>Queen Margrethe II visited the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, in Nanjing, April 27, 2014. The Queen said the Memorial Hall records the darkest part of history in 77 years. We cannot change the cruel history, but can learn a historic lesson and experience from it. Today, we commemorate Sindberg. We need not only to review the past, but also need to face up to the future, she said. Margrethe II and Prince Henrik watered a tree symbolizing peace, on the square outside the Memorial Hall. They also laid down a yellow rose, named by Sindberg’s hometown as Forever Nanjing, Sindberg Yellow Rose in 2004.</p><h2>Family[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish Royal Family</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg/220px-Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Her Majesty surrounded by her family waving to crowds on her 70th birthday in April 2010.

<div class="content"><p>Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner project during the 1960s. The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight.[166] In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue Concorde flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).[167]</p><p>The aerospace industry remains a major sector of the local economy.[168] Major aerospace companies in Bristol include BAE Systems, a merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and BAe (the latter a merger of BAC, Hawker Siddeley and Scottish Aviation). Airbus[169] and Rolls-Royce are also based at Filton, and aerospace engineering is an area of research at the University of the West of England. Another aviation company in the city is Cameron Balloons, who manufacture hot air balloons;[170] each August the city hosts the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, one of Europe's largest hot-air balloon festivals.[171]</p><p>In 2005 Bristol was named by the UK government one of England's six science cities.[172][173] A £500&nbsp;million shopping centre, Cabot Circus, opened in 2008 amidst predictions by developers and politicians that the city would become one of England's top ten retail destinations.[174] The Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries around Bristol Temple Meads railway station,[175] was announced in 2011[176] and launched the following year.[175] The 70-hectare (170-acre) Urban Enterprise Zone has streamlined planning procedures and reduced business rates. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other designated enterprise areas in the region:[177] Avonmouth, Bath, Bristol and Bath Science Park in Emersons Green, Filton, and Weston-super-Mare. Bristol is the only big city whose wealth per capita is higher than that of Britain as a whole. With a highly skilled workforce drawn from its universities, Bristol claims to have the largest cluster of computer chip designers and manufacturers outside Silicon Valley. The wider region has one of the biggest aerospace hubs in the UK, centred on Airbus, Rolls-Royce and GKN at Filton airfield.[178]</p><br><img alt="A panoramic view looking over a cityscape of office blocks, old buildings, church spires and a multi-story car park.

Some of the modern venues and modern digital production companies have merged with legacy production companies based in old buildings around the city. In 2008 the city was a finalist for the 2008 European Capital of Culture, although the title was awarded to Liverpool.[179]</p><p>The Bristol Old Vic, founded in 1946 as an offshoot of The Old Vic in London, occupies the 1766 Theatre Royal (607 seats) on King Street; the 150-seat New Vic (a studio-type theatre), and a foyer and bar in the adjacent Coopers' Hall (built in 1743). The Theatre Royal, a grade I listed building,[180][181] is the oldest continuously operating theatre in England.[182] The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (which originated in King Street) is a separate company, and the Bristol Hippodrome is a 1,951-seat theatre for national touring productions. Other smaller theatres include the Tobacco Factory, QEH, the Redgrave Theatre at Clifton College and the Alma Tavern. Bristol's theatre scene features several companies as well as the Old Vic, including Show of Strength, Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory and Travelling Light. Theatre Bristol is a partnership between the city council, Arts Council England and local residents to develop the city's theatre industry.[183] Several organisations support Bristol theatre; the Residence (an artist-led community) provides office, social and rehearsal space for theatre and performance companies,[184] and Equity has a branch in the city.[185]</p><p>The city has many venues for live music, its largest the 2,000-seat Colston Hall named after Edward Colston. Others include the Bristol Academy, The Fleece, The Croft, the Exchange, Fiddlers, the Victoria Rooms, Trinity Centre, St George's Bristol and several pubs, from the jazz-oriented The Old Duke to rock at the Fleece and indie bands at the Louisiana.[186][187] In 2010 PRS for Music called Bristol the UK's most musical city, based on the number of its members born there relative to the city's population.[188] Since the late 1970s Bristol has been home to bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, and trip hop and Bristol Sound artists such as Tricky,[189] Portishead[190] and Massive Attack;[191] the list of bands from Bristol is extensive. The city is a stronghold of drum and bass, with artists such as Roni Size's Mercury Prize-winning Reprazent,[192] as DJ Krust[193] and More Rockers.[194] This music is part of the Bristol urban-culture scene which received international media attention during the 1990s.[195]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery houses a collection encompassing natural history, archaeology, local glassware, Chinese ceramics and art. The M Shed museum opened in 2011 on the site of the former Bristol Industrial Museum.[196] Both are operated by Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, which also runs three historic houses?—?the Tudor Red Lodge, the Georgian House and Blaise Castle House?—?and Bristol Archives.[197] The 18th- and 19th-century portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, 19th-century architect Francis Greenway (designer of many of Sydney's first buildings) were born in the city. The graffiti artist Banksy is believed to be from Bristol, and many of his works are on display in the city.[198]</p><p>The Watershed Media Centre and Arnolfini gallery (both in dockside warehouses) exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema, and the city's oldest gallery is at the Royal West of England Academy in Clifton.[199] The nomadic Antlers Gallery opened in 2010, moving into empty spaces on Park Street, on Whiteladies Road and in the Purifier House on Bristol's Harbourside.[200] Stop motion animation films and commercials (produced by Aardman Animations) are made in Bristol.[201] Bristol is home to the regional headquarters of BBC West and the BBC Natural History Unit.[202] Locations in and around Bristol have featured in the BBC's natural-history programmes, including Animal Magic (filmed at Bristol Zoo).[203]</p><p>Bristol is the birthplace of 18th-century poets Robert Southey[204] and Thomas Chatterton.[205] Southey (born on Wine Street in 1774) and his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, married the Fricker sisters from the city.[206] William Wordsworth spent time in Bristol,[207] where Joseph Cottle published Lyrical Ballads in 1798. Actor Cary Grant was born in Bristol and comedians from the city include Justin Lee Collins,[208] Lee Evans,[209] Lloyd Langford,[210][211] Russell Howard[212] and writer-comedian Stephen Merchant.[213]</p><h3>Architecture[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Buildings and architecture of Bristol</p><br><img alt="Large, square two-storey house at the end of a dirt path" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Kings_Weston_House%2C_Bristol._The_Garden_Front._Sir_John_Vanbrugh%2C_1712.jpg/220px-Kings_Weston_House%2C_Bristol._The_Garden_Front._Sir_John_Vanbrugh%2C_1712.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Garden front of John Vanbrugh's Kings Weston House, Bristol</p><br><img alt="A seventeenth-century timber-framed building with three gables and a traditional inn sign showing a picture of a sailing barge.

During the mid-19th century Bristol Byzantine, a style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen in the city. Surviving elements of the fortifications and castle date to the medieval period,[215] and the Church of St James dates back to the 12th century.[216]</p><p>The oldest Grade I listed buildings in Bristol are religious. St James' Priory was founded in 1129 as a Benedictine priory by Earl Robert of Gloucester, the illegitimate son of Henry I.[217] The second oldest is Bristol Cathedral and its associated Great Gatehouse.[218] Founded in 1140, the church became the seat of the bishop and cathedral of the new Diocese of Bristol in 1542. Most of the medieval stonework, particularly the Elder Lady Chapel, is made from limestone taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas.[219] Amongst the other churches included in the list is the 12th century St Mary Redcliffe which is the tallest building in Bristol. The church was described by Queen Elizabeth I as the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.[220]</p><p>Secular buildings include The Red Lodge, built in 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge for a larger house that once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in Georgian times and restored in the early 20th century.[221] St Bartholomew's Hospital is a 12th-century town house which was incorporated into a monastery hospital founded in 1240 by Sir John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr (c.?1277–1347), and became Bristol Grammar School from 1532 to 1767, and then Queen Elizabeth's Hospital 1767–1847. The round piers predate the hospital, and may come from an aisled hall, the earliest remains of domestic architecture in the city, which was then adapted to form the hospital chapel.[222] Three 17th-century town houses which were attached to the hospital were incorporated into model workers' flats in 1865, and converted to offices in 1978. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652[223] to provide care for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow[224] on King Street and the Hatchet Inn.[225]</p><p>Manor houses include Goldney Hall, where the highly decorated Grotto dates from 1739.[226] Commercial buildings such as the Exchange[227] and Old Post Office[228] from the 1740s are also included in the list. Residential buildings include the Georgian Portland Square[229] and the complex of small cottages around a green at Blaise Hamlet, which was built around 1811 for retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House.[230] The 18th-century Kings Weston House, in northern Bristol, was designed by John Vanbrugh and is the only Vanbrugh building in any UK city outside London. Almshouses[231] and pubs from the same period[232] intermingle with modern development. Several Georgian squares were designed for the middle class as prosperity increased during the 18th century.[233] During World War II, the city centre was heavily bombed during the Bristol Blitz.[234] The central shopping area near Wine Street and Castle Street was particularly hard-hit, and the Dutch House and St Peter's Hospital were destroyed. Nevertheless, in 1961 John Betjeman called Bristol the most beautiful, interesting and distinguished city in England.[235]</p><h3>Sport[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Sport in Bristol</p><p>Bristol has teams representing all the major national sports. Bristol City and Bristol Rovers are the city's main football clubs. Bristol Rugby (Rugby Union) and Gloucestershire County Cricket Club are also based in the city.</p><p>The two Football League clubs are Bristol City and Bristol Rovers?—?the former being the only club from the city to play in the precursor to the Premier League. Non-league clubs include Mangotsfield United, Bristol Manor Farm and Brislington. Bristol City, formed in 1897, were Division One runners-up in 1907 and lost the FA Cup final in 1909. In the First Division in 1976, they then sank to the bottom professional tier before reforming after a 1982 bankruptcy. Bristol City were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007, losing to Hull City in the playoff for promotion to the Premier League that season.[236]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="In the foreground twentieth century housing can be seen amidst trees and on the right a tower block of flats.

They were third-tier champions twice (Division Three South in 1952–53 and Division Three in 1989–90), Watney Cup Winners (1972) and runners-up for the Johnstone's Paint Trophy (2006–07) although have never played in England's top Division. The club has planning permission for a new 21,700-capacity all-seater stadium at the University of the West of England's Frenchay campus. Construction was due to begin in mid-2014, but in March 2015 the sale of the Memorial Stadium site (needed to finance the new stadium) was in jeopardy.[237][238] Bristol Academy Women's Football Club is based at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.[239]</p><p>The city is also home to Bristol Rugby,[240] formed in 1888 as Bristol Football Club by the merger of the Carlton club with rival Redland Park. Westbury Park declined the merger and folded, with many of its players joining Bristol.[241] Bristol Rugby has often competed at the highest level of the sport since its formation in 1888.[242] The club played at the Memorial Ground, which it shared with Bristol Rovers from 1996. Although Bristol Rugby owned the stadium when the football club arrived, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes led to a transfer of ownership to Bristol Rovers. In 2014 Bristol Rugby moved to their new home, Ashton Gate Stadium (home to Bristol Rovers' rivals Bristol City), for the 2014–15 season.[243][244] Dating from 1901, the Bristol Combination and its 53 clubs promote rugby union in the city and help support Bristol Rugby.[245] The most prominent of Bristol's smaller rugby clubs include Clifton Rugby, Dings Crusaders, and Cleve. Rugby league is represented in Bristol by the Bristol Sonics.[246]</p><p>The first-class cricket club Gloucestershire County Cricket Club[247] has its headquarters and plays the majority of its home games at the Bristol County Ground, the only major international sports venue in the south west of England. It was formed by the family of W. G. Grace.[248] The club is arguably Bristol's most successful, achieving a period of success between 1999 and 2006 when it won nine trophies and became the most formidable one-day outfit in England, including winning a double double in 1999 and 2000 (both the Benson and Hedges Cup and the C&amp;G Trophy), and the Sunday League in 2000. Gloucestershire CCC also won the Royal London One-Day Cup in 2015.</p><p>The Bristol Flyers basketball team have competed in the British Basketball League, the UK's premier professional basketball league, since 2014.[249] Bristol Aztecs play in Britain's premier American football competition, the BAFA National Leagues.[250] In 2009 ice hockey returned to Bristol after a 17-year absence, with the Bristol Pitbulls playing at Bristol Ice Rink; after its closure, it shared a venue with Oxford City Stars.[251] Bristol sponsors an annual half marathon and hosted the 2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.[252] Athletic clubs in Bristol include Bristol and West AC, Bitton Road Runners and Westbury Harriers. Bristol has staged finishes and starts of the Tour of Britain cycle race[253] and facilities in the city were used as training camps for the 2012 London Olympics.[254] The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, a major UK hot-air ballooning event, is held each summer at Ashton Court.[255]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="A large number of hot air balloons taking off from a field which is surrounded by tents and stalls.

These include nature documentaries, including The Blue Planet and Planet Earth. The city has a long association with David Attenborough's authored documentaries, including Life on Earth.[256]</p><p>Bristol has two daily newspapers, the Western Daily Press and the Bristol Post; a weekly free newspaper, the Bristol Observer; and a Bristol edition of the free Metro newspaper. All are owned by the Trinity Mirror Group. The Bristol Mercury was published from 1716 and 1909.[257]</p><p>The city has several radio stations, including BBC Radio Bristol. Bristol's television productions include Points West for BBC West, Endemol productions such as Deal or No Deal, The Crystal Maze, and ITV News West Country for ITV West &amp; Wales (formerly HTV West) and ITV Westcountry. The hospital drama Casualty, formerly filmed in Bristol, moved to Cardiff in 2012.[258]</p><p>Publishers in the city have included 18th-century Bristolian Joseph Cottle, who helped introduce Romanticism by publishing the works of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.[259] During the 19th century, J.W. Arrowsmith published the Victorian comedies Three Men in a Boat (by Jerome K. Jerome) and The Diary of a Nobody by George and Weedon Grossmith.[260] The contemporary Redcliffe Press has published over 200 books covering all aspects of th<br>

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The coat of arms of Greenland is a blue shield featuring a silver polar bear. This symbol was first introduced in the coat of arms of Denmark in 1666[1] and it is still represented in the arms of the Danish royal family. In a Danish context, the bear was originally shown walking naturally, but an upright position was specified in 1819. The 1470 London Roll shows an arms captioned Le Roy de Greneland featuring a shield depicting a polar bear surrounded by three birds. This royal title did not reflect any official title, but merely that the arms could be used by anyone controlling Greenland.[2]</p><p>The version currently used by the government of Greenland was designed by Greenlandic artist Jens Rosing and adopted on May 1, 1989 by the Landsting. The polar bear symbolizes the fauna of Greenland and the blue (azure) colour designates the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean Greenland is washed by. Instead of the Danish version in the royal arms which follows the heraldic tradition in raising the right forepaw, the polar bear on the Greenlandic coat of arms raises the left forepaw, due to the traditional Inuit belief that polar bears are left-handed.[3] A similar arms is used by the official Danish government representative in Greenland. In this case, the bear raises its right paw, and the shield is crowned with the royal crown.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official Danish specification of the arms does not specify which forepaw is raised, so there is no conflict between the different versions.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Nuuk (Greenlandic pronunciation:&nbsp;[nu?k]; Danish: Godthåb)[2] is the capital and largest city of Greenland and the municipality of Sermersooq. It is the seat of government and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains almost a third of Greenland's population, and also has the tallest building in Greenland. Nuuk is the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2016, it had a population of 17,316,[3] making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population.</p><p>Nuuk is the Kalaallisut word for cape. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°10' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, located only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. Since 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the new Sermersooq municipality,[4] linking the town centre with the outlying districts and neighborhoods[5] of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa.[6] In 2012 the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk. The campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland, and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland[7] is located at the northern end of the district, near the road to the Nuuk Airport.[8]</p><p>Nuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[9][10]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq.[11] For a long time it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Viking explorers in the 10th century (Western Settlement), and shortly thereafter by Inuit peoples.[12] Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the Norse settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Egede_nuuk.JPG/200px-Egede_nuuk.JPG" width="200" height="134"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>The statue of Hans Egede in Nuuk.</p><p>The city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony (Haabets Koloni) from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Danish colony under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[13] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[14] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[15] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940 when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[16]</p><p>In 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (Danish: Nye-Hernhut). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864),[17] before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.[18]</p><p>Around 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and perceived the Greenlanders had lost much of their culture and identity under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the Atuagagdliutt, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became significant for the Greenlandic identity.</p><p>During World War II, there was a reawakening to Greenlandic national identity. Greenlanders shared a written language and assembled a council under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. Under new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernise Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[19]</p><p>An article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[20] suggested worldwide,</p><p>One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland’s population of 58,000 is Inuit, and least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[20]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>See also: Nuup Kangerlua</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Godthaabsfjord.jpg/200px-Godthaabsfjord.jpg" width="200" height="134"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Nuukair.jpg/200px-Nuukair.jpg" width="200" height="133"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Left: Satellite view.

Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at 64°43'N 50°37'W? / ?64.717°N 50.617°W? / 64.717; -50.617, splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua.[23] The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately 64°03'N 51°58'W? / ?64.050°N 51.967°W? / 64.050; -51.967. Some 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) to the northeast, reaching a height of 1,210&nbsp;m (3,970&nbsp;ft), Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper Sermitsiaq. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, 790&nbsp;m (2,590&nbsp;ft), and Lille Malene, 420&nbsp;m (1,380&nbsp;ft).[24] The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.[25][26]</p><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>Nuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen ET) with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. On 22 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 and sets at 14:20. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 03:00 and does not set until 00:00. Nuuk can get mild temperatures on brief occasions year round, with each month having recorded 13&nbsp;°C (55&nbsp;°F) or warmer. The monthly averages range from -7.5&nbsp;°C (18.5&nbsp;°F) to 8&nbsp;°C (46&nbsp;°F), whereas all-time extremes range from -32.5&nbsp;°C (-26.5&nbsp;°F) to 26.3&nbsp;°C (79.3&nbsp;°F).</p><p>The climate (6.5&nbsp;°C (43.7&nbsp;°F) in July) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees (10&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees[30] which do not sustain well.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>With 16,992 inhabitants as of 2015[update], Nuuk is by far the largest and fastest growing town in Greenland. Despite an overall decline in the country's population, there was an increase of 174 from 2014 to 2015.[31] Nuuk, Paamiut[citation needed] and Tasiilaq are the only towns in the Sermersooq commune (a third of Greenland) which have grown steadily over the last two decades. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, 3,636 were born outside the country.[32] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[33] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[24]</p><h2>Government and politics[edit]</h2><p>As the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative centre of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[24]</p><p>As of December 2015, the mayor of Nuuk is Asii Chemnitz Narup. She is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[34]</p><p>Greenland's Self Government Parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms.[35] All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women's Party.[36]</p><h3>KANUKOKA[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: KANUKOKA</p><p>KANUKOKA (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaanni Kommunit Kattuffiat) is based in Nuuk.

The organisation runs the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2012. All municipal authorities in Greenland are members of the organisation.[38] The association is overseen by Maliina Abelsen, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.[37][39]</p><h2>Economy and infrastructure[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Nuuk-port.jpg/220px-Nuuk-port.jpg" width="220" height="108"><br><p>The port of Nuuk</p><p>Although only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbour but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[40] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US $7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[24] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.</p><p>The city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[41]</p><h3>Energy[edit]</h3><p>All of Greenland's electricity is powered by the government owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[42] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132&nbsp;kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376&nbsp;m (17,638&nbsp;ft), the world's longest free span.[43][44]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg/220px-Ilisimatusarfik-university-of-greenland.jpg" width="220" height="88"><br><p>University of Greenland</p><p>Nuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning.

"Ethnicities" redirects here. It is not to be confused with the academic journal.</p><p>An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestral, language, social, cultural or national experiences.[1][2] Ethnicity is often an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. In some cases, it can be adopted if a person moves into another society[citation needed]. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language or dialect, symbolic systems such as religion, mythology and ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, and physical appearance.</p><p>Ethnic groups, derived from the same historical founder population, often continue to speak related languages and share a similar gene pool. By way of language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion, it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to leave one ethnic group and become part of another (except for ethnic groups emphasizing racial purity as a key membership criterion).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Ethnicity is often used synonymously with ambiguous terms such as nation or people. In English, it can also have the connotation of something exotic (cf. White ethnic, ethnic restaurant, etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the founding population of an area was established.</p><p>The largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals (Han Chinese being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous indigenous peoples worldwide). Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as tribes or clans, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a pan-ethnicity, and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Nileshwar_22.jpg/220px-Nileshwar_22.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Ethnic saris in Kerala</p><p>The term ethnic is derived from the Greek word ????? ethnos (more precisely, from the adjective ??????? ethnikos,[3] which was loaned into Latin as ethnicus). The inherited English language term for this concept is folk, used alongside the latinate people since the late Middle English period.</p><p>In Early Modern English and until the mid-19th century, ethnic was used to mean heathen or pagan (in the sense of disparate nations which did not yet participate in the Christian oikumene), as the Septuagint used ta ethne (the nations) to translate the Hebrew goyim the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews.[4] The Greek term in early antiquity (Homeric Greek) could refer to any large group, a host of men, a band of comrades as well as a swarm or flock of animals. In Classical Greek, the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by ethnic group, mostly translated as nation, people; only in Hellenistic Greek did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to foreign or barbarous nations in particular (whence the later meaning heathen, pagan).[5]</p><p>In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of peculiar to a race, people or nation, in a return to the original Greek meaning. The sense of different cultural groups, and in American English racial, cultural or national minority group arises in the 1930s to 1940s,[6] serving as a replacement of the term race which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological racism. The abstract ethnicity had been used for paganism in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an ethnic character (first recorded 1953). The term ethnic group was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.[7] Depending on the context that is used, the term nationality may either be used synonymously with ethnicity, or synonymously with citizenship (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called ethnogenesis, a term in use in ethnological literature since about 1950.</p><p>Depending on which source of group identity is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In many cases – for instance, the sense of Jewish peoplehood&nbsp;– more than one aspect determines membership.</p><h2>Definitions and conceptual history[edit]</h2><p>Ethnography begins in classical antiquity; after early authors like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus, Herodotus in ca. 480 BC laid the foundation of both historiography and ethnography of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own ethnicity, which they grouped under the name of Hellenes. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating</p><li>shared descent (?µa?µ?? - homaimon, of the same blood),[8]</li><li>shared language (?µ????ss?? - homoglosson, speaking the same language)[9]</li><li>shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: ?e?? ?d??µat? te ????? ?a? ??s?a? - theon hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)[10]</li><li>shared customs (Greek: ??ea ?µ?t??pa - ethea homotropa, customs of like fashion).[11][12][13]</li><p>Whether ethnicity qualifies as a cultural universal is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. According to Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality, in Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics and Reality&nbsp;: Proceedings of the Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, April 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, Department of Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993,[14] a conference organised by Statistics Canada and the United States Census Bureau (April 1–3, 1992).[15] Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16][irrelevant citation]</p><p>According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.</p><p>According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.[25]</p><p>Max Weber maintained that ethnic groups were künstlich (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called race.[26]</p><p>Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose Ethnic Groups and Boundaries from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s.[27] Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical a prioris to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: ...&nbsp;categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories.</p><p>In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of ethnic groups in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>...&nbsp;the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed.[27]</p><p>In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as cultural or tribal when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that ethnicity had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning ethnic identity (like earlier claims concerning tribal identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.[27]</p><p>According to Paul James, formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:</p><p>[C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.[28]</p><p>Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.[29] Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness.[27] He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) Ethnicity&nbsp;... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.[27] This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.</p><h3>Approaches to understanding ethnicity[edit]</h3><p>Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. Examples of such approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.</p><p>Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.[16] Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although historians and cultural anthropologists have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.[36]</p><p>Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as subcultures, interest groups or social classes, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of endogamy resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a mythological narrative of a founding figure); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to boundary markers - characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.[37][38][39][40][41]</p><h3>Ethnicity theory[edit]</h3><p>Ethnicity theory says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification.[42] This theory was put forth by sociologist Robert E. Park in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of “culture”.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>This theory was preceded by over a century where biological essentialism was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation of scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used was the measurement of cranial capacity.[43]</p><p>Ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture.</p><p>Michael Omi and Howard Winant's theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country.[44] While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process&nbsp;– contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation&nbsp;– it did so only for white ethnic communities.[44] The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact.</p><p>And assimilation&nbsp;– shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture&nbsp;– did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others.[44] Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities.[45] It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S.[46] In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a “benign neglect” of social inequality.[46]</p><h2>Ethnicity and nationality[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Nation state and minority group</p><p>In some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner[47] and Benedict Anderson[48] see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of nation-states in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries. Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.</p><p>In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent nations. Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state.[49] Under these conditions&nbsp;– when people moved from one state to another,[50] or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries&nbsp;– ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Multi-ethnic states can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation state. Examples for the first case are found throughout Africa, where countries created during decolonisation inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as Belgium or United Kingdom. Examples for the second case are countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, which were ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed multicultural societies especially in large cities.</p><p>The states of the New World were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.</p><p>In recent decades feminist scholars (most notably Nira Yuval-Davis)[51] have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent.[52] It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviours that belong to a specific collectivity.[53] Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as Britannia or Marianne.</p><h2>Ethnicity and race[edit]</h2><p>Race and ethnicity are considered to be related concepts. Ethnicity is often assumed to be somewhat more of a cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language and cultural tradition, while race is assumed to be strictly a biological classification, based on DNA and bone structure. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to its common political use. It is assumed that, based on power relations, there exist 'racialized ethnicities' and 'ethnicized races'. Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.[54]</p><p>Before Weber, race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity was predominant: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.[55] With Weber's introduction of the view of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.</p><p>In 1950, the UNESCO statement, The Race Question, signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), suggested that: National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'.[56]</p><p>In 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:</p><p>The opposing interests that divide the working classes are further reinforced through appeals to racial and ethnic distinctions. Such appeals serve to allocate different categories of workers to rungs on the scale of labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations to the lower levels and insulating the higher echelons from competition from below. Capitalism did not create all the distinctions of ethnicity and race that function to set off categories of workers from one another. It is, nevertheless, the process of labor mobilization under capitalism that imparts to these distinctions their effective values.[57]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groupings during the period of capitalist expansion.[58]</p><p>Writing about the usage of the term ethnic in the ordinary language of Great Britain and the United States, in 1977 Wallman noted that</p><p>The term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' in Britain, only less precisely, and with a lighter value load. In North America, by contrast, '[race]' most commonly means color, and 'ethnics' are the descendants of relatively recent immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. '[Ethnic]' is not a noun in Britain. In effect there are no 'ethnics'; there are only 'ethnic relations'.[59]</p><p>In the U.S., the OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not scientific or anthropological and takes into account social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry, using appropriate scientific methodologies that are not primarily biological or genetic in reference.[60]</p><h2>Ethno-national conflict[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Ethnic conflict</p><p>Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like Jürgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.</p><p>The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the 20th century Nazi Germany. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.</p><h2>Ethnic groups by continent[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ethnic groups in Africa</p><p>Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own language (or dialect of a language) and culture.</p><p>Many ethnic groups and nations of Africa qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society.

Some groups are primarily hunter-gatherers, some practice transhumance (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban.

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The term Danish Realm (Danish: Det Danske Rige[14][15]) refers to the relationship between Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland—three countries constituting the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>The legal nature of the Kingdom of Denmark is fundamentally one of a unitary sovereign state. The Faroe Islands and Greenland have been part of the Crown of Denmark since 1397 (de jure) when the Kalmar Union was ratified, and part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1814 (de facto). However, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm now have an extensive type of self-government and have assumed legislative and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields.[16]</p><p>Legal matters in The Danish Realm are subject to the Danish Constitution.[17] Beginning in 1953, state law issues within The Danish Realm has been governed by The Unity of the Realm (Danish: Rigsenheden).[18][19][20][21] A less formal name for The Unity of the Realm is the Commonwealth of the Realm.[13] In 1978, The Unity of The Realm was for the first time unofficially referred to as rigsfællesskabet. The name caught on and since the 1990s, both The Unity of The Realm and The Danish Realm itself has increasingly been referred to as simply rigsfællesskabet (Faroese: ríkisfelagsskapurin; Greenlandic: naalagaaffeqatigiit) in daily parlance.[18]</p><p>The Danish Constitution stipulates that the foreign and security interests for all parts of the Danish Realm are the responsibility of the Danish government. The Faroes received home rule in 1948 and Greenland did so in 1979. In 2005, the Faroes received a self-government arrangement, and in 2009 Greenland received self rule, thus leaving the Danish government with virtually no influence over Greenlandic internal affairs.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Constitutionality[edit]</h2><p>The Danish Realm's unique state of internal affairs is acted out in the principle of The Unity of the Realm.[19] This principle is derived from Article 1 of the Danish Constitution which specifies that constitutional law applies equally to all areas of the Danish Realm.[22] The Constitutional Act specifies that sovereignty is to continue to be exclusively with the authorities of the Realm (the Danish government and parliament). Faroese or Greenlandic self-governance cannot be established by international treaties but must be established by Danish law; the Danish parliament (the Folketing) delegates a precisely defined part of its competence to the home rule authorities.[23]</p><p>The language of Denmark is Danish, and the Danish state authorities are based in Denmark. The Kingdom of Denmark's parliament, with its 179 members, is located in the capital, Copenhagen. Two of the parliament's members are elected in each of Greenland and the Faroe Islands; the remaining 175 members are elected in Denmark. The Government ministries are located in Copenhagen, as is the highest court, the Supreme Court.[22]</p><h2>Devolved powers[edit]</h2><p>See also: Home rule, Politics of the Faroe Islands, and Politics of Greenland</p><p>In principle, the Danish Realm constitutes a unified sovereign state, with equal status between its constituent parts.[13] Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains de jure unitary.</p><p>The Self-Government Arrangements devolves political competence and responsibility from the Danish political authorities to the Faroese and the Greenlandic political authorities. The Faroese and Greenlandic authorities administer the tasks taken over from the state, enact legislation in these specific fields and have the economic responsibility for solving these tasks. The Danish government provides an annual grant to the Faroese and the Greenlandic authorities to cover the costs of these devolved areas.[16]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Tinganes.jpg/220px-Tinganes.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Tinganes, in the capital Tórshavn, is the location of the Faroese Home Government.</p><p>The 1948 Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands sets out the terms of Faroese home rule. The Act states, ...the Faroe Islands shall constitute a self-governing community within the State of Denmark.[1] It establishes the home government of the Faroe Islands (Landsstýrið) and the Faroese parliament, the Løgting. More significantly, the Act specifies the powers devolved from the Government of Denmark, including: local government and municipal affairs; taxation, at a local and territorial level; public services, including police and town planning; welfare services, such as housing; primary and secondary education; Archives, libraries, museums; agriculture and fishing; entertainment; among other areas.[1] The Faroe Islands were previously administered as a Danish county (amt); the Home Rule Act abolished the post of Amtmand (County Governor) and replaced it with the role of Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner to the Danish government).[1] These powers were expanded in a 2005 Act, which named the Faroese home government as an equal partner with the Danish government.[24]</p><p>The 1978 Greenland Home Rule Act devolves powers in much the same way as the Faroese Home Rule Act. It sets out a home rule government and Greenlandic parliament. Specific areas of governance specified in the act include: Organization of local government; Fishing and agriculture; Welfare system; protection of the environment; other areas affecting Greenlanders directly, etc.[2]</p><p>On 21 June 2009, Greenland assumed self-determination with responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, natural resources, immigration and border controls. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[25] Greenland is now described as having self rule, with its home government exercising a wider range of powers.</p><p>There are a number of matters that can not be acquired by the territories; Constitutional affairs, foreign policy, defence, the Supreme Court, citizenship, and monetary policy. Additionally, the Faroese and Greenlandic parliaments are subordinate to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Denmark, where the two territories are represented by two seats each (from a total of 179 seats).</p><h2>Legal status[edit]</h2><p>The Faroe Islands and Greenland have two seats each (out of 179) in the Danish parliament, Folketinget[26] The arrangement between the areas of the Realm is sometimes described as constituent countries. Greenland's powers of self-government were increased in 2009 through the Greenland Self-Rule Act, which established the Greenlanders as a separate national people under international law, while the Faroe Islands have gradually taken control of more and more areas according to their Home Rule Act from 1948.[27] The Faroese/Danish act of 2005 states This law is based on an agreement between the Governments of the Faroe Islands and Denmark as equal partners.[28] Despite this principle of unity among the three territories, some commentators consider the Danish Realm as a federation or a sui generis legal construction. In the opinion of Bogi Eliasen, the Kingdom of Denmark is not a unitary state but a structure with some federative elements of divided power.[13] Danish justice Frederik Harhoff states that the Kingdom of Denmark is neither a federation (since it lacks a treaty to this effect), nor is it a confederation[13] But the home rules are limited to internal matters only. Greenland or the Faroe Islands cannot write laws which concern the relationship with other states, nor laws that applies to the entire Realm, and the Supreme Court (Danish: Højesteret) in Copenhagen is the final legal instance (and legal matters from Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be prepared for that court, like any Danish matter). Danish currency is also legal tender and Denmark is responsible for the military defense.[29] Further, for rare treatments and certain surgery, Greenlanders and Faraoses are often directed to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>International community[edit]</h3><p>See also: Foreign relations of Denmark</p><p>Previously, most foreign relations were undertaken by the Government of Denmark exclusively on behalf of the entire realm, but more recently the Faroe Islands and Greenland have increased their role in the foreign policy. Representatives for both have joined Danish delegations in discussions on some international matters, such as fishing rights. Greenlandic representatives were included in the process of a new treaty between Denmark and the US regarding the Thule Air Base in northwest Greenland.</p><p>The Kingdom of Denmark as a whole is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the OECD and the World Trade Organization. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are associated members of the Nordic Council in their own right as part of the wider membership of the Kingdom. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is a member of the European Union, both areas have special dispensation and remain outside the EU. Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark in 1973, but opted to leave in 1985 after Greenlandic home rule was introduced in 1979.</p><p>The Home Rule Act of the Faroe Islands specifies that a 'Faroese' shall be understood to mean a person who is a national of Denmark and a resident of the Faroe Islands.[1] The Government of Denmark issues special passports for its citizens living in the Faroe Islands and Greenland with the right to choose a regular Danish passport as well. The Faroese Home Rule Act states that, in Faroese passports, Føroyingur (Faroese) and Føroyar (Faroe Islands) shall be inserted after the words Dansk (Danish) and Danmark (Denmark).[1]</p><h2>Population and area[edit]</h2><p>Further information: Geography of Denmark, Geography of Greenland, and Geography of the Faroe Islands</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg/300px-Kingdom_of_Denmark%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_-_colored_%28zoom%29.svg.png" width="300" height="213"><br><p>Comparison map: Greenland, the Faroe Islands (enlarged) and Denmark differ significantly in size. The Danish Realm is spread far apart, across the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea.</p><p>The size of the Danish population is far greater than the population size of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper has a population of about 5.6 million people, while the populations of the Faroe Islands and Greenland are 48,000 and 56,000 people, respectively. A medium-sized Danish provincial town has, for comparison, a population of about 50,000. With an area of over two million km² (836,109 square miles), Greenland is the most sparsely populated territory in the world.</p><p>The disparity between the small population of the former colonies and the greater population of Denmark proper has helped to enforce the hegemonial position that Denmark proper holds in the Realm. When the areas of the three territories are combined, the Kingdom of Denmark ranks as the twelfth largest country in the world, the same rank held by Greenland alone.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Terminology[edit]</h2><p>Hjemmestyre
Meaning "home rule", it indicates an autonomous administration (present in both in Greenland and the Faroe Islands) that has power over all internal affairs. In this arrangement, the Danish government deals only with external matters such as defence and foreign affairs. Greenland and the Faroe Islands maintain their own elected assemblies and administrations, headed by a premier who appoints a cabinet. This is synonymous with "self-governing."


Selvstyre
Following a referendum on 25 November 2008 (the 30th anniversary of the establishment of home rule in Greenland), the relationship between the Danish and Greenlandic governments changed, with Greenland gaining greater autonomy. Further powers were granted to the Greenlandic government on 21 June 2009, including control of the police force, coastguard, and courts. Additionally, Greenland now receives fewer Danish subsidies, becoming more self-sufficient.[32] As a result of these changes Greenland was now said to have self rule with minimal support from Denmark, as opposed to "home rule".


Rigsombudsmand
High Commissioners represent the interests of Denmark in the Faroe Islands and Greenland. There is one Danish High Commissioner in each country. He or she can attend the meetings at the Løgting in the Faroes and at the Inatsisartut in Greenland, but they can't vote.


Folketingsmedlemmer fra Færøerne og Grønland
Members of Folketing from the Faroe Islands and Greenland: Greenland and the Faroe Islands and their self-rule administrations take part in consultations on policies and decisions affecting their region, including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the Danish parliament (Folketing). They have two members each, and these are full members of the Danish Folketing and are allowed to vote.


Countries
Mirroring the terminology of the United Kingdom or the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Greenland, Denmark and the Faroes are sometimes referred to as countries within the sovereign state of the Kingdom of Denmark. However, such usage is inconsistent; whilst Denmark proper may be referred to as a country, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are officially referred to as "self-governing territories".[33] Additionally, the recent law granting Greenland "self rule" in 2008 refers to Greenland as "a people", but not a country.[34]</p><h2>Literature[edit]</h2><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><h2>Sources[edit]</h2><p>Find more aboutKingdom of Denmarkat Wikipedia's sister projects

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>A constitutional monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution.[1] Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.</p><p>A constitutional monarchy may refer to a system in which the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state under the constitution, whether written or unwritten.[2] While most monarchs may hold formal authority and the government may legally operate in the monarch's name, in the form typical in Europe the monarch no longer personally sets public policy or chooses political leaders. Political scientist Vernon Bogdanor, paraphrasing Thomas Macaulay, has defined a constitutional monarch as a sovereign who reigns but does not rule.[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In addition to acting as a visible symbol of national unity, a constitutional monarch may hold formal powers such as dissolving parliament or giving royal assent to legislation. However, the exercise of such powers is largely strictly in accordance with either written constitutional principles or unwritten constitutional conventions, rather than any personal political preference imposed by the sovereign. In The English Constitution, British political theorist Walter Bagehot identified three main political rights which a constitutional monarch may freely exercise: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. Many constitutional monarchies still retain significant authorities or political influence however, such as through certain reserve powers, and may also play an important political role.</p><p>The United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms are all constitutional monarchies in the Westminster tradition of constitutional governance. Three states&nbsp;– Malaysia, Cambodia and the Holy See&nbsp;– are elective monarchies, wherein the ruler is periodically selected by a small electoral college.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The oldest constitutional monarchy dating back to ancient times was that of the Hittites. They were an ancient Anatolian people that lived during the Bronze Age whose king or queen had to share their authority with an assembly, called Panku, equivalent to a modern-day deliberative assembly of a legislature. These were scattered noble families that worked as representatives of their subjects in an adjutant or subaltern federal-type landscape.[4][5]</p><p>The most recent[update] country to move from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy was Bhutan, between 2007 and 2008 (see Politics of Bhutan, Constitution of Bhutan and Bhutanese democracy).</p><h2>Constitutional and absolute monarchy[edit]</h2><h3>England and the United Kingdom[edit]</h3><p>In the Kingdom of England, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 led to a constitutional monarchy restricted by laws such as the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, although limits on the power of the monarch ('a limited monarchy') are much older than that (see Magna Carta). At the same time, in Scotland the Convention of Estates enacted the Claim of Right Act 1689, which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy.</p><p>Although Queen Anne was the last monarch to veto an Act of Parliament when in 1707 she blocked the Scottish Militia Bill, Hanoverian monarchs continued to selectively dictate government policies. For instance George III constantly blocked Catholic Emancipation, eventually precipitating the resignation of William Pitt the Younger as Prime Minister in 1801.[6] The sovereign's influence on the choice of Prime Minister gradually declined over this period, William IV being the last monarch to dismiss a Prime Minister, when in 1834 he removed Lord Melbourne as a result of Melbourne's choice of Lord John Russell as Leader of the House of Commons.[7][8] Queen Victoria was the last monarch to exercise real personal power but this diminished over the course of her reign. In 1839 she became the last sovereign to keep a Prime Minister in power against the will of Parliament when the Bedchamber crisis resulted in the retention of Lord Melbourne's administration.[9] By the end of her reign, however, she could do nothing to block the unacceptable (to her) premierships of William Gladstone, although she still exercised power in appointments to the Cabinet, for example in 1886 preventing Gladstone's choice of Hugh Childers as War Secretary in favor of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.[10]</p><p>Today, the role of the British monarch is by convention effectively ceremonial.[11] Instead, the British Parliament and the Government – chiefly in the office of Prime Minister – exercise their powers under 'Royal (or Crown) Prerogative': on behalf of the monarch and through powers still formally possessed by the Monarch.[12][13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>No person may accept significant public office without swearing an oath of allegiance to the Queen.[14] With few exceptions, the monarch is bound by constitutional convention to act on the advice of the Government.</p><h3>Continental Europe[edit]</h3><p>Constitutional monarchy originated in continental Europe, with Poland developing the first constitution for a monarchy with the Constitution of May 3, 1791; it was the third constitution in the world just after the first republican Constitution of the United States. Constitutional monarchy also occurred briefly in the early years of the French Revolution, but much more widely afterwards. Napoleon Bonaparte is considered the first monarch proclaiming himself as an embodiment of the nation, rather than as a divinely-appointed ruler; this interpretation of monarchy is germane to continental constitutional monarchies. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, in his work Elements of the Philosophy of Right (1820), gave the concept a philosophical justification that concurred with evolving contemporary political theory and the Protestant Christian view of natural law.[15] Hegel's forecast of a constitutional monarch with very limited powers whose function is to embody the national character and provide constitutional continuity in times of emergency was reflected in the development of constitutional monarchies in Europe and Japan.[16]</p><h2>Modern constitutional monarchy[edit]</h2><p>As originally conceived, a constitutional monarch was head of the executive branch and quite a powerful figure even though his or her power was limited by the constitution and the elected parliament. Some of the framers of the US Constitution may have envisioned the president as an elected constitutional monarch, as the term was then understood, following Montesquieu's account of the separation of powers.[17]</p><p>The present-day concept of a constitutional monarchy developed in the United Kingdom, where the democratically elected parliaments, and their leader, the prime minister, exercise power, with the monarchs having ceded power and remaining as a titular position. In many cases the monarchs, while still at the very top of the political and social hierarchy, were given the status of servants of the people to reflect the new, egalitarian position. In the course of France's July Monarchy, Louis-Philippe I was styled King of the French rather than King of France.</p><p>Following the Unification of Germany, Otto von Bismarck rejected the British model. In the constitutional monarchy established under the Constitution of the German Empire which Bismarck inspired, the Kaiser retained considerable actual executive power, while the Imperial Chancellor needed no parliamentary vote of confidence and ruled solely by the imperial mandate. However this model of constitutional monarchy was discredited and abolished following Germany's defeat in the First World War. Later, Fascist Italy could also be considered as a constitutional monarchy, in that there was a king as the titular head of state while actual power was held by Benito Mussolini under a constitution. This eventually discredited the Italian monarchy and led to its abolition in 1946. After the Second World War, surviving European monarchies almost invariably adopted some variant of the constitutional monarchy model originally developed in Britain.</p><p>Nowadays a parliamentary democracy that is a constitutional monarchy is considered to differ from one that is a republic only in detail rather than in substance. In both cases, the titular head of state—monarch or president—serves the traditional role of embodying and representing the nation, while the government is carried on by a cabinet composed predominantly of elected Members of Parliament.</p><p>However, three important factors distinguish monarchies such as the United Kingdom from systems where greater power might otherwise rest with Parliament. These are: the Royal Prerogative under which the monarch may exercise power under certain very limited circumstances; Sovereign Immunity under which the monarch may do no wrong under the law because the responsible government is instead deemed accountable; and the monarch may not be subject to the same taxation or property use restrictions as most citizens. Other privileges may be nominal or ceremonial (e.g., where the executive, judiciary, police or armed forces act on the authority of or owe allegiance to the Crown).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today slightly more than a quarter of constitutional monarchies are Western European countries, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Luxembourg, Monaco, Liechtenstein and Sweden. However, the two most populous constitutional monarchies in the world are in Asia: Japan and Thailand. In these countries the prime minister holds the day-to-day powers of governance, while the monarch retains residual (but not always insignificant) powers. The powers of the monarch differ between countries. In Denmark and in Belgium, for example, the Monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of a coalition government following a parliamentary election, while in Norway the King chairs special meetings of the cabinet.</p><p>In nearly all cases, the monarch is still the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the Cabinet. Only a few monarchies (most notably Japan and Sweden) have amended their constitutions so that the monarch is no longer even the nominal chief executive.</p><p>There are sixteen constitutional monarchies under Queen Elizabeth II, which are known as Commonwealth realms.[18] Unlike some of their continental European counterparts, the Monarch and her Governors-General in the Commonwealth realms hold significant reserve or prerogative powers, to be wielded in times of extreme emergency or constitutional crises, usually to uphold parliamentary government. An instance of a Governor-General exercising such power occurred during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor-General. The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the necessary appropriation bills. On November 11, 1975, Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock. When he sought the Governor-General's approval of the election, the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister, and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition Malcolm Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies secured passage of the appropriation bills, and the Governor-General dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority. This led to much speculation among Whitlam's supporters as to whether this use of the Governor-General's reserve powers was appropriate, and whether Australia should become a republic. Among supporters of constitutional monarchy, however, the experience confirmed the value of the monarchy as a source of checks and balances against elected politicians who might seek powers in excess of those conferred by the constitution, and ultimately as a safeguard against dictatorship.</p><p>In Thailand's constitutional monarchy, the monarch is recognized as the Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, Upholder of the Buddhist Religion, and Defender of the Faith. The former King, Bhumibol Adulyadej, was the longest reigning monarch in the world and in all of Thailand's history, prior to passing away on 13 October 2016.[19] Bhumibol has reigned through several political changes in the Thai government. He has played an influential role in each incident, often acting as mediator between disputing political opponents. (See Bhumibol's role in Thai Politics.) Among the powers retained by the monarch under the constitution, lèse majesté protects the image of the monarch and enables him to play a role in politics. It carries strict criminal penalties for violators. Generally, the Thai people are reverent of Bhumibol. Much of his social influence arises from this reverence and from the socio-economic improvement efforts undertaken by the royal family.</p><p>In both the United Kingdom and elsewhere, a frequent debate centers on when it is appropriate for a monarch to use his or her political powers. When a monarch does act, political controversy can often ensue, partially because the neutrality of the crown is seen to be compromised in favor of a partisan goal, while some political scientists champion the idea of an interventionist monarch as a check against possible illegal action by politicians. For instance, the monarch of the United Kingdom can theoretically exercise an absolute veto over legislation by withholding royal assent. However, no monarch has done so since 1708, and it is widely believed that this and many of the monarch's other political powers are lapsed powers.</p><p>There are currently 44 monarchies, and most of them are constitutional monarchies.</p><h2>List of current constitutional monarchies[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div>

One of the animals found here is the polar bear, which is on the coat of arms of the Danish royal family in Greenland</p><p>The history of Greenland is a history of life under extreme Arctic conditions: currently, an ice cap covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.</p><p>The first humans are thought to have arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental North America. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when Icelandic Vikings settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the Inuit Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around 1200 AD, from northwestern Greenland. While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the Little Ice Age, the early Norse settlements along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, Denmark-Norway, apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a colonial power, Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to paganism. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.</p><p>During World War II, when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the United States and Canada.[1] After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas amt (county). Although Greenland is still a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it has enjoyed home rule since 1979. In 1985, the island decided to leave the European Union, which it had joined as a part of Denmark in 1973; the Faroes had never joined.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early Paleo-Eskimo cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png/200px-Arctic_cultures_900-1500.png" width="200" height="764"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Arctic cultures in and around Greenland, 900-1500</p><p>The prehistory of Greenland is a story of repeated waves of Paleo-Eskimo immigration from the islands north of the North American mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of Siberia who migrated into Canada thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. Archaeology can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.</p><p>The earliest known cultures in Greenland are the Saqqaq culture (2500–800 BC) [2] and the Independence I culture in northern Greenland (2400–1300 BCE). The practitioners of these two cultures are thought to have descended from separate groups that came to Greenland from northern Canada.[3] Around 800 BCE, the so-called Independence II culture arose in the region where the Independence I culture had previously existed.[4] it was originally thought that Independence II was succeeded by Dorset culture (700 BC–200 AD), but some Independence II artefacts date from as recently as the 1st century BCE. Recent studies suggest that, in Greenland at least, the Dorset culture may be better understood as a continuation of Independence II culture; the two cultures have therefore been designated Greenlandic Dorset. Artefacts associated with early Dorset culture in Greenland have been found as far north as Inglefield Land on the west coast and the Dove Bugt area on the east coast.[5]</p><p>After the Early Dorset culture disappeared around 200 AD, the island was uninhabited for several centuries.[5] The next immigrants to arrive from Canada, perhaps as early as 800, settled the northwest part of the island, bringing with them the so-called Late Dorset culture, which survived until about 1300.[6] The Norse arrived and settled in the southern part of the island in 980.</p><h2>Norse settlement[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg/220px-I._E._C._Rasmussen_-_Sommernat_under_den_Gr%C3%B8nlandske_Kyst_circa_Aar_1000.jpg" width="220" height="138"><br><p>Summer in the Greenland coast circa year 1000
Jens Erik Carl Rasmussen (1841–1893)</p><p>Europeans became aware of Greenland's existence, probably in the early 10th century, when Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, sailing from Norway to Iceland, was blown off course by a storm, and happened to sight some islands off Greenland. During the 980s, explorers led by Erik the Red set out from Iceland and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and settled there. Erik named the island Greenland (Grœnland in Old Norse, Grænland in modern Icelandic, Grønland in modern Danish and Norwegian) in effect as a marketing device. Both the Book of Icelanders (Íslendingabók, a medieval account of Icelandic history from the 12th century onward) and the Saga of Eric the Red (Eiríks saga rauða, a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland) state He named the land Greenland, saying that people would be eager to go there if it had a good name.[7]</p><p>The Norse established their settlements along fjords (such as the Tunuliarfik and Aniaaq fjords in the central area of the Eastern settlement). Because this was during the so-called Medieval Warm Period, the vegetation there was very different from what it is today. Excavations have shown that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4 to 6 metre tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush.[8][unreliable source?][9][unreliable source?] The Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for three years for committing murder.[10] He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.[11] This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at Brattahlid (now Qassiarsuk), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, Leif Eirikson, left the settlement to explore the regions around Vinland, which is generally assumed to have been located in what is now Newfoundland.</p><p>The Norse settled in three separate locations: the larger Eastern settlement, the smaller Western settlement, and the still smaller Middle Settlement (often considered part of the Eastern one). The settlements at their height are estimated to have had a population of between 2,000 and 10,000 people, with more recent estimates[12] tending toward the lower figure. Ruins of approximately 620 farms have been identified: 500 in the Eastern settlement, 95 in the Western settlement, and 20 in the Middle. The settlements carried on a trade in ivory from walrus tusks with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides according to one 13th-century account. They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal Labrador), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late 13th century, all ships from Greenland were required by law to sail directly to Norway. The climate also became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the Little Ice Age.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Hvalsey_Church.jpg/200px-Hvalsey_Church.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><p>Hvalsey Church</p><p>In 1126, a diocese was founded at Garðar (now Igaliku). It was subject to the Norwegian archdiocese of Nidaros (now Trondheim); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261, the population accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King as well, although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements declined in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350. In 1378, there was no longer a bishop at Garðar. The last written record of the Norse Greenlanders is of a marriage, in 1408, in Hvalsey Church, which still stands today; although in ruins, it is the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.</p><p>After 1408 not many written records mention the settlers. There is correspondence between the Pope and the Biskop Bertold af Garde from the same year.[13] The Danish Cartographer Claudius Clavus seems to have visited Greenland in 1420, according to documents written by Nicolas Germanus and Henricus Martellus who had access to original cartographic notes and a map by Clavus. Two mathematical manuscripts containing the second chart of the Claudius Clavus map from his journey to Greenland, where he himself mapped the area, were found during the late 20th century by the Danish scholar Bjönbo and Petersen.[14]</p><p>In a letter dated 1448 from Rome, Pope Nicholas V prescribed the bishops of Skálholt and Hólar (the two Icelandic episcopal sees) to ensure to provide the inhabitants of Greenland with priests and a bishop, the latter of which they hadn't had in the 30 years since the apparent coming of the heathens when most churches were destroyed and the people taken away as prisoners.[15]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the middle of the 15th century although no exact date has been established.</p><h2>Norse failure[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Grtemp.png" width="355" height="173"><p>A graphical description of changes in temperature in Greenland from 500&nbsp;– 1990 based on analysis of the deep ice core from Greenland and some historical events.

Among the factors that have been suggested as contributing to the demise of the Greenland colony are:[16][17]</p><p>Numerous studies have tested these hypotheses and some have led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.[citation needed] The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.[18]</p><p>Greenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation.[19] A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food.[19] But they never learned to use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.[19]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>To investigate the possibility of climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples. The oxygen isotopes from the ice caps suggested that the Medieval Warm Period had caused a relatively milder climate in Greenland, lasting from roughly 800 to 1200. However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, the Little Ice Age had reached intense levels in Greenland.[20] Excavations of middens from the Viking farms in both Greenland and Iceland show the shift from the bones of cows and pigs to those of sheep and goats. As the winters lengthened, and the springs and summers shortened, there must have been less and less time for Greenlanders to grow hay. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century—as much as 6-8&nbsp;°C lower than modern summer temperatures.[21] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. By the mid-14th century deposits from a chieftain’s farm showed a large number of cattle and caribou remains, whereas, a poorer farm only several kilometers away had no trace of domestic animal remains, only seal. Bone samples from Greenland Norse cemeteries confirm that the typical Greenlander diet had increased by this time from 20% sea animals to 80%.[22]</p><p>Although Greenland seems to have been uninhabited at the time of initial Norse settlement, the Thule people migrated south and finally came into contact with the Norse in the 12th century. There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as skræling. The Icelandic Annals are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.[23] Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference—an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them—or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.[citation needed]</p><p>The Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of kayak navigation or ring seal hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement. By 1350, the Norse had completely deserted their Western Settlement.[24] The Inuit, being a hunting society, may have hunted the Norse livestock, forcing the Norse into conflict or abandonment of their settlements.[citation needed]</p><p>In mild weather conditions, a ship could make the 900-mile (1400 kilometers) trip from Iceland to Eastern Settlement within a couple of weeks. Greenlanders had to keep in contact with Iceland and Norway in order to trade. Little is known about any distinctive shipbuilding techniques among the Greenlanders. Greenland lacks a supply of lumber, so was completely dependent on Icelandic merchants or, possibly, logging expeditions to the Canadian coast.[citation needed]</p><p>The sagas mention Icelanders traveling to Greenland to trade.[25] Settlement chieftains and large farm owners controlled this trade. Chieftains would trade with the foreign ships and then disperse the goods by trading with the surrounding farmers.[26] The Greenlanders' main commodity was the walrus tusk,[16] which was used primarily in Europe as a substitute for elephant ivory for art décor, whose trade had been blocked by conflict with the Islamic world. Professor Gudmundsson suggests a very valuable narwhal tusk trade, through a smuggling route between western Iceland and the Orkney islands.[citation needed]</p><p>It has been argued that the royal Norwegian monopoly on shipping contributed to the end of trade and contact. However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the Herjolfsnes church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding. Most had crucifixes around their necks with their arms crossed as in a stance of prayer. Roman papal records report that the Greenlanders were excused from paying their tithes in 1345 because the colony was suffering from poverty.[27] The last reported ship to reach Greenland was a private ship that was blown off course, reaching Greenland in 1406, and departing in 1410 with the last news of Greenland: the burning at the stake of a condemned witch, the insanity and death of the woman this witch was accused of attempting to seduce through witchcraft, and the marriage of the ship's captain, Thorsteinn Ólafsson, to another Icelander, Sigridur Björnsdóttir.[28] However, there are some suggestions of much later unreported voyages from Europe to Greenland, possibly as late as the 1480s.[29] In the mid-1500s, a German ship drifted off-course to Greenland and, coming ashore a small island, discovered the body of a dead man lying face down who demonstrated cultural traits of both Norse and Inuit. An Icelandic crew member of the ship wrote: He had a hood on his head, well sewn, and clothes from both homespun and sealskin. At his side lay a carving knife bent and worn down by whetting. This knife they took with them for display.[30]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to a 2009 study, there is no evidence for perceptible contact between Iceland and Greenland after the mid fifteenth century... It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years. Presumably, the archbishop had better archives at his disposal than most people, and yet he had not heard that the Greenlanders were gone.[18]</p><p>One intriguing fact is that very few fish remains are found among their middens. This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, and may have been disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied more and more of the diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.[31]</p><p>One Inuit story recorded in the 18th century tells that raiding expeditions by European ships over the course of three years destroyed the settlement, after which many of the Norse sailed away south and the Inuit took in some of the remaining women and children before the final attack.[11]</p><h2>Late Dorset and Thule cultures[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png/220px-ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png" width="220" height="286"><br><p>The Thule were skilled whalers, as depicted here by Norwegian missionary Hans Egede in the 18th century.</p><p>The Norse may not have been alone on the island when they arrived; a new influx of Arctic people from the west, the Late Dorset culture, may predate them.[6] However, this culture was limited to the extreme northwest of Greenland, far from the Norse who lived around the southern coasts. Some archaeological evidence may point to this culture slightly predating the Norse settlement. It disappeared around 1300, around the same time as the westernmost of the Norse settlements disappeared. In the region of this culture, there is archaeological evidence of gathering sites for around four to thirty families, living together for a short time during their movement cycle.</p><p>Around 1200, another Arctic culture, the Thule, arrived from the west, having emerged 200 years earlier in Alaska. They settled south of the Late Dorset culture and ranged over vast areas of Greenland's west and east coasts. These people, the ancestors of the modern Inuit, were flexible and engaged in the hunting of almost all animals on land and in the ocean, including big whales. They had dogs, which the Dorset did not, and used them to pull the dog sledges; they also used bows and arrows, contrary to the Dorset. Increasingly settled, they had large food storages to avoid winter famine. The early Thule avoided the highest latitudes, which only became populated again after renewed immigration from Canada in the 19th century.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The nature of the contacts between the Thule, Dorset and Norse cultures is not clear, but may have included trade elements. The level of contact is currently the subject of widespread debate, possibly including Norse trade with Thule or Dorsets in Canada or possible scavenging of abandoned Norse sites (see also Maine penny). No Norse trade goods are known in Dorset archaeological sites in Greenland; the only Norse items found have been characterized as exotic items. Carved screw threads on tools and carvings with beards found in settlements on the Canadian Arctic islands show contact with the Norse. Some stories tell of armed conflicts between, and kidnappings by, both Inuit and Norse groups. The Inuit may have reduced Norse food sources by displacing them on hunting grounds along the central west coast. These conflicts can be one contributing factor to the disappearance of the Norse culture as well as for the Late Dorset, but few see it as the main reason.</p><h2>Danish recolonization[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish colonization of Greenland</p><p>Most of the old Norse records concerning Greenland were removed from Trondheim to Copenhagen in 1664 and subsequently lost, probably in the 1728 fire there.[32] The precise rediscovery is uncertain because south-drifting icebergs during the Little Ice Age long made the eastern coast unreachable, leading to general confusion between Baffin Island, Greenland, and Spitsbergen as seen, for example, in the difficulty locating the Frobisher Strait, which was not confirmed to be a bay until 1861. Nonetheless, interest in discovering a Northwest Passage to Asia led to repeated expeditions in the area, though none were successful until Roald Amundsen in 1906 and even that success involved his being iced in for two years. Christian I of Denmark purportedly sent an expedition to the region under Pothorst and Pining to Greenland in 1472 or 1473; Henry VII of England sent another under Cabot in 1497 and 1498; Manuel I of Portugal sent a third under Corte-Real in 1500 and 1501. It had certainly been generally charted by the 1502 Cantino map, which includes the southern coastline.[32] The island was rediscovered yet again by Martin Frobisher in 1578, prompting the Danish king Frederick II to outfit a new expedition of his own the next year under the Englishman James Alday; this proved a costly failure.[32] The influence of English and Dutch whalers became so pronounced that for a time the western shore of the island itself became known as Davis Strait (Dutch: Straat Davis) after John Davis's 1585 and 1586 expeditions, which charted the western coast as far north as Disko Bay.[33]</p><p>Meanwhile, following Sweden's exit from the Kalmar Union, the remaining states in the personal union were reorganized into Denmark-Norway in 1536. In protest against foreign involvement in the region, the Greenlandic polar bear was included in the state's coat of arms in the 1660s (It was removed in 1958). In the second half of the 17th century Dutch, German, French, Basque, and Dano-Norwegian ships hunted bowhead whales in the pack ice off the east coast of Greenland, regularly coming to shore to trade and replenish drinking water. Foreign trade was later forbidden by Danish monopoly merchants.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Old_Greenland_1747.jpg/220px-Old_Greenland_1747.jpg" width="220" height="140"><br><p>A 1747 map based on Egede's descriptions, including many geographical errors common to the time.</p><p>From 1711 to 1721,[34] the Norwegian cleric Hans Egede petitioned King Frederick IV for funding to travel to Greenland and re-establish contact with the Norse settlers there. Presumably, such settlers would still be Catholic or even pagan and he desired to establish a mission among them to spread the Reformation.[35] Frederick permitted Egede and some Norwegian merchants to establish the Bergen Greenland Company to revive trade with the island but refused to grant them a monopoly over it for fear of antagonizing Dutch whalers in the area.[36] The Royal Mission College assumed superintendency over the mission and provided the company with a small stipend. Egede found but misidentified the ruins of the Norse colony, went bankrupt amid repeated attacks by the Dutch, and found lasting conversion of the migrant Inuit exceedingly difficult. An attempt to found a royal colony under Major Claus Paarss established the settlement of Godthåb (Good Hope) in 1728 but was a costly debacle which saw most of his soldiers mutiny[35] and his settlers killed by scurvy.[37] Two child converts sent to Copenhagen for the coronation of Christian VI returned in 1733 with smallpox, devastating the island. The same ship that returned them, however, also brought the first Moravian missionaries, who in time would convert a former angekok (Inuit shaman), experience a revival at their mission of New Herrnhut, and establish a string of mission houses along the southwest coast. Around the same time, the merchant Jacob Severin took over administration of the colony and its trade and, having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son Poul. Both of them had studied the Kalaallisut language extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College such as Otto Fabricius began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.[34]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden at the 1814 Treaty of Kiel. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like William Scoresby and Greenland-born Knud Rasmussen. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first Greenlandic-language journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.[38] During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from British North America to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the Northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 Lakagígar eruption in Iceland.</p><p>Democratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862–1863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by Fridtjof Nansen accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64°N latitude.[39] In 1911, two Landstings were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in Copenhagen, where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the status quo, as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.</p><p>By 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially Hans Egede (1686 – 1758), a Lutheran missionary called the Apostle of Greenland. He founded Greenland's capital Godthåb, now known as Nuuk. His grandson Hans Egede Saabye (1746 – 1817) continued the missionary activities.[40]</p><h2>Polar exploration[edit]</h2><p>At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including Robert Peary, explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.</p><h2>Strategic importance[edit]</h2><p>See also: History of Greenland during World War II</p><p>After Norway regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian whaler Hallvard Devold occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as Erik the Red's Land. Two years later, the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled in favor of Denmark.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/ThuleAirBase.jpg/220px-ThuleAirBase.jpg" width="220" height="70"><br><p>The Thule Air Base, established after World War II, is the northernmost base of the US Air Force</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>World War II[edit]</h3><p>During World War II, when Nazi Germany extended its war operations to Greenland, Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish Minister to the United States&nbsp;— who had already refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark&nbsp;— signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting the US Armed Forces permission to establish stations in Greenland.[41] Kauffmann did this without the knowledge of the Danish government, and consequently, the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately – none of which had any result.[41] Because of the difficulties for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful export, especially of cryolite, Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status. Its supplies were guaranteed by the United States and Canada.</p><p>One Dane was killed in combat with Germans in Greenland.[41]</p><h3>Cold War[edit]</h3><p>During the Cold War, Greenland had a strategic importance, controlling parts of the passage between the Soviet Arctic harbours and the Atlantic, as well as being a good base for observing any use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, typically planned to pass over the Arctic. The United States therefore had a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100,000,000 but Denmark did not agree to sell.[42][43] In 1951, the Kauffman treaty was replaced by another one. The Thule Air Base at Thule (now Qaanaaq) in the northwest was made a permanent air force base. In 1953, some Inuit families were forced by Denmark to move from their homes to provide space for extension of the base. For this reason, the base has been a source of friction between the Danish government and the Greenlandic people. Tensions mounted when, on January 21, 1968, there was a nuclear accident&nbsp;— a B-52 Stratofortress carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed near the base, contaminating the area with radioactive debris. Although most of the contaminated ice was cleaned up, controversy currently surrounds recently declassified information indicating that one of the bombs was not accounted for. A 1995 Danish parliamentary scandal, dubbed Thulegate, highlighted that nuclear weapons were routinely present in Greenland's airspace in the years leading up to the accident, and that Denmark had tacitly given the go-ahead for this activity despite its official nuclear free policy.</p><p>Another recent controversy surrounds the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), which the United States Air Force upgraded in recent years to a phased array radar.[44] Opponents argue that the system presents a threat to the local population, as it would be targeted in the event of nuclear war.</p><h2>Home rule[edit]</h2><p>See also: Greenlandic independence</p><p>From 1948 to 1950, the Greenland Commission studied the conditions on the island, seeking to address its isolation, unequal laws, and economic stagnation. In the end, the Royal Greenland Trading Department's monopolies were finally removed. In 1953, Greenland was raised from the status of colony to that of an autonomous province or constituent country of the Danish Realm. Greenland was also assigned its own Danish county. Despite its small population, it was provided nominal representation in the Danish Folketing.</p><p>A plantation of exotic arctic trees was created in 1954 near Narsarsuaq.[45]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg/222px-Greenland_flag_on_building.jpg" width="222" height="148"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Blok P, the largest building in Greenland and formerly home to about 1% of its population, was demolished on October 19, 2012.</p><p>Denmark also began a number of reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their dependence on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.[46] Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.</p><p>Greenland's minimal representation in the Folketing meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The Folketing approved devolution in 1978 and the next year enacted home rule under a local Landsting. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985.</p><p>Greenland Home Rule has become increasingly Greenlandized, rejecting Danish and avoiding regional dialects to standardize the country under the language and culture of the Kalaallit (West Greenland Inuit). The capital Godthåb was renamed Nuuk in 1979; a local flag was adopted in 1985; the Danish KGH became the locally administered Kalaallit Niuerfiat (now KNI A/S) in 1986. Following a successful referendum on self-government in 2008, the local parliament's powers were expanded and Danish was removed as an official language in 2009.</p><p>International relations are now largely, but not entirely, also left to the discretion of the home rule government. After leaving the EEC, Greenland signed a special treaty with it,[when?] granting it special access to the market as a constituent country of Denmark, which remains a member. Greenland is also a member of several small organizations[which?] along with Iceland, the Faroes, and the Inuit populations of Canada and Russia.[citation needed] It was one of the founders of the environmental Arctic Council in 1996. The US military bases on the island remain a major issue, with some politicians pushing for renegotiation of the 1951 US–Denmark treaty by the Home Rule government. The 1999–2003 Commission on Self-Governance even proposed that Greenland should aim at Thule Air Base's removal from American authority and operation under the aegis of the United Nations.[47]</p><h2>Notes[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

								&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Amt (administrative division))
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Amt is a type of administrative division governing a group of municipalities, today only in Germany, but formerly also common in other countries of Northern Europe.[1] Its size and functions differ by country and the term is roughly equivalent to a US township or county or English shire district.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Current usage[edit]</h2><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>Prevalence[edit]</p><p>The Amt (plural: Ämter) is unique to the German Bundesländer (federal states) of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.</p><p>Other German states had this subdivision in the past. Some states have similar administrative units called Samtgemeinde (Lower Saxony), Verbandsgemeinde (Rhineland-Palatinate) or Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia).</p><p>Definition[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An Amt, as well as the other above-mentioned units, is subordinate to a Kreis (district) and is a collection of municipalities. The amt is lower than district-level government but higher than municipal government, and may be described as a supra-municipality or municipal confederation. Normally, it consists of very small municipalities (Gemeinden, plural of Gemeinde).</p><p>Larger municipalities do not belong to an Amt and are called amtsfreie Gemeinden (independent municipalities); some of these municipalities may also not depend from a Kreis (district) and are called kreisfreie Gemeinden, and when they do also not belong to any other Land they are also called Stadtstaaten (plural of Stadtstaat), i.e. city-states (Berlin and Hamburg).</p><p>These large municipalities (cities, in German Städte, plural of Stadt) may be further subdivided into local offices named Ortsämter (plural of Ortsamt), each of them possibly grouping several suburbs (or small townships in rural areas) of the municipality named Ortsteile (plural of Ortsteil), named from small villages or hamlets or localities. The Ortsteil (suburb or township) may have been a former parish, but today it is meant only for civil purpose and essentially used for planning within the municipality; the Ortsamt (sometimes just named informally but confusingly as an Amt, or informally translated as an urban district) is used to offer decentralized services of the municipality within local administrative offices for the residents in neighbouring suburbs. The Ortsteil itself may also be confusingly translated as a municipality, but it is incorrect because it belongs to a city which is the only effective municipality (Gemeinde).</p><h2>Former usage[edit]</h2><h3>Denmark[edit]</h3><p>The amt (plural, amter; commonly translated as county) was an administrative unit of Denmark (and, historically, of Denmark-Norway). The counties were established by royal decree in 1662 as replacements for the former Len (fiefs). The amter were originally composed of independent towns (købstæder) and parishes, and held only small areas of responsibility. During the 20th century, they were granted responsibility for the hospital service for the non-urban population. A 1970 administrative reform reduced the number of counties to fourteen and eliminated the administrative distinction between (rural) parish and town. From then on, the amter were composed of a number of municipalities (kommuner). The reform granted the counties wider areas of responsibility, most notably running the national health service and the gymnasium secondary schools.</p><p>The Danish Municipal Reform of January 1, 2007 abolished the amter and replaced them with five administrative regions, now solely charged with running the national health service. In contrast to the amter the regions hold no authority to levy taxes. The reform re-delegated all other areas of responsibility to either the municipalities or the state. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98. See Counties of Denmark for more information about the Danish usage of the term.</p><h3>Germany[edit]</h3><p>In Germany an Amt was a medieval administrative district covering a manorial estate or the land owned by a castle or village. It was headed by an Amtmann, usually a lesser nobleman or cleric, appointed by a territorial lord to administer and dispense justice within the Amt.</p><h3>Netherlands and Flanders[edit]</h3><p>Ambacht can be seen as the Dutch equivalent to amt. Ambachten existed in Holland, Zeeland and Flanders up to about 1800.</p><h3>Iceland[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>While Iceland was a territory of the Danish realm, amts (singular: amt; plural: ömt) were established in the country on top of the existing counties. From 1684 to 1770, Iceland as whole was a single amt in the Kingdom of Denmark but was then split into two amts: North and East Amt (Norður- og Austuramt) and South and West Amt (Suður- og Vesturamt). The latter was in 1787 split into a West Amt (Vesturamt) and South Amt (Suðuramt). Iceland was thus divided into three amts until 1872, when the South and West amts were again merged. Amts were abolished in 1904, when Iceland gained home rule from Denmark.</p><p>Amts are not used to denote a geographical region in Iceland but the name lives on in the names of two public libraries in Iceland that were established during the amt era. The Amts libraries in Akureyri and Stykkishólmur which were established as the designated archives for the North and East Amt and the West Amt respectively.</p><h3>Norway[edit]</h3><p>From 1662 to 1919, the counties of Norway were called amter. They are now referred to as fylker, a term revived from the Middle Ages.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

There are no archbishops; the most senior bishop (primus inter pares) is the Bishop of Copenhagen, currently Peter Skov-Jakobsen. The further subdivision includes 111 deaneries and 2,200 parishes. There are about 2,400 vicars.[citation needed]</p><h3>Parishes[edit]</h3><p>Each parish has a parochial council, elected by church members in four-year terms. The parochial council leads the practical business of the local church and decides employment of personnel, including the vicar(s). The vicar is subordinate to the council, except in spiritual matters such as conducting church services and pastoral care. Both parochial councils and vicars are, however, subordinate to bishops.</p><p>Voluntary congregations[edit]</p><p>A special feature is the possibility of creating voluntary congregations (valgmenighed) within the Church. These account for a few percent of church members. They are voluntary associations, electing their own parochial council and vicar, whom they agree to pay from their own pockets. In return, they are exempt from church tax. The voluntary congregation and its vicar are subordinate to bishops, and members remain full members of the Church. Historically, when a parish was dominated by a conservative majority and rector, the liberal minority would often set up a voluntary congregation with their own rector - and vice versa. Today the voluntary congregations are often a solution for people who find the idea of a free church appealing, but wish to keep some bonds to the church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Parish optionality[edit]</p><p>Another, less commonly used feature is parish optionality (sognebåndsløsning, literally parish bond release). If a Church member is dissatisfied with the particular vicar of his residence parish, he may choose to be served by another vicar who matches better with his Christian views, for example in a neighbouring parish.</p><h3>Membership[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Religion in Denmark</p><p>According to official statistics from January 2017, 75.9% of Danes are members of the Church of Denmark.[5] Membership rates vary from 58.1% in the Diocese of Copenhagen to 85.2% in the Diocese of Viborg. In recent years, the percentage of Danes that are members of the church has been slowly declining, the most important reasons being immigration from non-Lutheran countries, withdrawal of some members, and a somewhat lower rate (61.5%) of Danish infants being christened.[9]</p><p>Any person who is baptised (usually infant baptism) into the Church of Denmark automatically becomes a member. Members may renounce their membership and later return if they wish. Excommunication is legally possible but an extraordinarily rare occurrence. Examples include declared Satanists. A church member supporting reincarnation was excommunicated, but the Supreme Court overturned the excommunication in 2005.</p><h3>Faith and church attendance[edit]</h3><p>According to the latest inquiry about 2.4% [10] of church members attend services every week, although on Christmas Eve more than a third of the population attend. However, the church is still widely used for traditional family ceremonies including christenings and confirmations. In the year 2015, 33.8% of weddings[11][2] and 83.7% funerals were performed in the Church of Denmark,[12] and 71% of adolescents in grade 7–8 were confirmed.[13] The level of weekly church attendance is similar to that in Norway and Sweden.</p><p>According to a 2009 poll, 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the Son of God, and 18% believe he is the saviour of the world.[14]</p><h2>Doctrine[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG/220px-Alter_og_d%C3%B8befont_i_Besser_Kirke_%28Sams%C3%B8_Kommune%29.JPG" width="220" height="331"><br><p>Communion table and baptismal font in Besser Church, Samsø</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The church is aimed at having a wide acceptance of theological views, as long as they agree with the official symbolic books as stipulated in the Danish Code of 1683. These are:</p><p>Revised versions of the Old and New Testament were authorised by the Queen in 1992. A revised Hymn Book was authorised in 2003. Both the Bible translations and the Hymn Book implied widespread public and theological debate.</p><p>Historically, there is a contrast between a liberal current inspired by N. F. S. Grundtvig and more strict, pietist or Bible fundamentalist movements (such as Indre Mission). These tensions have sometimes threatened to divide the Church. Tidehverv is a minor fraction based on a strict Lutheranism and anti-modern, national-conservative views.[15][16]</p><p>The Church of Denmark is member of the Porvoo Communion between Lutheran and Anglican Churches.</p><h3>Liturgy[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Konfirmander.jpg/220px-Konfirmander.jpg" width="220" height="308"><br><p>Children preparing to be confirmed and become members of the church</p><p>The Communion Service includes three readings from the Bible: a chapter from one of the Gospels, from one of the Epistles or another part of the New Testament and, since 1992, from the Old Testament. Texts are picked from an official list following the church year. Some liturgical features have a fixed content but are free to the form. This accounts for the Common Prayer following the sermon, where the priest is obliged to mention the royal house. Some will simply mention the Queen and all her House whereas others will list all members of the royal house by name and title.</p><p>The sermon, as in other Protestant churches, is a central part of the service. The priest takes a starting point in the text of that Sunday, but is free to form a personal message of it. At special occasions, even non-priests may be allowed to preach. Hymns are also very central. In contrast to Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, Danish congregations sit while singing and stand while listening to Bible readings.</p><p>As in other Lutheran churches, the Church of Denmark recognizes only two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. These are usually included in the Communion Service. Formerly, individual or shared confession was a condition to receive the Lord's Supper. An official confession ritual still exists, but is now used very rarely. There are also official rituals for confirmation, wedding, blessing of a civil wedding and funerals. Emergency baptism may be performed by any Christian if necessary, and later the child will then be produced in Church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Church and state[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg/220px-Vor_Frue_Kirke_Copenhagen.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>The Church of Our Lady, the cathedral of Copenhagen and the National Cathedral of Denmark</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg/220px-RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg" width="220" height="305"><br><p>Roskilde Cathedral has been the burial place of Danish royalty since the 15th century.

This applies to the royal princes and princesses as well, but does not apply to their spouses. Traditionally, though, every foreigner who has become a member of the royal family has converted or become a member of the church; as a result, the Prince Consort Henrik converted from Catholicism before marrying the Queen in 1968, and Mary Donaldson also converted from Presbyterianism before marrying Crown Prince Frederik in 2004.</p><h3>Freedom of religion[edit]</h3><p>With the Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Lutheran Christianity was established as the state religion. For the next century, in a time when religious wars swept Europe, harsh persecution of other faiths followed (Lutheran orthodoxy). Exceptions were granted only to foreign diplomats. For at least a period in the 16th century, small circles of clandestine Catholicism prevailed. From 1683, Roman Catholic, Reformed and Jewish congregations were allowed in the new town of Fredericia, the latter two also in Copenhagen. Non-Lutherans were also allowed in Friedrichstadt and on Nordstrand in Slesvig and in Glückstadt in Holstein. With the constitution of 1849, freedom of religion was introduced in Denmark, but Lutheranism remained the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Recognised and approved religions[edit]</p><p>A religious community does not need any state approval in order to enjoy the freedom of religion granted by the constitution. However, state-approved congregations (godkendte trossamfund) enjoy several privileges. They may conduct legal weddings, establish own cemeteries, get residence permits for foreign priests, are exempt from corporate and property tax, may apply for means from the state lottery fund, and members may tax-deduct membership fees and presents to the congregation.</p><p>Additionally, those congregations recognised by royal decree before 1970 (anerkendte trossamfund) may name and baptize children with legal effect, keep their own church registers and transcribe certificates on the basis of such registers.[6]</p><p>This legal distinction between recognised and approved communities remains, but is mainly a historical one. Communities recognised before 1970 includes only eight well-established Christian communities as well as one Jewish community. From 1970 until the 1990s only a few more Christian congregations were approved, but since 1998, a much more liberal practice has ensued. Since then, a board of independent experts decide about approval of new religious communities. The board includes professors of law, religious studies and theology and works under the Ministry of Justice, deliberately separate from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical affairs. It merely investigates whether the organisation fulfills basic definitions, such as having a doctrine, creed and cult, in order to be called a congregation of faith. In 2003, the approval of the Forn Sed religion caused some public debate.</p><h3>Lack of central authority[edit]</h3><p>The Church is in practice barred from having official positions in political or other matters, since it has no central bodies that could define such stances: nor a spiritual leader (such as an archbishop), nor a central assembly or synod. Bishops have the last say on doctrinal questions within their respective dioceses. The Queen (in practice the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Parliament are the central bodies, but they usually keep to administrative matters and abstain from interfering with spiritual questions. Church laws are rarely changed, and, when it happens, only administrative matters are affected.</p><p>Firstly, these principles are generally believed to ensure a non-sectarian, tolerant church where parishioners and priests enjoy a high degree of freedom to practise their own interpretation of Lutheran Christianity. Secondly, many Danish politicians and theologians claim that only this church-state-model will ensure the division of politics and religion, since the Church cannot interfere with political matters or even claim to speak with one voice on behalf of its members. They frequently discourage the term state church and argue it is, as its name states, the people's church.</p><p>Article 66 of the Danish Constitution stipulates a church ordinance shall be laid down by law. This promissory clause dates back from the first Constitution of 1849 but was never put into practice. It was feared that splits could occur if a central authority were created.</p><p>In very few cases have politicians deviated from their traditional hands-off course in church doctrinal matters. Where they have done so, it has been with the declared aim of preventing a possible split in the church. See the issues of Female clergy and Same-sex marriage above.</p><h3>Civil registration[edit]</h3><p>The Church of Denmark conducts civil registration of births, deaths, change of name etc. (vital records). The keeping of such kirkebøger (church books) is a centuries-long tradition, dating from when the parish rectors were the only government representatives in rural areas. In 2002-03 the traditional church records were replaced by a new national electronic registration system called Personregistrering. After protests in 2005, the Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder announced that people who for various reasons did not want to send their registration forms (e.g. births and namings) to the local church office could now send their forms to a central office located in Nykøbing Falster.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 2010 parents' duty to report the birth of their child was abolished. Instead, it was decided that in the future it was the task of the midwives to report all births in Denmark (only when a midwife isn't present at the birth of a child are the parents still obliged to report the birth of the child).</p><p>From 1 December 2014 all applications should be submitted in digital form whenever possible.</p><h3>Economic support[edit]</h3><p>§4 in the Constitution of Denmark stipulates that The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17] On the other hand, §68 ensures that citizens are not obliged to pay personal contributions to any religion other than their own.[17] It has been questioned how these two principles can co-exist. Non-members do not pay church tax, but an additional state subsidiary accounts for 12% of the Church's income. This means every citizen, even a non-member, contributes with an average of 130 kroner annually (US$23). In addition, the bishops are high-ranking officials whose salary is fully paid by the state. In return, certain public tasks are carried out by the Church, such as conducting vital records registries and managing graveyards which are open to all denominations.</p><h3>Separation of church and state[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Kierkegaard.jpg/170px-Kierkegaard.jpg" width="170" height="252"><br><p>The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard was an outspoken advocate of separation of church and state[18]</p><p>The debate about separation of church and state emerges occasionally in Denmark. The current arrangement is supported by most political parties. It has been challenged for decades by the left wing and by atheists; more recently also by some ideological liberals and some members of free churches.</p><p>Proponents for a separation (disestablishment) argue the state church violates equality of religions and the principle of the secular state. Proponents for the current system argue that membership is voluntary, that the existence of a state church has ancient historical roots, and that the church fulfils certain administrative tasks for the state. They also argue it would be difficult to decide whether church-owned real estate should be handed over to the state or not. The former possessions of the Catholic Church were ceded to the Crown at the reformation in 1536.</p><p>According to a poll conducted by the free daily MetroXpress in April 2007, 52% wished to split church and state, 30% were against, and 18% undecided. Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, spoke out against a split: Church and state will be separated when more than half of the population are no longer members. N. F. S. Grundtvig said so, and I support that. The opposition Social Democrats also argued against a split, but said there should be more equality between denominations, possibly by a state subsidiary paid to other approved religious communities as well.[19] Immigrant groups and the Muslim society are divided on the issue, as some think official Christianity is preferable to a purely secular state.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Pure equality of religions exists only in a minority of Western European countries. Besides Denmark, only the Faroe Islands, Iceland, England and Greece have official state churches, while Scotland has an officially recognised national church that is not connected to the state. Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria have official ties to Catholicism (concordat), but these ties do not extend to Catholicism being recognised as the state religion in these countries. Further there are varying degrees of public funding of the church in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Sweden in most cantons of Switzerland, and in the Alsace-Moselle region of France.</p><h3>Similar Nordic Evangelical-Lutheran churches[edit]</h3><h2>Controversial issues[edit]</h2><p>See also: Homosexuality and Lutheranism</p><h3>Female clergy[edit]</h3><p>The ordination of women, having been discussed within the church since the 1920s, has been allowed since 1948, despite some rather strong early resistance from the clergy. The then Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs was contacted by a parochial council who wished to employ a female priest. He decided there was no legal obstacle to that.[20] The first woman to become a bishop was instituted in 1995. Today two thirds of theology students are women, and the clergy is expected to have a female majority in the near future.</p><p>Among a small conservative minority, resistance to women ordained as clergy remains. In 2007 the Bishop of Viborg, known as a moderate conservative, revealed that he had given special consideration to priests who were known to be against ordained women. He had organised ordination ceremonies in such a way that new priests who so wished could avoid shaking hands with, or receiving the laying on of hands from, women ordained as priests. According to the bishop, this had happened twice in the 100 ordinations he had performed. The matter became headline news amidst a debate about Muslim fundamentalists who refuse to shake hands with members of the opposite sex. The Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Bertel Haarder, said he would discuss the matter with the bishops, but also stated that tolerance for various views should be respected. In contrast, the Minister for Employment, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, thought that the priests in question should be dismissed, as public employees are obliged to shake hands with anyone.[21]</p><h3>Same-sex marriage[edit]</h3><p>Further information: Same-sex marriage in Denmark</p><p>A 2011 poll of the Danish public found that 75.8% of Danes approve of same-sex marriages being performed in the church.[22]</p><p>According to a 2011 survey of 1137 priests, 62% of them supported same-sex marriage in the Church on the same basis as for heterosexuals, while 28% were against. A map of the results hints at the traditional west-east division, with a conservative wing being dominant in central West Jutland (the former Ringkjøbing Amt) and on Bornholm, but liberal priests dominating in most other areas.[23]</p><p>In 2004, a poll among pastors said 60% were against church marriage of same-sex couples.[24]</p><p>Early position of the church[edit]</p><p>Since Denmark approved same-sex civil unions (registered partnership) in 1989, the question of church blessing ceremonies for such unions emerged. After an enquiry from the Danish National Association of Gays and Lesbians in 1993, bishops set up a commission to reach a stance on the matter.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>An early stance on registered partnerships was reached in 1997. Bishops maintained that the ceremony of marriage was God's framework for the relation between a man and a woman, but this view of marriage was not affected by the fact that some people chose to live in a responsible community with a person of the same sex, approved by society, i.e. a registered partnership. The bishops disapproved of institutionalising new rituals, but couples who wished a non-ritualised marking in church of their registered partnership should be obliged. In such cases, it would be up to the rector to decide, and he should seek advice from his bishop.[25]</p><p>At this time, many churches chose to bless registered partnerships, however this blessing was distinguished from a legal ceremony, which was performed by a mayor or another municipal official.[26]</p><p>Same-sex marriages accepted[edit]</p><p>However, on 15 June 2012 the Church of Denmark made the decision to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and not merely bless them; therefore Denmark now recognises same-sex marriages. In early 2012 Minister for Equality, Ecclesiastical Affairs and Nordic Cooperation Manu Sareen introduced a bill approving same-sex marriage, which was passed in parliament in June 2012.[27] A wedding ritual with liturgy has been developed and presented to parliament by the eleven bishops who are in favor of same-sex marriages being performed in church.[28] Manu Sareen and a majority of bishops initially proposed the ritual would not declare the same-sex couple 'spouses', but 'life partners' (livsfæller, a Danish neologism), but the minister later changed his mind on this detail. Two conservative organisations within the church, Inner Mission and Lutheran Mission, as well as one of the twelve bishops, maintain their protests against same-sex marriage.[29] It will be up to each individual priest to decide whether he or she will conduct marriages of same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple was married on Friday 15 June.[30]</p><p>The process towards the official recognition of same sex marriage in the Church of Denmark began on 8 February 1973, when 'Provo Priest' Harald Søbye performed a wedding of a male couple, although not legally recognised, on a suggestion from a journalist at the newspaper Ekstra Bladet, which announced it as 'The World's First Gay Wedding'. On 25 February 1973 Harald Søbye performed another wedding, of a female couple, in a television programme. The state prosecutor investigated the cases, but concluded that the priest's use of his vestment was not illegal. Søbye had been retired in 1964 for political activism, but remained an ordained priest within the church. During the next 15 years, Søbye performed around 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples.[31]</p><p>When Denmark introduced registered partnerships in 1989, the issue of same-sex marriage for some years received little attention. Church blessings of these partnerships slowly gained ground (see above). Later, the possibility of registered partnership, or same-sex marriage, performed by the church came under discussion. The issue was brought up in an unusual way by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2004, who said he would approve of such a change, although he claimed to speak as a private person on this issue, not as prime minister.</p><p>Views among proponents vary whether such a ceremony should be called 'marriage' or merely 'registered partnership' (registreret partnerskab), as the present same-sex civil union is called. Most likely, clergy would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages or not, similar to the right to deny remarriage of divorced persons (a policy employed by a conservative minority of priests).</p><p>Constitutionality[edit]</p><p>A further controversy is that this new practice may be against the Danish constitution; §4 of the Danish constitution states: The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.[17]</p><p>§4 not only establish Folkekirken as the state church, but also gives certain boundaries as to what the state church is. It is forced to follow the Lutheran doctrines and if, as some critics claim [1], the Lutheran doctrines explicitly state that homosexuality is a sin then it is a violation of the constitution to allow gay marriages in the state church.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Gay clergy[edit]</h3><p>Gay and lesbian clergy exist, and this is generally considered a strictly personal issue. Parish councils are central in selecting and employing new priests, including interviews with candidates. Once employed, parish priests are public servants and cannot be discharged except for neglect of duties, which will finally be the bishop's decision.</p><p>In 2011 a female priest serving two small island parishes was fired after controversies with the parish council of Agersø, while the neighbouring Omø supported her. She claimed to have been ousted because of her sexuality, but the parish council rejected this accusation and mentioned 'cooperation problems' as the cause. Twenty years ago she had come out as lesbian and a practitioner of sadomasochism in a Swedish TV programme.[32][33]</p><p>In 2009 a parish priest in Tingbjerg, a Copenhagen suburb, moved away from the parish to a secret address after assaults against his vicarage, his car and the parish church. The vicarage was put up for sale. According to Avisen.dk, local youths claimed they harassed him because he was openly homosexual, among other reasons.[34] The priest himself denied this was the issue, but rather claimed the assaults were part of a general tendency in the 'crumbling district', and intensified after he spoke out in public about the local youth crime.[35] A Sunday service held a few weeks later was attended by several prominent guests supporting the priest, including Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, and photographer Jacob Holdt.[36] Tingbjerg is a single-plan public housing area, marked by gang violence and youth crime, and the most criminal district of Copenhagen.[37]</p><h3>Declaration Dominus Iesus[edit]</h3><p>In 2000, the Church of Denmark's ecumenical department publicly criticized the Roman Catholic declaration Dominus Iesus, which controversially used the term ecclesial community to refer to Protestant denominations, including Lutheran churches. The Church of Denmark argued that there is a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another of the right to be called a Church and that it is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian.[38]</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>Danish /'de?n??/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen) (dansk pronounced&nbsp;['dan?sg]&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen); dansk sprog, ['dan?sg 'sb??w?]) is a North Germanic language spoken by around six million people, principally in Denmark and in the region of Southern Schleswig in northern Germany, where it has minority language status.[3] There are also minor Danish-speaking communities in Norway, Sweden, Spain, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas, around 15–20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their home language.</p><p>Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples that lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic. A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as Mainland Scandinavian while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as Insular Scandinavian.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Until the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions. With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing, a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared, though there are regional variants of the standard language. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative.</p><p>Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 phonemically distinctive vowels,[4] and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon stød, a kind of laryngeal phonation type. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and weakly pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand,[5] and there is some evidence that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish.[6] The grammar is moderately inflective with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. As in English, Danish only has remnants of a former case system, particularly in the pronouns, and it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is V2, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/North_Germanic_languages.svg/300px-North_Germanic_languages.svg.png" width="300" height="200"><br><p>Danish and its relation to other North Germanic languages within the Germanic branch of Indo-European</p><p>Danish is a Germanic language of the North Germanic branch. Other names for this group are the Nordic or Scandinavian languages. Along with Swedish, Danish descends from the Eastern dialects of the Old Norse language; Danish and Swedish are also classified as East Scandinavian or East Nordic languages.[7][8]</p><p>Scandinavian languages are often considered a dialect continuum, where there are no sharp dividing lines between the different vernacular languages.[7]</p><p>Like Norwegian and Swedish, Danish was significantly influenced by Low German in the Middle Ages, and has been influenced by English since the turn of the 20th century.[7]</p><p>Danish itself can be divided into three main dialect areas: West Danish (Jutlandic), Insular Danish (including the Standard variety), and East Danish (including Bornholmian and Scanian). Under the view that Scandinavian is a dialect continuum, East Danish can be considered intermediary between Danish and Swedish, while Scanian can be considered a Swedified East Danish dialect, and Bornholmsk is its closest relative.[7]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Mutual intelligibility[edit]</h3><p>Danish is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Swedish. Proficient speakers of any of the three languages can often understand the others fairly well, though studies have shown that speakers of Norwegian generally understand both Danish and Swedish far better than Swedes or Danes understand each other. Both Swedes and Danes also understand Norwegian better than they understand each other's languages.[9] The reason Norwegian occupies a middle position in terms of intelligibility is because of its shared border with Sweden resulting in a similarity in pronunciation, combined with the long tradition of having Danish as a written language which has led to similarities in vocabulary.[10] Among younger Danes, Copenhageners are worse at understanding Swedish than Danes from the provinces, and in general younger Danes are not as good at understanding the neighboring languages as are Norwegian and Swedish youths.[9]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Danish</p><h3>Donsk tunga[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Old Norse</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG/250px-Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG" width="250" height="184"><br><p>The approximate extent of Old Norse and related languages in the early 10th century:

Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson[11]</p><p>By the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language was generally called the Danish tongue (Donsk tunga), or Norse language (Norrœnt mál). Norse was written in the runic alphabet, first with the elder futhark and from the 9th century with the younger futhark.</p><p>From the 7th century the common Norse language began to undergo changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, resulting in the appearance of two dialect areas, Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Denmark and Sweden). Most of the changes separating East Norse from West Norse started as innovations in Denmark, that spread through Scania into Sweden and by maritime contact to southern Norway.[12] A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the diphthong æi (Old West Norse ei) to the monophthong e, as in stæin to sten. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin. There was also a change of au as in dauðr into ø as in døðr. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tauþr into tuþr. Moreover, the øy (Old West Norse ey) diphthong changed into ø as well, as in the Old Norse word for island. This monophthongization started in Jutland and spread eastward, having spread throughout Denmark and most of Sweden by 1100.[13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Through Danish conquest, Old East Norse was once widely spoken in the northeast counties of England. Many words derived from Norse, such as gate (gade) for street, still survive in Yorkshire, the East Midlands and East Anglia, parts of eastern England colonized by Danish Vikings. The city of York was once the Viking settlement of Jorvik. Several other English words derive from Old East Norse, for example are (er), knife (kniv), husband (husbond), and egg (æg).[14] The suffix -by for 'town' is common in place names in Yorkshire and the east Midlands, for example Selby, Whitby, Derby and Grimsby. The word dale meaning valley is common in Yorkshire and Derbyshire placenames.</p><h3>Old Danish[edit]</h3><p>Fangær man saar i hor seng mæth annæns mansz kunæ. oc kumær han burt liuænd....

Jutlandic Law, 1241 [15]</p><p>In the medieval period Danish emerged as a separate language from Swedish. The main written language was Latin, and the few Danish language texts preserved from this period are written in the Latin alphabet, although the runic alphabet seems to have lingered in popular usage in some areas. The main text types written in this period are laws, which were formulated in the vernacular language to be accessible also to those who were not latinate. The Jutlandic Law and Scanian Law were written in vernacular Danish in the early 13th century. Beginning in 1350 Danish began to be used as a language of administration and new types of literature began to be written in the language, such as royal letters and testaments. The orthography in this period was not standardized nor was the spoken language, and the regional laws demonstrate the dialectal differences between the regions in which they were written.[16]</p><p>Throughout this period Danish was in contact with Low German, and many Low German loans were introduced in this period.[17] With the Protestant Reformation in 1536, Danish also became the language of religion, which sparked a new interest in using Danish as a literary language. It is also in this period that Danish begins to take on the linguistic traits that differentiate it from Swedish and Norwegian, such as the stød the voicing of many stop consonants, and the weakening of many final vowels to /e/.[18]</p><p>The first printed book in Danish dates from 1495, the Rimkrøniken (Rhyming Chronicle), a history book told in rhymed verses.[19] The first complete translation of the Bible in Danish, the Bible of Christian II translated by Christiern Pedersen was published in 1550. Pedersen's orthographic choices set the de facto standard for subsequent writing in Danish.[20]</p><h3>Early Modern Danish[edit]</h3><p>Herrer og Narre have frit Sprog.

Peder Syv, proverbs</p><p>Following the first Bible translation the development of Danish as a written language, and as a language of religion, administration and public discourse sped up. In the second half of the 17th century a number of grammarians elaborated grammars of Danish, first among them Rasmus Bartholin's 1657 Latin grammar De studio lingvæ danicæ; then Laurids Olufsen Kock's 1660 grammar of the Zealand dialect Introductio ad lingvam Danicam puta selandicam; and in 1685 the first Danish grammar written in Danish, Den Danske Sprog-Kunst (The Art of the Danish Language) by Peder Syv. Significant authors from this period are Thomas Kingo, poet and psalmist, and Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, whose novel Jammersminde (Remembered Woes) is considered a literary masterpiece. Orthography was still not standardized and the principles for doing so were vigorously discussed among Danish philologists. The grammar of Jens Pedersen Høysgaard was the first to give a detailed analysis of Danish phonology and prosody, including a description of the stød. In this period scholars were also discussing whether it was best to write as one speaks or to speak as one writes, including whether archaic grammatical forms that had fallen out of use in the vernacular, such as the plural form of verbs, should be conserved in writing (i.e. han er he is vs. de ere they are).</p><p>The East Danish provinces were lost to Sweden after the Treaty of Brömsebro after which they were gradually Swedified; just as Norway was politically severed from Denmark, begininnig also a gradual end of Danish influence on Norwegian (influence through the shared written standard language remained). With the introduction of absolutism in 1660, the Danish state was further integrated, and the language of the chancellery, a Zealandic variety with German and French influence, became the de facto official standard language, especially in writing - this was the original so-called rigsdansk (Danish of the Realm). Also beginning in the mid 18th century, the skarre-R, the uvular R sound ([?]), began spreading through Denmark, probably through influence from Parisian French and German. It affected all of the areas where Danish had been influential, including all of Denmark, Southern Sweden and coastal southern Norway.[21]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 18th century Danish philology was advanced by Rasmus Rask, who pioneered the disciplines of comparative and historical linguistics and wrote the first English language grammar of Danish. Literary Danish flourished with the works of Ludvig Holberg, whose plays and historical and scientific works laid the foundation for the Danish literary canon. With the Danish colonization of Greenland by Hans Egede, Danish became the administrative and religious language there, while Iceland and the Faroe Islands had the status of Danish colonies with Danish as an official language up until the mid 20th century.</p><h3>Standardized national language[edit]</h3><p>Moders navn er vort Hjertesprog,

N.F.S. Grundtvig, "Modersmaalet"</p><p>Following the loss of Schleswig to Germany, a sharp influx of German speakers moved into the area, eventually outnumbering the Danish speakers. The political loss of territory sparked a period of intense nationalism in Denmark, coinciding with the so-called Golden Age of Danish culture. Authors such as N.F.S. Grundtvig emphasized the role of language in creating national belonging. Some of the most cherished Danish language authors of this period are existential philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and prolific fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen.[22] The influence of popular literary role models, together with increased requirements of education did much to strengthen the Danish language, and also started a period of homogenization, whereby the Copenhagen standard language gradually displaced the regional vernacular languages. After the Schleswig referendum in 1920 a number of Danes remained as a minority within German territories.[23] Throughout the 19th Century Danes emigrated, establishing small expatriate communities in the Americas, particularly in the US, Canada, and Argentina where memory and some use of Danish remains today.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png/220px-LinguisticSituationSchleswigSlesvig.png" width="220" height="237"><br><p>Language shift in the 19th century in Southern Schleswig.</p><p>After the occupation of Denmark by Germany in World War II, the 1948 orthography reform dropped the German influenced rule of capitalizing nouns, and introduced the letter Å/å. Three 20th century Danish authors have become Nobel Prize laureates in Literature: Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan (joint recipients in 1917) and Johannes V. Jensen (awarded 1944).</p><p>With the exclusive use of rigsdansk, the High Copenhagenian Standard, in national broadcasting, the traditional dialects came under increased pressure. In the 20th century they have all but disappeared, and the standard language has extended throughout the country.[24] Minor regional pronunciation variation of the standard language, sometimes called regionssprog (regional languages) remain, and are in some cases vital. Today the major varieties of Standard Danish are High Copenhagenian, associated with elderly, well to-do and well educated people of the capital, and low-Copenhagenian traditionally associated with the working class, but today adopted as the prestige variety of the younger generations.[25][26] Also in the 21st century the influence of immigration has had linguistic consequences, such as the emergence of a so-called multiethnolect in the urban areas, an immigrant Danish variety (also known as Perkerdansk), combining elements of different immigrant languages such as Arabic, Turkish and Kurdish, as well as English and Danish.[25]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Geographic distribution[edit]</h2><p>Danish is the national language of Denmark and one of two official languages of the Faroe Islands (alongside Faroese). Until 2009, it had also been one of two official languages of Greenland (alongside Greenlandic). Danish is widely spoken in Greenland now as lingua franca, and an unknown portion of the native Greenlandic population has Danish as their first language; a large percentage of the native Greenlandic population speak Danish as a second language since its introduction into the education system as a compulsory language in 1928. Danish was an official language in Iceland until 1944, but is today still widely used and is a mandatory subject in school taught as a second foreign language after English.[27]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG/220px-Learn_Danish_in_Germany%2C_2012%2C_ubt.JPG" width="220" height="124"><br><p>Learn Danish banner in Flensburg, Germany where it is an officially recognized regional language</p><p>In addition, there is a noticeable community of Danish speakers in Southern Schleswig, the portion of Germany bordering Denmark, where it is an officially recognized regional language, just as German is north of the border. Furthermore, Danish is one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council.[28] Under the Nordic Language Convention, Danish-speaking citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.[28]</p><p>The more widespread of the two varieties of Norwegian, Bokmål, is very close to Danish, because standard Danish was used as the de facto administrative language until 1814. Bokmål is based on Danish unlike the other variety of Norwegian, Nynorsk, which is based on the Norwegian dialects, with Old Norwegian as an important reference point.[7]</p><p>There is no law stipulating an official language for Denmark, making Danish the de facto language only. The Code of Civil Procedure does, however, lay down Danish as the language of the courts.[29] Since 1997 public authorities have been obliged to observe the official spelling by way of the Orthography Law. In the 21st century there have been discussions regarding creating a language law that would make Danish the official language of Denmark.[30]</p><h2>Dialects[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish dialects</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Danishdialectmap.png/250px-Danishdialectmap.png" width="250" height="184"><br><p>Map of Danish dialects</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Denmark-stoed.png/220px-Denmark-stoed.png" width="220" height="258"><br><p>A map showing the distribution of stød in Danish dialects.

In Zealand the transition from three to two genders has happened fairly recently. West of the red line the definite article goes before the word as in English or German; east of the line it takes the form of a suffix.</p><p>Standard Danish (rigsdansk) is the language based on dialects spoken in and around the capital, Copenhagen. Unlike Swedish and Norwegian, Danish does not have more than one regional speech norm. More than 25% of all Danish speakers live in the metropolitan area of the capital, and most government agencies, institutions, and major businesses keep their main offices in Copenhagen, something that has resulted in a very homogeneous national speech norm.[24][7]</p><p>Danish dialects can be divided into the traditional dialects, which differ from modern Standard Danish in both phonology and grammar, and the Danish accents or regional languages, which are local varieties of the Standard language distinguished mostly by pronunciation and local vocabulary colored by traditional dialects. Traditional dialects are now mostly extinct in Denmark, with only the oldest generations still speaking them.[31][24]</p><p>Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas:</p><p>Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic. Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn and Lolland-Falster dialect areas - each with addition internal variation. The term Eastern Danish[35] is occasionally used for Bornholmian, but including the dialects of Scania (particularly in a historical context). Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish and Bornholmian. Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to Sweden and subsequently swedified.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Traditional dialects differ both in phonology, grammar and vocabulary from standard Danish. Phonologically, one of the most diagnostic differences is the presence or absence of stød.[36] There are four main regional variants for the realization of stød: In Southeastern Jutlandic, Southernmost Funen, Southern Langeland and Ærø, there is no stød but instead a pitch accent. South of a line (Danish: Stødgrænsen The Stød border) going through central South Jutland, crossing Southern Funen and central Langeland and north of Lolland-Falster, Møn, Southern Zealand and Bornholm there is neither stød nor pitch accent.[37] In most of Jutland and on Zealand there is stød, and in Zealandic traditional dialects and regional language there are often more stød occurrences than in the standard language. In Zealand the stød line divides Southern Zealand (without stød), an area which used to be directly under the Crown, from the rest of the Island that used to be the property of various noble estates.[38][39]</p><p>Grammatically, a dialectally significant feature is the number of grammatical genders. Standard Danish has two genders and the definite form of nouns is formed by the use of suffixes, while Western Jutlandic has only one gender and the definite form of nouns uses an article before the noun itself, in the same fashion as West Germanic languages. The Bornholmian dialect has maintained to this day many archaic features, such as a distinction between three grammatical genders.[34] Insular Danish traditional dialects also conserved three grammatical genders. By 1900 Zealand insular dialects had been reduced to two genders under influence from the standard language, but other Insular varieties, such as Funen dialect had not.[40] Besides using three genders, the old Insular or Funen dialect, could also use personal pronouns (like he and she) in certain cases, particularly referring to animals. A classic example in traditional Funen dialect is the sentence: Katti, han får unger, literally The cat, he is having kittens, because cat is a male noun, and thus are referred to as han (he), even if it is female cat.[41]</p><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish phonology</p><p>The sound system of Danish is unusual among the world's languages, particularly in its large vowel inventory and in the unusual prosody. In informal or rapid speech the language is prone to considerable reduction of unstressed syllables, creating many vowel-less syllables with syllabic consonants, as well as reduction of final consonants. Furthermore, the language's prosody does not include many clues about the sentence structure, unlike many other languages, making it relatively more difficult to segment the speech flow into its constituent elements.[5][42] These factors taken together make Danish pronunciation difficult to master for learners, and there are even indications that Danish children take slightly longer in learning to segment speech in early childhood.[6]</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><p>Although somewhat depending on analysis, most modern variants of Danish distinguish 12 long vowels, 13 short vowels and two schwa vowels, /?/ and /?/ that only occur in unstressed syllables. This gives a total of 27 different vowel phonemes - a very large number among the world's languages.[43] At least 19 different diphthongs also occur, all with a short first vowel and the second segment being either [i?], [u?] or [??].[44] The table below shows the approximate distribution of the vowels as given by Grønnum (1998) in Modern Standard Danish, with the symbols used in IPA for Danish. Questions of analysis may give a slightly different inventory, for example based on whether r-colored vowels are considered distinct phonemes. Basbøll (2005):50 gives 25 full vowels, not counting the two unstressed schwa-vowels.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>The consonant inventory is comparatively simple. Basbøll (2005:73) distinguishes 16 non-syllabic consonant phonemes in Danish.</p><p>Many of these phonemes have quite different allophones in onset and coda. Phonetically there is no voicing distinction among the stops, rather the distinction is one of aspiration and fortis vs. lenis.[44] /p t k/ are aspirated in onset realized as [b??, d??, g°?], but not in coda. The pronunciation of t, [d??], is in between a simple aspirated [d??] and a fully affricated [d?s] as has happened in German with many words that now contain z. The stops /b d g/ are realized as [b?, d?, g°] in onset and as [b? ð???, j/??] in coda. In syllable onset the phonemes /b d g v j r/ are contoid (having enough closure to produce friction), but in coda syllables they become vocoids, with no audible friction making them phonetically similar to vowels. For example, /v b/ is pronounced as a [w]-sound in syllable coda e.g. /grav, løb/ (grave, ran) are pronounced [grau?, løu?].</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>[?, ð] often have slight frication, but are usually pronounced as approximants. Danish [ð] differs from the similar sound in English and Icelandic, in that it is not a dental fricative but an alveolar approximant which sounds like and is frequently mistaken for an [l] (or [?]) by second language learners.[44]</p><p>The sound [?] is found for example in the word /sjov?/ fun pronounced [??u??] and /tjal?/ marijuana pronounced [t?al?]. Some analyses have posited it as a phoneme, but since it occurs only after /s/ or /t/ and [j] doesn't occur after these phonemes, it can be analyzed as an allophone of /j/, which is devoiced after voiceless alveolar frication. This makes it unnecessary to postulate a /?/-phoneme in Danish.[46]</p><p>In onset /r/ is realized as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant, [?], but in coda it is either realized as a non-syllabic low central vowel, [??] or simply coalesces with the preceding vowel. The phenomenon is comparable to the r in German or in non-rhotic pronunciations of English. The Danish pronunciation of /r/ as a so-called skarre-r distinguishes the language from those varieties of Norwegian and Swedish that use trilled [r].</p><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Danish is characterized by a prosodic feature called stød (lit. thrust). This is a form of laryngealization or creaky voice. Some sources have described it as a glottal stop, but this is a very infrequent realization, and today phoneticians consider it a phonation type or a prosodic phenomenon.[47] It has phonemic status, since it serves as the sole distinguishing feature of words with different meanings in minimal pairs such as bønder (peasants) with stød, versus bønner (beans) without stød. The distribution of stød in the vocabulary is related to the distribution of the common Scandinavian pitch accents found in most dialects of Norwegian and Swedish.[48]</p><p>Stress is phonemic and distinguishes words such as billigst ['bilist] cheapest and bilist [bi'list] car driver.[49]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish grammar</p><p>Similarly to the case of English, modern Danish grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Danish, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs tager/tog (takes/took) and fod/fødder (foot/feet)) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as elsker/elskede love/loved, bil/biler car/cars). Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typically for an Indo-European language, Danish follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Danish distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections and ideophones.[50]</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are inflected for number (singular vs. plural) and definiteness, and are classified into two grammatical genders. Only pronouns inflect for case, and the previous genitive case has become an enclitic. A distinctive feature of the Scandinavian languages, including Danish, is that the definite articles, which also mark noun gender, have developed into suffixes. Typically of Germanic languages plurals are either irregular or strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem (e.g. fod/fødder foot/feet, mand/mænd man/men) or weak stems inflected through affixation (e.g. skib/skibe ship/ships, kvinde/kvinder woman/women).[51]</p><p>Gender[edit]
Main article: Gender in Danish and Swedish</p><p>Standard Danish has two nominal genders: common and neuter; the common gender arose as the historical feminine and masculine genders conflated into a single category. Some traditional dialects retain a three-way gender distinction, between masculine, feminine and neuter, and some dialects of Jutland have a masculine/feminine contrast. While the majority of Danish nouns (ca. 75%) have the common gender, and neuter is often used for inanimate objects, the genders of nouns are not generally predictable and must in most cases be memorized.The gender of a noun determines the form of adjectives that modify it, and the form of the definite suffixes. [52]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Definiteness[edit]</p><p>Definiteness is marked by two mutually exclusive articles, a preposed demonstrative article which occurs with nouns that are modified by an adjective or a postposed enclitic.[53] Neuter nouns take the clitic -et, and common gender nouns take -en. Indefinite nouns take the articles en (common gender) or et (neuter). Hence, the common gender noun en mand a man (indefinite) has the definite form manden the man, whereas the neuter noun et hus a house (indefinite) has the definite form, the house (definite) huset.[52] [54]</p><p>Indefinite:</p><p>Jeg så et hus
"I saw a house"</p><p>Definite with enclitic article:</p><p>Jeg så huset
"I saw the house"</p><p>Definite with preposed demonstrative article:</p><p>Jeg så det store hus[55]
"I saw the big house"</p><p>The plural definite ending is -(e)ne (e.g. drenge boys &gt; drengene the boys and piger girls &gt; pigerne the girls), and nouns ending in -ere lose the last -e before adding the -ne suffix (e.g. danskere Danes &gt; danskerne the Danes). When the noun is modified by an adjective, the definiteness is marked by the definite article den (common) or det (neuter) and the definite/plural form of the adjective: den store mand the big man, det store hus the big house.[56][54]</p><p>Number[edit]</p><p>There are three different types of regular plurals: Class 1 forms the plural with the suffix -er (indefinite) and -erne (definite), Class 2 with the suffix -e (indefinite) and -ene (definite.), and Class 3 takes no suffix for the plural indefinite form and -ene for the plural definite.[57]</p><p>Most irregular nouns take an ablaut plural (with a change in the stem vowel), or combine ablaut stem-change with the suffix, and some have unique plural forms. Unique forms may be inherited (e.g. the plural of øje eye, which is the old dual form øjne), or for loan words they may be borrowed from the donor language (e.g. the word konto account which is borrowed from Italian and uses the Italian masculine plural form konti accounts).[58][59]</p><p>Possession[edit]</p><p>Possessive phrases are formed with the enclitic -s, for example min fars hus my father's house where the noun far carries the possessive enclitic.[60] This is however not a case of genitive case marking, because in the case of longer noun phrases the -s attaches to the last word in the phrase, which need not be the head-noun or even a noun at all. For example, the phrases kongen af Danmark's bolsjefabrik the king of Denmark's candy factory, or det er pigen Uffe bor sammen meds datter that is the daughter of the girl that Uffe lives with, where the enclitic attaches to a stranded preposition.[61][62]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>As does English, the Danish pronominal system retains a distinction between subjective and oblique case. The subjective case form of pronouns is used when pronouns occur as grammatical subject of a sentence, and oblique forms are used for all non-subjective occurrences including accusative, dative, predicative, comparative and other types of constructions. The third person singular pronouns also distinguish between and animate masculine (han he), animate feminine (hun she) forms, as well as inanimate neuter (det it) and inanimate common gender (den it) [63]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Jeg sover
"I sleep"


Du sover
"you sleep"


Jeg kysser dig
"I kiss you"


du kysser mig
"you kiss me"</p><p>Possessive pronouns have independent and adjectival forms. The adjectival form is used immediately preceding the possessed noun (det er min hest it is my horse), whereas the independent possessive pronoun is used in place of the possessed noun (den er min it is mine). In the third person singular sin is used when the owner is also the subject of the sentence, whereas hans (his), hendes (her) and dens/dets its is used when the owner is different from the grammatical subject.[64][65]</p><p>Han tog sin hat
He took his (own) hat


Han tog hans hat
He took his hat (someone else's hat)

Nominal compounds[edit]</p><p>Like all Germanic languages, Danish forms compound nouns. These are represented in Danish orthography as one word, as in kvindehåndboldlandsholdet, the female national handball team. In some cases, nouns are joined with an extra s, originally possessive in function, like landsmand (from land, country, and mand, man, meaning compatriot), but landmand (from same roots, meaning farmer). Some words are joined with an extra e, like gæstebog (from gæst and bog, meaning guest book).</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>Danish verbs are morphologically simple, marking very few grammatical categories. They do not mark person or number of subject, although the marking of plural subjects was still used in writing as late as the 19th century. Verbs have a past, non-past and infinitive form, past and present participle forms, and a passive, and an imperative.[66]</p><p>Tense, Aspect, Mood, Voice[edit]</p><p>Verbs can be divided into two main classes, the strong/irregular verbs and the regular/weak verbs.[53] The regular verbs are also divided into two classes, those that take the past suffix -te and those that take the suffix -ede.[67]</p><p>The infinitive always ends in a vowel, usually -e (pronounced [?]), infinitive forms are preceded by the article at (pronounced [?]).[67] The non-past or present tense takes the suffix -r, except for a few strong verbs that have irregular non-past forms. The past form does not necessarily mark past tense, but also counterfactuality or conditionality, and the non-past has many uses besides present tense time reference.[68]</p><p>The present participle ends in -ende (e.g. løbende running), and the past participle ends in -et (e.g. løbet run), -t (e.g. købt bought). Additional composite tenses are constructed with auxiliary verbs (e.g. at være to be and at have to have) and participial forms:</p><p>Hun er gået
"She has left"


Hun har gået
"She has walked"


Hun var gået
"She had left"


Hun blev siddende
She remained seated (lit. "she stayed sitting")</p><p>The passive form takes the suffix -s: avisen læses hver dag (the newspaper is read every day). Another passive construction uses the auxiliary verb at blive to become: avisen bliver læst hver dag.[68][69]</p><p>The imperative mood is formed from the infinitive by removing the final schwa-vowel:</p><p>løb!
"run!"</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Danish basic constituent order in simple sentences with both a subject and an object is Subject-Verb-Object.[70] However, Danish is also a V2 language, which means that the verb must always be the second constituent of the sentence. Following the Danish grammarian Paul Diderichsen[71] Danish grammar tends to be analyzed as consisting of slots or fields, and in which certain types of sentence material can be moved to the pre-verbal (or grounding) field to achieve different pragmatic effects. Usually the sentence material occupying the preverbal slot has to be pragmatically marked, usually either new information or topics. There is no rule that subjects must occur in the preverbal slot, but since subject and topic often coincide, they often do. Therefore, whenever any sentence material that is not the subject occurs in the preverbal position the subject is demoted to postverbal position and the sentence order becomes VSO.[72]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Peter (S) så (V) Jytte (O)
"Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>but</p><p>I går så (V) Peter (S) Jytte (O)
"Yesterday, Peter saw Jytte"</p><p>When there is no pragmatically marked constituents in the sentence to take the preverbal slot (for example when all the information is new), the slot has to take a dummy subject der.[73]</p><p>der kom en pige ind ad døren
there came a girl in through the door
"A girl came in the door"

Main clauses[edit]</p><p>Haberland (1994, p.&nbsp;336) describes the basic order of sentence constituents in main clauses as comprising the following 8 positions:</p><p>Position 0 is not part of the sentence and can only contain sentential connectors (such as conjunctions or interjections). Position 1 can contain any sentence constituent. Position 2 can only contain the main verb. Position 3 is the subject position, unless the subject is fronted to occur in position 1. Position 4 can only contain light adverbs and the negation. Position 5 is for non-finite verbs, such as auxiliaries. Position 6 is the position of direct and indirect objects, and position 7 is for heavy adverbial constituents.[72]</p><p>Questions with wh-words are formed differently from yes/no questions. In wh-questions the question word occupies the preverbal field, regardless of whether its grammatical role is subject or object or adverbial. In yes/no questions the preverbal field is empty, so that the sentence begins with the verb.</p><p>Wh-question:</p><p>hvem så du?'
who saw you
"who did you see?"


så du ham?
saw you him?
"did you see him?"

Subordinate clauses[edit]</p><p>In subordinate clauses, the syntax differs from that of main clauses. In the subordinate clause structure the verb is preceded by the subject and any light adverbial material (e.g. negation).[74] Complement clauses begin with the particle at in the connector field.</p><p>Han sagde at han ikke ville gå
he said that he not would go
"He said that he did not want to go"</p><p>Relative clauses are marked by the relative articles som or der which occupy the preverbal slot:</p><p>Jeg kender en mand som bor i Helsingør[75]
"I know a man who lives in Elsinore"</p><h2>Vocabulary[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG/220px-Danish_military_police_Mercedes.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Danish label reading militærpoliti, "military police", on police vehicle</p><p>About 2000 of Danish non-compound words are derived from the Old Norse language, and ultimately from Proto Indo-European. Of these 2000 words, 1200 are nouns, 500 are verbs, 180 are adjectives and the rest belong to other word classes.[76] Danish has also absorbed a considerable number of loan words, most of which were borrowed from Middle Low German in the late medieval period. Out of the 500 most frequently used Words in Danish, 100 are Medieval loans from Middle Low German.[77] In the 17th and 18th Centuries standard German and French superseded Low German influence and in the 20th Century English became the main supplier of loan words, especially after World War II. Although many old Nordic words remain, some were replaced with borrowed synonyms, as can be seen with æde (to eat) which became less common when the Low German spise came into fashion. As well as loan words, new words are freely formed by compounding existing words. In standard text in contemporary Danish, Middle Low German loans account for about 16-17% of the vocabulary, Graeco-Latin-loans 4-8&nbsp;%, French 2-4&nbsp;% and English about 1%.[77]</p><p>Danish and English are both Germanic languages, Danish a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse and English a West Germanic language descended from Old English, and Old Norse exerted a strong influence on Old English in the early medieval period. To see their shared Germanic heritage, one merely has to note the many common words that are very similar in the two languages. For example, Danish words for commonly used nouns and prepositions are easily recognizable in their written form to English speakers, such as have, over, under, for, give, flag, salt, and kat.[78] Similarly, some other words are almost identical to their Scottish equivalents, e.g., kirke (Scottish kirk, i.e., 'church') or barn (Scottish bairn, i.e. 'child'). In addition, the word by, meaning village or town, occurs in many English place-names, such as Whitby and Selby, as remnants of the Viking occupation. During the latter period, English adopted are, the third person plural form of the verb to be, as well as the corresponding personal pronoun form they from contemporary Old Norse.</p><h3>Numerals[edit]</h3><p>In the word forms of numbers above 20, the units are stated before the tens, so 21 is rendered enogtyve, literally one and twenty.</p><p>The numeral halvanden means 1½ (literally half second, implying one plus half of the second one). The numerals halvtredje (2½), halvfjerde (3½) and halvfemte (4½) are obsolete, but still implicitly used in the vigesimal system described below. Similarly, the temporal designation klokken halv tre, literally half three o'clock, is half past two.</p><p>One peculiar feature of the Danish language is the fact that numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 are (somewhat like the French numerals from 80 through 99) based on a vigesimal system, meaning that the score (20) is used as a base unit in counting. Tres (short for tre-sinds-tyve, three times twenty) means 60, while 50 is halvtreds (short for halvtredje-sinds-tyve, half third times twenty, implying two score plus half of the third score). The ending sindstyve meaning times twenty is no longer included in cardinal numbers, but still used in ordinal numbers. Thus, in modern Danish fifty-two is usually rendered as tooghalvtreds from the now obsolete tooghalvtredsindstyve, whereas 52nd is either tooghalvtredsende or tooghalvtredsindstyvende. Twenty is tyve (derived from old Danish tiughu, a haplology of tuttiughu, meaning 'two tens'[79]), while thirty is tredive (Old Danish þrjatiughu, three tens), and forty is fyrre (Old Danish fyritiughu, four tens[80] via fyrretyve.[81] Thus, the suffix -tyve should be understood as a plural of ti (10), though to modern Danes tyve means 20, making it hard to explain why fyrretyve is 40 (four tens) and not 80 (four times twenty).</p><p>For large numbers (one billion or larger), Danish uses the long scale, so that the short scale billion (1,000,000,000) is called milliard, and the short scale trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is billion.</p><h2>Writing system[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Main article: Danish orthography</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG/220px-Illuminated_keyboard_2.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Danish keyboard with keys for Æ, Ø, and Å.</p><p>The oldest preserved examples of written Danish (from the Iron and Viking Ages) are in the Runic alphabet.[82] The introduction of Christianity also brought the Latin script to Denmark, and at the end of the High Middle Ages Runes had more or less been replaced by Latin letters.</p><p>Danish orthography is highly conservative, still using most of the conventions established in the 16th century. The spoken language however has changed a lot since then, creating a severe gap between the spoken and written languages.[83]</p><p>The modern Danish alphabet is similar to the English one, with three additional letters: æ, ø, and å, which come at the end of the alphabet, in that order. A spelling reform in 1948 introduced the letter å, already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the digraph aa.[82] The old usage still occurs in some personal and geographical names (for example, the name of the city of Aalborg is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and Aarhus decided to go back to Aa in 2011). When representing the å sound, aa is treated just like å in alphabetical sorting, even though it looks like two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations (e.g., in URLs), they are often replaced by ae (Æ, æ), oe or o (Ø, ø), and aa (Å, å), respectively.</p><p>The same spelling reform changed the spelling of a few common words, such as the past tense vilde (would), kunde (could) and skulde (should), to their current forms of ville, kunne and skulle (making them identical to the infinitives in writing, as they are in speech). Modern Danish and Norwegian use the same alphabet, though spelling differs slightly, particularly with the phonetic spelling of loanwords; for example the spelling of station and garage in Danish remains identical to other languages, whereas in Norwegian, they are transliterated as stasjon and garasje.</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p>Åkesson, K.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Dano-Norwegian empire)
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The Danish colonial empire (Danish: danske kolonier) and pre Dano-Norwegian empire (Norwegian: Danmark-Norges kolonier) denotes the colonies that Denmark-Norway (Denmark alone after 1814) possessed from 1536 until 1953. At its apex the colonial empire spanned four continents (Europe, South America, Africa and Asia). The period of colonial expansion marked a rise in the status and power of Danes and Norwegians in the union. Being the hegemon of Denmark-Norway or the Statsfædrelandet (lit. State Fathers' Land), Denmark is where the union's monumental palaces are now located and Copenhagen, today the capital of Denmark, was the city which both Norway and Denmark came to establish as their capital. Much of the Norwegian population moved to find work in Copenhagen, attend the University, or join the Royal Fleet. At it height the empire had an area of 2,655,564.76 km2 [1]</p><p>In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in Africa, the Caribbean, and India. After 1814, when Norway was granted to Sweden following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained what remained of Norway's great medieval colonial holdings. Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway's overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe. Denmark-Norway's first colony was established at Tranquebar (Trankebar) on India's southern coast in 1620. Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.</p><p>Today, the only remaining vestiges of this empire are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953. They are now autonomous countries of the Kingdom of Denmark with home rule, in a relationship referred to as the Unity of the Realm.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Overview[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish Gold Coast</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg/250px-Christiansborg_Castle2.jpg" width="250" height="148"><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>A contemporary depiction of Fort Christiansborg</p><p>Denmark maintained several tradings stations and four forts on the Gold Coast in west Africa, especially around modern day Ghana. Three trading stations were built:[2] Fort Frederiksborg, Kpompo; Osu Castle by Accra in 1661, that was purchased from Sweden; and Frederiksberg. The forts were Fort Prinsensten built in 1784, Fort Augustaborg from 1787, Fort Friedensborg and Fort Kongensten, several of which are ruins today. Of these, only one is still used today, Fort Christiansborg, which is the Ghanaian president's residence in Ghana.</p><p>Plantations were established by Frederiksborg, but they failed. Fort Christiansborg became the base for Danish power in west Africa, and the centre for slave trade to the Danish West Indies. In 1807, Denmark's African business partners were suppressed by the Akan people subgroup-Ashanti, which led to the abandonment of all trading stations. Denmark sold its forts to the United Kingdom in 1850.</p><h3>Americas[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Danish colonization of the Americas</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg/220px-H%C3%B8gensborg%2C_Plantation%2C_St._Croix%2C_Danish_West_Indies.jpg" width="220" height="178"><br><p>The Høgensborg estate on St. Croix, Danish West Indies, 1833


Greenland[edit]
Main articles: History of Greenland and Royal Greenland Trade Department</p><p>With the ratification of the Kalmar Union in 1397, Denmark-Norway inherited Greenland which was previously part of Norway since its settlement in the Viking Age. After the Norse settlement in Greenland finally disappeared in the 15th century, Europeans did not settle the island again until 1721, when the Lutheran minister Hans Egede arrived and established the town now known as Nuuk. After Norway was ceded to Sweden in 1814 following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the old territorial claims as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel.</p><p>The development and settlement of Greenland accelerated in 1945, instigated by the region's geostrategic importance in the Cold War era, itself exemplified and manifested by the US-Air base of Thule from 1943. Another reason and driving force was the emergence of fundamental technical abilities, such as aircraft and icebreakers at Greenland's disposition, giving the otherwise remote island a supply situation somewhat similar to Europe.</p><p>Danish West Indies[edit]
Main articles: Danish West Indies and Danish West India Company</p><p>Denmark-Norway acquired the island of St. Thomas in 1671[2] and St. Jan (now St. John) in 1718, and bought St. Croix from France in 1733. All of the islands' economies were based primarily on sugar. These islands were known as the Danish West Indies and were eventually sold to the United States in 1917 for 25 million dollars.[2] Several Danish-American succession talks had been made since 1870 due to a rising number of riots and unrest from the poorer English speaking population. The Zahle Government (1914-1920) held a heavily boycotted election for Danish mainland constituencies, which produced a minority for the sale of the islands. The United States hoped to use them as naval bases. Since 1917, the islands have been known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish India and Danish East India Company</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png/300px-European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png" width="300" height="184"><br><p>Danish and other European settlements in India.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/250px-A_view_of_Tranquebar_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="250" height="118"><br><p>Fort Dansborg at Tranquebar, built by Ove Gjedde, c. 1658</p><p>Denmark maintained a scattering of small colonies and trading posts throughout the Indian sub-continent from the 17th to 19th centuries, after which most were sold or ceded to Britain which had become the dominant power there.[2] The most important economic aspect was spice trade and access to the east Asian area, including Imperial China situated farther to the east.</p><p>The colony at Trankebar (modern day: Tharangambadi) was kept for over 200 years, with a few interruptions, until it was sold to the British in 1845.</p><p>In 1755 Denmark acquired the Frederiksnagore (now Serampore), and later the towns of Achne and Pirapur. They are located about 25 kilometres north of Calcutta. In 1818 Serampore College was established in Serampore, which still exists today. These towns were also sold to Britain in 1845. Other colonial ventures include colonization attempts of the Nicobar Islands, called Frederiksøerne (Frederik Islands) or Ny Danmark (New Denmark) by the Danes between 1754 and 1868.</p><h3>Atlantic[edit]</h3><p>Faroe Islands[edit]
Main article: History of the Faroe Islands</p><p>As with Greenland, Denmark-Norway inherited the medieval Norwegian claims to the Faroe Islands as the successor state to Norway. The Faroes had become part of the Kingdom of Norway in 1035. After Norway was given to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark retained the Faroes as a condition of the Treaty of Kiel. Status as a Danish county ended in 1948, and the Faroes were given a large degree of independence within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>Iceland[edit]

Also like those possessions, Iceland was retained by Denmark at the Treaty of Kiel. A growing independence movement in Iceland led to Denmark granting it home rule in 1874 and expanding that home rule in 1904. In 1918 Iceland became a fully sovereign kingdom, titled the Kingdom of Iceland, in personal union with Denmark.</p><p>During Nazi Germany's Occupation of Denmark (1940) the Republic of Iceland was declared on June 17, 1944.</p><h3>Danish Estonia and Courland[edit]</h3><p>Main articles: Danish Estonia and Bishopric of Courland</p><p>In the 13th-14th centuries, Denmark ruled parts of what is now Estonia. The colony was initially named the Duchy of Estonia (Danish: Hertugdømmet Estland) and is retrospectively called Danish Estonia by historians. In 1559 the bishop of Courland and Ösel-Wiek Johannes V von Münchhausen sold his lands to the King Frederick II of Denmark for 30,000 thalers. The Danish king gave the territory to his younger brother Duke Magnus of Holstein. After Magnus of Livonia died in 1583, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth invaded his territories in the Bishopric of Courland and Frederick II of Denmark decided to sell his rights of inheritance. In 1645, Saaremaa was ceded from Denmark to Sweden by the Treaty of Brömsebro.</p><h2>Demise[edit]</h2><p>The downfall of the Danish colonial empire was caused by a lack of resources.[2] The empire was quickly eclipsed by those of France, Britain and the Netherlands. Eventually Denmark sold its colonies in India to Britain.[2]</p><h2>Legacy[edit]</h2><p>Greenland and the Faroe Islands are the last vestiges of the colonial empire. Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953, and it became an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It gained home rule in 1979 and further autonomy, including self-determination, in 2009. Likewise, the Faroes were incorporated into the Kingdom in the eighteenth century, with the status of a county, and then given home rule in 1948.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

				This article is about the Eskimo–Aleut language. For the extinct North Germanic language, see Greenlandic Norse.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 57,000 Greenlandic Inuit in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut. The main variety, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the Naalakkersuisut (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, Danish. The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic. The Thule Inuit of Greenland, Inuktun or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut.</p><p>Greenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (subject) of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (subject) of a transitive verb.</p><p>Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in transitive clauses is subject–object–verb. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables switch-reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as yesterday or now or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.</p><p>When adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the Thule people in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland.</p><p>The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.[4]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg/350px-Inuktitut_dialect_map.svg.png" width="350" height="313"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.</p><p>From the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at replacing Greenlandic with Danish. Of primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.[5]</p><p>From 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.[5]</p><p>Another development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of greenlandization of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.[6] Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic. The newspaper Sermitsiaq, has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten, which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.[7][8]</p><p>Before June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish.[note 1] Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language.[2] This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an indigenous language of the Americas that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi-independent country. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be in a vulnerable state by the UNESCO Red Book of Language Endangerment.[9] The country has a 100% literacy rate.[10] As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant, a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect.[11]</p><h2>Classification[edit]</h2><p>Kalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the Eskimo–Aleut family and are closely related to the Inuit languages of Canada and Alaska. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.</p><p>The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut), which is the official language of Greenland. The name Kalaallisut is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, Inuktun (Avanersuarmiutut), spoken in the vicinity of the city of Qaanaaq (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect (Tunumiit oraasiat), spoken in the vicinity of Ammassalik Island and Ittoqqortoormiit, is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.[14] Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around Upernavik has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of Uummannaq and the Disko Bay. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in Sisimiut in the north, around Nuuk and as far south as Maniitsoq. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around Narsaq and Qaqortoq in the south.[4] Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for humans in the three main dialects. It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, maintaining the gh which has been elided in Kalaallisut, and Tunumiisut is the most innovative, having further simplified the structure by eliding the /n/.</p><p>Michael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argues for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and the Eskimo–Aleut languages in Language Relations Across Bering Strait (1998). He calls this proposed grouping the Uralo-Siberian languages.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Phonology[edit]</h2><p>See also: Inuit phonology</p><p>Letters between slashes / / indicate phonemic transcription, letters in square brackets [ ] indicate phonetic transcription and letters in triangular brackets ? ? indicate standard Greenlandic orthography.</p><h3>Vowels[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg/250px-West_Greenlandic_vowel_chart.svg.png" width="250" height="210"><br><p>Ranges of West Greenlandic monophthongs on a vowel chart.[15]</p><p>The Greenlandic three vowel system, composed of /i/, /u/, and /a/, is typical for an Eskimo–Aleut language. Double vowels are analyzed as two morae, so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.[16][17] The only diphthong in the language is /ai/, which occurs only at the ends of words.[18] Before a uvular consonant ([q] or [?]), /i/ is realized allophonically as [e], [?] or [?], and /u/ is realized allophonically as [o] or [?], and the two vowels are written e, o respectively (as in some orthographies used for Quechua and Aymara).[19] /a/ becomes retracted to [?] in the same environment. /i/ is rounded to [y] before labial consonants.[19] /u/ is fronted to [?] between two coronal consonants.[19]</p><p>The allophonic lowering of /i/ and /u/ before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing /i/ and /u/ as ?e? and ?o? respectively before uvulars ?q? and ?r?. For example:</p><p>/ui/ "husband" pronounced [ui].
/uiqarpuq/ "she has a husband" pronounced [ueq??p?q] and written ?ueqarpoq?.


/illu/ "house" pronounced [i??u].
/illuqarpuq/ "he has a house" pronounced [i??oq??p?q] and written ?illoqarpoq?.</p><h3>Consonants[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic has consonants at five points of articulation: labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular. It does not have phonemic voicing contrast, but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.[note 2] The earlier palatal sibilant [?] has merged with [s] in all but a few dialects.[20] The labiodental fricative [f] is only contrastive in loanwords. The alveolar stop [t] is pronounced as an affricate [t?s] before the high front vowel /i/. Often, Danish loanwords containing ?b d g? preserve these, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example ?baaja? [pa?ja] beer and ?Guuti? [ku?t?i] God; these are pronounced exactly as /p t k/.[4]</p><h3>Phonological constraints[edit]</h3><p>The Kalaallisut syllable is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word-final /ai/.[21] Native words may only begin with a vowel or /p, t, k, q, s, m, n/; they may end only in /p, t, k, q/ or rarely /n/. Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.[22]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Prosody[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic prosody does not include stress as an autonomous category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters.[17] Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.[23]</p><p>Geminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.[24]</p><p>Intonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.[23][25]</p><h3>Morphophonology[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.</p><p>Greenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is /?/. The first consonant in a cluster is always assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate /tt/ is pronounced [ts] and written ?ts?. Geminate /ll/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [ç?] but is written ?gg?. Geminate /??/ is pronounced [??]. Geminate /vv/ is pronounced [f?] and written ?ff?. /v/ is also pronounced and written [f] after /?/.[26]</p><p>These assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, iglu (house), is illu in Greenlandic, where the /gl/ consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. And the word Inuktitut itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes Inuttut. The Old Greenlandic diphthong /au/ has assimilated to /aa/.</p><p>The consonant /v/ has disappeared when between /u/ and /i/ or /a/. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without [v] when suffixed to stems ending in /u/.</p><p>The vowel /i/ of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo–Aleut vowels *i and *?. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.[27] In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned morphophonologically in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *? has the variant [a] when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.[28]</p><p>The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, Inuktun, which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (Tunumiit oraasiat) has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. [??] to [t?]. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is Ittoqqortoormiit, which would appear as Illoqqortoormiut in Kalaallisut.[13][14]</p><h2>Grammar[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg/350px-Parkverbot_Gr%C3%B6nland.jpg" width="350" height="263"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to "parking forbidden for all vehicles".</p><p>The morphology of Greenlandic is highly synthetic and exclusively suffixing,[29] with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.[note 5] In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.[30][note 6] The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.[31]</p><p>There are few compound words, but lots of derivations.[32] The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.</p><p>The language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.[33]</p><p>In this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.</p><h3>Syntax[edit]</h3><p>Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.[34]</p><p>The verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.[34] The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:</p><p>Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:</p><p>Sini-ppoq "(S)he sleeps"
sleep-3p/IND[note 8]</p><p>Intransitive clause with subject noun phrase:</p><p>Angut sinippoq "the man sleeps"

woman.ABS love-3p/3p

Morphosyntactic alignment[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic language uses case to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.[35]</p><p>Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, instead of treating the grammatical relations as in most European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.[36] Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.[37]</p><p>Intransitive:</p><p>Anda sini-ppoq "Anda sleeps"
Anda.ABS sleep-3p/IND</p><p>Transitive with agent and object:</p><p>Anda-p nanoq taku-aa "Anda sees a bear"
Anda.ERG bear-ABS see-3p/3p

Word order[edit]</p><p>In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is AOXV / SXV, where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. Topical noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a focal subject or object as well. In spoken language also afterthought material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.[38]</p><p>On the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.[39]</p><p>In copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa "Anda bought the sweater"
Anda sweater bought
A O V</p><p>An attribute appears after its head noun.</p><p>Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa "Anda bought the blue sweater"
Anda sweater blue bought
A O X V</p><p>An attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:</p><p>Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq "Anda is a skilled carpenter"
Anda carpenter.IS skilled
S V APP

Coordination and Subordination[edit]</p><p>Syntactic coordination and subordination is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.[40] The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.[41]</p><p>Obviation and switch-reference[edit]</p><p>The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as obviation[42] or switch-reference.[43] There is a special so-called fourth person[44] used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.[45] Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>illu-a taku-aa "he saw his (the other man's) house"

Indefiniteness construction[edit]</p><p>There is no category of definiteness in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors, morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive[46][47] or intransitive object[48] conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.[49][50] This view, however, is controversial.[51]</p><p>Active:</p><p>Piitap arfeq takuaa "Peter saw the whale"
Peter-ERG whale see</p><p>Antipassive/intransitive object:</p><p>Piitaq arfermik takuvoq "Peter saw (a) whale"
Peter-ABS whale-INSTR see</p><h3>Verbs[edit]</h3><p>The morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are inflection and derivation. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and voice (tense/aspect is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).[52][53][54] Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by adverbs in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as postbases rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.[55] Such semantically heavy suffixes may express concepts such as to have, to be, to say, or to think. The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.</p><p>Inflection[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.[56] The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.[57]</p><p>Indicative and interrogative moods[edit]</p><p>The indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing questions. Questions with the question particle immaqa maybe cannot use the interrogative mood.[58]</p><p>napparsima-vit? "Are you sick?"

The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Interestingly, consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to pp in the 3rd person plural and weakening to v elsewhere).</p><p>Table 6 shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb asa- to love (an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection).</p><p>Imperative and Optative moods[edit]</p><p>The imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.[59]</p><p>sini-git! "Sleep!"

Causative mood[edit]</p><p>The causative mood (sometimes called the conjunctive) is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning because, since or when; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of that.

Contemporative mood[edit]</p><p>The contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.[62]</p><p>qasu-llunga angerlar-punga "Being tired, I went home"

Derivation[edit]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Verbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes.

Time reference and aspect[edit]</p><p>Greenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,[64] and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of tense markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:[65]</p><p>toqo-riikatap-poq "He died long ago"[66]
die-long.ago-3p/IND
nere-qqammer-punga "I ate recently"[66]
eat-recently-I/IND
ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq "Yesterday Peter was running."[67]
yesterday Peter-ABS run-3p/IND</p><p>All other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal aktionsart.[67]</p><p>Piitaq arpap-poq "Peter runs"[67]
Peter-ABS run-3p/IND
Piitaq ani-voq "Peter was gone out"[67]
Peter-ABS go.out-3p/IND</p><p>But if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.[68]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Greenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. sar expressing habituality and ssaar expressing stop to.[69] Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: sima and nikuu. sima can occur in several positions with obviously different function[70] Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.</p><p>tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq "Apparently, she had arrived"[71]
arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/INT</p><p>With atelic verbs, there is a regular contrast between indirective evidentiality marked by sima and witnessed evidentiality marked by nikuu.[72] Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and sima sometimes is marked.[73]</p><p>qia-sima-voq "He cried (his eyes are swollen)"

qia-nikuu-voq "He cried (I was there)"
cry-NIKUU-3p/IND[72]</p><p>In the written language[66] and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.[74] That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.</p><p>Just as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:</p><p>e.g. Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu "I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer."

expect-I/3p/IND summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p

e.g. Qimmi-t nirukkar-niar-nigik "Let us feed the dogs, ok?"[76]

dog-PL feed-please-we/them/IMP</p><p>While the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.[77][78] However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.[79]</p><p>Noun incorporation[edit]</p><p>There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.[47][80][81][82][83][84] This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.[85] Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.[86][87][88] The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>qimmeq dog + -qar- have (+ -poq 3p)</p><p>qimme-qar-poq "She has a dog"</p><p>illu house + -'lior- make</p><p>illu-lior-poq "She builds a house"</p><p>kaffi coffee + -sor- drink/eat</p><p>kaffi-sor-poq "She drinks coffee"</p><p>puisi seal + -nniar- hunt</p><p>puisi-nniar-poq "She hunts seal"</p><p>allagaq letter + -si- receive</p><p>allagar-si-voq "She has received a letter"</p><p>anaana mother + -a- to be</p><p>anaana-a-voq "She is a mother"</p><h3>Nouns[edit]</h3><p>Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.[89] Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. atuar- to read + -fik place becomes atuarfik school and atuarfik + -tsialak something good becomes atuarfitsialak good school.</p><p>The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.[90][note 10]</p><p>Pronouns[edit]</p><p>There are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.[91]</p><p>Personal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:</p><p>ilin-nut niri-qu-aa
thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.
'He told you to eat it'

Case[edit]</p><p>The two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.</p><p>angu-t neri-voq "The man eats"

Possession[edit]</p><p>In Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.[97] Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of illu house. Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.</p><p>Anda-p illu-a "Anda's house"

Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word palasi priest is a loan from the Danish præst. But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. qarasaasiaq computer which literally means artificial brain. This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.[4] For example the root for tongue oqaq is used to derive the following words:</p><p>Lexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.[4]</p><h2>Orthography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG/220px-%C4%B8ra_in_a_dictionary_%28ubt%29.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>? in a Greenlandic–Danish dictionary from 1926</p><p>Greenlandic is written with the Latin script. The alphabet:</p><p>A E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V</p><p>To spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters B, C, D, X, Y, Z, W, Æ, Ø and Å are used.[98][99] Greenlandic uses the symbols ... and&nbsp;»...«&nbsp;as quotation marks.</p><p>From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt. This alphabet employed the special character kra (?' / ?) which was replaced by q in the 1973 reform.[100] In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name Kalaallit Nunaat was spelled Kalâdlit Nunât. This scheme uses a circumflex accent ( ˆ ) to indicate a long vowel (e.g., ât/ît/ût, modern: aat, iit, uut), an acute accent ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e., á, í, ú modern: a(kk), i(kk), u(kk))] and, finally, a tilde ( ˜ ) or a grave accent ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g., ãt, it, ut or àt, ìt, ùt, modern: aatt, iitt, uutt). The letters ê and ô, used only before r and q, are now written ee and oo in Greenlandic. The spelling system of Nunatsiavummiutut, spoken in Nunatsiavut in northeastern Labrador, is derived from the old Greenlandic system.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)[101] whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.</p><h3>Sample text[edit]</h3><p>Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik.

				For other people with the same name, see Margaret of Denmark (disambiguation).</p><p>Margrethe II (Danish: Margrethe 2., pronounced&nbsp;[m?'g?æ??d?]; Faroese: Margreta 2.; Greenlandic: Margrethe II; full name: Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid; born 16 April 1940) is the Queen of Denmark. She is also the supreme authority of the Church of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defence Forces. Born into the House of Glücksburg, a royal house with origins in Northern Germany, she was the eldest child of Frederick IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden. She succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972, having had become heir presumptive to her father in 1953, when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. On her accession, Margrethe became the first female monarch of Denmark since Margaret I, ruler of the Scandinavian countries in 1375–1412 during the Kalmar Union. In 1967, she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, with whom she has two sons: Crown Prince Frederik (born 1968) and Prince Joachim (born 1969). She has been on the Danish throne for 45 years, becoming the second longest-reigning Danish monarch after her ancestor Christian IV.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early life[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Amalienborg_cph.jpg/220px-Amalienborg_cph.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg, photographed in 2006</p><p>Princess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as the first child of Crown Prince Frederick, later King Frederick IX and Crown Princess Ingrid, later Queen Ingrid. Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, later King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, and Crown Princess Margaret, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Her birth took place just one week after Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940.[2]</p><p>She was baptised on 14 May in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen.[2] The Princess's godparents were: King Christian X (paternal grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V of Sweden (maternal great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (maternal grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (her maternal uncle); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (maternal grandmother's father).</p><p>She was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, Queen Alexandrine, and Ingrid after her mother, Crown Princess Ingrid. Since her paternal grandfather was also the King of Iceland, she was given an Icelandic name, Þórhildur (Thorhildur).[3]</p><p>When Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her first sister, Princess Benedikte, was born. Princess Benedikte later married Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister Princess Anne Marie was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married Constantine II of Greece and now lives in Greece.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Margrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at Gråsten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.</p><h2>Heir presumptive[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg/220px-Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_1966.jpg" width="220" height="270"><br><p>Princess Margrethe in 1966.</p><p>At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the Glücksburg branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle Prince Knud would one day assume the throne.</p><p>The process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new Act of Succession permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive.[2]</p><p>On her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the Council of State. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.[2]</p><p>In 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to Los Angeles, and to the Paramount Studios, where they were met by several celebrities, including Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley.[4]</p><h3>Education[edit]</h3><p>Margrethe was educated at the private school N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen from which she graduated in 1959. She spent a year at North Foreland Lodge, a boarding school for girls in Hampshire, England,[5] and later studied prehistoric archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge, during 1960–1961, political science at Aarhus University between 1961 and 1962, attended the Sorbonne in 1963, and was at the London School of Economics in 1965.[6] She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.[2]</p><p>Queen Margrethe is fluent in Danish, French, English, Swedish and German, and has a limited knowledge of Faroese.[2][6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Marriage and children[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg/220px-Royal_Wedding_Stockholm_2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Queen Margrethe II and her consort, Prince Henrik, in 2010.</p><p>Princess Margrethe married a French diplomat, Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, 10 June 1967, at the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen.

By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son Frederik.

Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style By the Grace of God, Queen of Denmark (Danish: Margrethe den Anden, af Guds Nåde Danmarks Dronning). The Queen chose the motto: God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.[6]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said:</p><p>My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.[7]</p><h3>Constitutional role[edit]</h3><p>The Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc.</p><p>As an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.[2]</p><p>After an election where the incumbent Prime Minister does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a “Dronningerunde” (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the Danish political parties.[8]</p><p>Each party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal Det Radikale Venstre did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the Folketing, is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history that any party has held a majority on its own.)</p><p>Once the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State (privy council), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the Cabinet of Denmark.</p><p>In addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the Colonel-in-Chief of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires), an infantry regiment of the British Army, following a tradition in her family.[2]</p><h3>Ruby Jubilee[edit]</h3><p>Queen Margrethe II celebrated her Ruby Jubilee, the 40th year on the throne, 14 January 2012.[9] This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace and numerous TV interviews.</p><h3>Immigration debate[edit]</h3><p>In 2016 an interview within the book De dybeste rødder (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo instituttet, a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.[10][11]</p><h2>Personal life and interests[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The official residences of the Queen and the Prince Consort are Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen and Fredensborg Palace. Their summer residence is Gråsten Palace near Sønderborg, the former home of the Queen's mother, Queen Ingrid, who died in 2000.</p><p>Margrethe is an accomplished painter, and has held many art shows over the years. Her illustrations—under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer—were used for the Danish edition of The Lord of the Rings, which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to J. R. R. Tolkien who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's poetry collection Cantabile. She is also an accomplished translator and is said to have participated in the Danish translation of The Lord of the Rings.[6] Another skill she possesses is costume designing, having designed the costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet's production of A Folk Tale and for the 2009 Peter Flinth film, De vilde svaner (The Wild Swans).[2][12] She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices. Margrethe also wears designs by former Pierre Balmain designer Erik Mortensen, Jørgen Bender, and Birgitte Taulow.[13] The Guardian in March 2013 listed her as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s.[14]</p><p>Margrethe is a chain smoker, and she is famous for her tobacco habit.[15] However, on 23 November 2006, the Danish newspaper B.T. reported an announcement from the Royal Court stating that in future the Queen would smoke only in private.[16]</p><p>A statement in a 2005 authorized biography about the Queen (entitled Margrethe) focused on her views of Islam: We are being challenged by Islam these years. Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction.[17]</p><p>Queen Margrethe II visited the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, in Nanjing, April 27, 2014. The Queen said the Memorial Hall records the darkest part of history in 77 years. We cannot change the cruel history, but can learn a historic lesson and experience from it. Today, we commemorate Sindberg. We need not only to review the past, but also need to face up to the future, she said. Margrethe II and Prince Henrik watered a tree symbolizing peace, on the square outside the Memorial Hall. They also laid down a yellow rose, named by Sindberg’s hometown as Forever Nanjing, Sindberg Yellow Rose in 2004.</p><h2>Family[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Danish Royal Family</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg/220px-Monarchy_Of_Denmark_April_2010.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Her Majesty surrounded by her family waving to crowds on her 70th birthday in April 2010.
