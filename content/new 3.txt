			The President of the Royal Society is head of both the society and the council. The details for the presidency were set out in the second charter and initially had no limit on how long a president could serve for; under current society statute, the term is five years.[55]</p><p>The current president is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, who took over from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015.[56] Historically, the duties of the president have been both formal and social. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president as one of the few individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.[57]</p><h3>Permanent staff</h3><p>The society is assisted by a number of full-time paid staff. The original charter provided for two or more Operators of Experiments, and two or more clerks; as the number of books in the society's collection grew, it also became necessary to employ a curator.

			The Society has a variety of functions and activities. It supports modern science by disbursing nearly £42&nbsp;million to fund approximately 600 research fellowships for both early and late career scientists, along with innovation, mobility and research capacity grants.[60] Its Awards, prize lectures and medals all come with prize money intended to finance research,[61] and it provides subsidised communications and media skills courses for research scientists.[62] Much of this activity is supported by a grant from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, most of which is channelled to the University Research Fellowships (URF).[32] In 2008, the Society opened the Royal Society Enterprise Fund, intended to invest in new scientific companies and be self-sustaining, funded (after an initial set of donations on the 350th anniversary of the Society) by the returns from its investments.[63]</p><p>Through its Science Policy Centre, the Society acts as an advisor to the European Commission and the United Nations on matters of science. It publishes several reports a year, and serves as the Academy of Sciences of the United Kingdom.[64] Since the middle of the 18th century, government problems involving science were irregularly referred to the Society, and by 1800 it was done regularly.[65]</p><h2>Carlton House Terrace</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Royal_Society_20040420.jpg/220px-Royal_Society_20040420.jpg" width="220" height="153"><p>

		</p><p>
			The premises at 6–9 Carlton House Terrace is a Grade I listed building and the current headquarters of the Royal Society, which had moved there from Burlington House in 1967.[66] The ground floor and basement are used for ceremonies, social and publicity events, the first floor hosts facilities for Fellows and Officers of the Society, and the second and third floors are divided between offices and accommodation for the President, Executive Secretary and Fellows.[67]</p><p>The first Carlton House was named after Baron Carleton, and was sold to Lord Chesterfield in 1732, who held it on trust for Frederick, Prince of Wales. Frederick held his court there until his death in 1751, after which it was occupied by his widow until her death in 1772. In 1783, the then-Prince of Wales George bought the house, instructing his architect Henry Holland to completely remodel it.</p><p>When George became King, he authorised the demolition of Carlton House, with the request that the replacement be a residential area. John Nash eventually completed a design that saw Carlton House turned into two blocks of houses, with a space in between them.[68] The building is still owned by the Crown Estates and leased by the Society; it underwent a major renovation from 2001 to 2004 at the cost of £9.8&nbsp;million, and was reopened by the Prince of Wales on 7 July 2004.[8]</p><p>Carlton House Terrace underwent a series of renovations between 1999 and November 2003 to improve and standardise the property. New waiting, exhibition and reception rooms were created in the house at No.7, using the Magna Boschi marble found in No.8, and greenish grey Statuario Venato marble was used in other areas to standardise the design.[67] An effort was also made to make the layout of the buildings easier, consolidating all the offices on one floor, Fellows' Rooms on another and all the accommodation on a third.[69]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Kavli Royal Society International Centre</h2><p>In 2009 Chicheley Hall, a Grade I listed building located near Milton Keynes, was bought by the Royal Society for £6.5&nbsp;million, funded in part by the Kavli Foundation.[70] The Royal Society spent several million on renovations adapting it to become the Kavli Royal Society International Centre, a venue for residential science seminars.

		The electromagnetic waves that compose electromagnetic radiation can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This diagram shows a plane linearly polarized EMR wave propagating from left to right (X axis). The electric field is in a vertical plane (Z axis) and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane (Y axis). The electric and magnetic fields in EMR waves are always in phase and at 90 degrees to each other.

			In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) refers to the waves (or their quanta, photons) of the electromagnetic field, propagating (radiating) through space carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-, and gamma radiation.</p><p>Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum. The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. The wavefront of electromagnetic waves emitted from a point source (such as a lightbulb) is a sphere. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum could be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength. The electromagnetic spectrum includes, in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.[1]</p><p>Electromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are accelerated, and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles. EM waves carry energy, momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact. Quanta of EM waves are called photons, whose rest mass is zero, but whose energy, or equivalent total (relativistic) mass, is not zero so they are still affected by gravity. Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (radiate) without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this language, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically, electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena.</p><p>In the quantum theory of electromagnetism, EMR consists of photons, the elementary particles responsible for all electromagnetic interactions. Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation. The energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by Planck's equation E = h?, where E is the energy per photon, ? is the frequency of the photon, and h is Planck's constant. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called non-ionizing radiation, because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ionizing radiation since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. These radiations have the ability to cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Physics</h2><h3>Theory</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/VisibleEmrWavelengths.svg/220px-VisibleEmrWavelengths.svg.png" width="220" height="202"><p>

			 Main articles: Maxwell's equations and Near and far field</p><p>Maxwell derived a wave form of the electric and magnetic equations, thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured speed of light, Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave. Maxwell’s equations were confirmed by Heinrich Hertz through experiments with radio waves.</p><p>According to Maxwell's equations, a spatially varying electric field is always associated with a magnetic field that changes over time. Likewise, a spatially varying magnetic field is associated with specific changes over time in the electric field. In an electromagnetic wave, the changes in the electric field are always accompanied by a wave in the magnetic field in one direction, and vice versa. This relationship between the two occurs without either type field causing the other; rather, they occur together in the same way that time and space changes occur together and are interlinked in special relativity. In fact, magnetic fields may be viewed as relativistic distortions of electric fields, so the close relationship between space and time changes here is more than an analogy. Together, these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave, which moves out into space and need never again affect the source. The distant EM field formed in this way by the acceleration of a charge carries energy with it that radiates away through space, hence the term.</p><p> Main articles: Near and far field and Liénard–Wiechert potential</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg/300px-FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg.png" width="300" height="160"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		In electromagnetic radiation (such as microwaves from an antenna, shown here) the term applies only to the parts of the electromagnetic field that radiate into infinite space and decrease in intensity by an inverse-square law of power, so that the total radiation energy that crosses through an imaginary spherical surface is the same, no matter how far away from the antenna the spherical surface is drawn. Electromagnetic radiation thus includes the far field part of the electromagnetic field around a transmitter. A part of the "near-field" close to the transmitter, forms part of the changing electromagnetic field, but does not count as electromagnetic radiation.


		</p><p>
			Maxwell's equations established that some charges and currents (sources) produce a local type of electromagnetic field near them that does not have the behaviour of EMR. Currents directly produce a magnetic field, but it is of a magnetic dipole type that dies out with distance from the current. In a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an electric dipole type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields make up the near-field near the EMR source. Neither of these behaviours are responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they cause electromagnetic field behaviour that only efficiently transfers power to a receiver very close to the source, such as the magnetic induction inside a transformer, or the feedback behaviour that happens close to the coil of a metal detector. Typically, near-fields have a powerful effect on their own sources, causing an increased “load” (decreased electrical reactance) in the source or transmitter, whenever energy is withdrawn from the EM field by a receiver. Otherwise, these fields do not “propagate” freely out into space, carrying their energy away without distance-limit, but rather oscillate, returning their energy to the transmitter if it is not received by a receiver.[citation needed]</p><p>By contrast, the EM far-field is composed of radiation that is free of the transmitter in the sense that (unlike the case in an electrical transformer) the transmitter requires the same power to send these changes in the fields out, whether the signal is immediately picked up or not. This distant part of the electromagnetic field is electromagnetic radiation (also called the far-field). The far-fields propagate (radiate) without allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver. Because such waves conserve the amount of energy they transmit through any spherical boundary surface drawn around their source, and because such surfaces have an area that is defined by the square of the distance from the source, the power of EM radiation always varies according to an inverse-square law. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM field close to the source (the near-field), which varies in power according to an inverse cube power law, and thus does not transport a conserved amount of energy over distances, but instead fades with distance, with its energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil).[citation needed]</p><p>The far-field (EMR) depends on a different mechanism for its production than the near-field, and upon different terms in Maxwell’s equations. Whereas the magnetic part of the near-field is due to currents in the source, the magnetic field in EMR is due only to the local change in the electric field. In a similar way, while the electric field in the near-field is due directly to the charges and charge-separation in the source, the electric field in EMR is due to a change in the local magnetic field. Both processes for producing electric and magnetic EMR fields have a different dependence on distance than do near-field dipole electric and magnetic fields. That is why the EMR type of EM field becomes dominant in power “far” from sources. The term “far from sources” refers to how far from the source (moving at the speed of light) any portion of the outward-moving EM field is located, by the time that source currents are changed by the varying source potential, and the source has therefore begun to generate an outwardly moving EM field of a different phase.[citation needed]</p><p>A more compact view of EMR is that the far-field that composes EMR is generally that part of the EM field that has traveled sufficient distance from the source, that it has become completely disconnected from any feedback to the charges and currents that were originally responsible for it. Now independent of the source charges, the EM field, as it moves farther away, is dependent only upon the accelerations of the charges that produced it. It no longer has a strong connection to the direct fields of the charges, or to the velocity of the charges (currents).[citation needed]</p><p>In the Liénard–Wiechert potential formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell's equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle's uniform velocity, are both associated with the electromagnetic near-field, and do not comprise EM radiation.[citation needed]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Properties</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Electromagneticwave3Dfromside.gif/220px-Electromagneticwave3Dfromside.gif" width="220" height="219"><p>

			Electrodynamics is the physics of electromagnetic radiation, and electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For example, in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual lightwaves.[citation needed]</p><p>Since light is an oscillation it is not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum. However, in nonlinear media, such as some crystals, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields — these interactions include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect.[2][3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by Snell's law. Light of composite wavelengths (natural sunlight) disperses into a visible spectrum passing through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of the prism material (dispersion); that is, each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount.[citation needed]</p><p>EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the same time (see wave-particle duality). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. It is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not evidence of particulate behavior. Rather, it reflects the quantum nature of matter.[4] Demonstrating that the light itself is quantized, not merely its interaction with matter, is a more subtle affair.</p><p>Some experiments display both the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves, such as the self-interference of a single photon.[5] When a single photon is sent through an interferometer, it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once.</p><p>A quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics.</p><p>Electromagnetic waves can be polarized, reflected, refracted, diffracted or interfere with each other.</p><h3>Wave model</h3><p>Electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave, meaning that its oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and travel. The electric and magnetic parts of the field stand in a fixed ratio of strengths in order to satisfy the two Maxwell equations that specify how one is produced from the other. These E and B fields are also in phase, with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see illustrations). A common misconception is that the E and B fields in electromagnetic radiation are out of phase because a change in one produces the other, and this would produce a phase difference between them as sinusoidal functions (as indeed happens in electromagnetic induction, and in the near-field close to antennas). However, in the far-field EM radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell curl operator equations, a more correct description is that a time-change in one type of field is proportional to a space-change in the other. These derivatives require that the E and B fields in EMR are in-phase (see math section below).[citation needed]</p><p>An important aspect of light's nature is its frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz, the SI unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second. Light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon known as dispersion.</p><p>A wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:[citation needed]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinhole_camera&amp;oldid=784137968"

He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy&nbsp;I (323–283 BCE). His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.[1][2][3] In the Elements, Euclid deduced the principles of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. Euclid also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and rigor.</p><p>Euclid is the anglicized version of the Greek name ????e?d??, which means renowned, glorious.[4]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Life</h2><p>Very few original references to Euclid survive, so little is known about his life. The date, place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other people mentioned with him. He is rarely mentioned by name by other Greek mathematicians from Archimedes (c.?287 BC – c.?212 BC) onward, and is usually referred to as ? st???e??t?? (the author of Elements).[5] The few historical references to Euclid were written centuries after he lived by Proclus c. 450 AD and Pappus of Alexandria c. 320 AD.[6]</p><p>Proclus introduces Euclid only briefly in his Commentary on the Elements. According to Proclus, Euclid belonged to Plato's persuasion and brought together the Elements, drawing on prior work by several pupils of Plato (particularly Eudoxus of Cnidus, Theaetetus and Philip of Opus.) Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of Ptolemy I because he was mentioned by Archimedes (287–212&nbsp;BC). Although the apparent citation of Euclid by Archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works, it is still believed that Euclid wrote his works before those of Archimedes.[7][8][9]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Euclidis_quae_supersunt_omnia.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Euclidis_quae_supersunt_omnia.tif.jpg" width="220" height="326"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			Proclus later retells a story that, when Ptolemy I asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than Euclid's Elements, Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry.[10] This anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about Menaechmus and Alexander the Great.[11]</p><p>In the only other key reference to Euclid, Pappus briefly mentioned in the fourth century that Apollonius spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid at Alexandria, and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought c. 247–222&nbsp;BC.[12][13]</p><p>A detailed biography of Euclid is given by Arabian authors, mentioning, for example, a birth town of Tyre. This biography is generally believed to be completely fictitious.[8]</p><p>Because the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies are available for most significant Greek mathematicians for several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not, in fact, a historical character and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name Euclid from the historical character Euclid of Megara (compare Bourbaki). However, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor.[8][14]</p><h2>Elements</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/P._Oxy._I_29.jpg/250px-P._Oxy._I_29.jpg" width="250" height="152"><p>

			 Main article: Euclid's Elements</p><p>Although many of the results in Elements originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later.[16]</p><p>There is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the Elements, and most of the copies say they are from the edition of Theon or the lectures of Theon,[17] while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the Elements was from Proclus, who briefly in his Commentary on the Elements ascribes Euclid as its author.</p><p>Although best known for its geometric results, the Elements also includes number theory. It considers the connection between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (known as the Euclid–Euler theorem), the infinitude of prime numbers, Euclid's lemma on factorization (which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic on uniqueness of prime factorizations), and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.</p><p>The geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible.

With Isidore of Miletus, he designed the Hagia Sophia for Justinian&nbsp;I. </p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Life</h2><p>Anthemius was one of the five sons of Stephanus of Tralles, a physician. His brothers were Dioscorus, Alexander, Olympius, and Metrodorus. Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander did so in Rome and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius became a noted lawyer; and Metrodorus worked as a grammarian in Constantinople.[2]</p><p>Anthemius was said to have annoyed his neighbor Zeno in two ways: first, by engineering a miniature earthquake by sending steam through leather tubes he had fixed among the joists and flooring of Zeno's parlor while he was entertaining friends and, second, by simulating thunder and lightning and flashing intolerable light into Zeno's eyes from a slightly hollowed mirror.[2] In addition to his familiarity with steam, some dubious authorities credited Anthemius with a knowledge of gunpowder or other explosive compound.[2]</p><h2>Mathematics</h2><p>Anthemius was a capable mathematician. In the course of his treatise On Burning Glasses, intended to facilitate the construction of surfaces to reflect light to a single point, he described the string construction of the ellipse[1] and assumed a property of ellipses not found in Apollonius of Perga's Conics: the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point. His work also includes the first practical use of the directrix: having given the focus and a double ordinate, he used the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a parabola.[2] This work was later known to Arab mathematicians such as Alhazen.</p><p>Eutocius's commentary on Apollonius's Conics was dedicated to Anthemius.[1]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Hagia_Sophia_Mars_2013.jpg/120px-Hagia_Sophia_Mars_2013.jpg" width="120" height="80"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

		Instructions for making astronomical instruments from the time of the Qing Dynasty.


		</p><p>
			Ancient Han Chinese scientists, engineers, astronomers, philosophers, mathematicians and medical doctors made significant innovations, scientific discoveries and technological advances in science, technology, engineering, medicine, military technology, mathematics, geology and astronomy.</p><p>Among the earliest inventions were the abacus, the shadow clock, and the first items such as Kongming lanterns.[1] The Four Great Inventions: the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing, were among the most important technological advances, only known to Europe by the end of the Middle Ages 1000 years later. The Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 906) in particular, was a time of great innovation.[1] A good deal of exchange occurred between Western and Chinese discoveries up to the Qing Dynasty.</p><p>The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China, and knowledge of Chinese technology was brought to Europe.[2][3] In the 19th and 20th century the introduction of Western technology was a major factor in the modernization of China. Much of the early Western work in the history of science in China was done by Joseph Needham.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Mo Di and the School of Names</h2><p>The Warring States period began 2500 years ago at the time of the invention of the crossbow.[4] Needham notes that the invention of the crossbow far outstripped the progress in defensive armor, which made the wearing of armor useless to the princes and dukes of the states.[5] At this time, there were also many nascent schools of thought in China — the Hundred Schools of Thought (????), scattered among many polities. The schools served as communities which advised the rulers of these states. Mo Di (?? Mozi, 470 BCE–ca. 391 BCE) introduced concepts useful to one of those rulers, such as defensive fortification. One of these concepts, fa (? principle or method)[6] was extended by the School of Names (?? Ming jia, ming=name), which began a systematic exploration of logic. The development of a school of logic was cut short by the defeat of Mohism's political sponsors by the Qin Dynasty, and the subsumption of fa as law rather than method by the Legalists (?? Fa jia).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Needham further notes that the Han Dynasty, which conquered the short-lived Qin, were made aware of the need for law by Lu Chia and by Shu-Sun Thung, as defined by the scholars, rather than the generals.[5]</p><p>You conquered the empire on horseback, but from horseback you will never succeed in ruling it.</p><p>Derived from Taoist philosophy, one of the newest longstanding contributions of the ancient Chinese are in Traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture and herbal medicine. The practice of acupuncture can be traced back as far as the 1st millennium BC and some scientists believe that there is evidence that practices similar to acupuncture were used in Eurasia during the early Bronze Age.[8]</p><p>Using shadow clocks and the abacus (both invented in the ancient Near East before spreading to China), the Chinese were able to record observations, documenting the first recorded solar eclipse in 2137 BC, and making the first recording of any planetary grouping in 500 BC.[9] These claims, however, are highly disputed and rely on much supposition.[10][11] The Book of Silk was the first definitive atlas of comets, written c.400 BC. It listed 29 comets (referred to as sweeping stars) that appeared over a period of about 300 years, with renderings of comets describing an event its appearance corresponded to.[9]</p><p>In architecture, the pinnacle of Chinese technology manifested itself in the Great Wall of China, under the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang between 220 and 200 BC. Typical Chinese architecture changed little from the succeeding Han Dynasty until the 19th century.[12] The Qin Dynasty also developed the crossbow, which later became the mainstream weapon in Europe. Several remains of crossbows have been found among the soldiers of the Terracotta Army in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang.[13]</p><h2>Han Dynasty</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/ChineseCrossbow.JPG/220px-ChineseCrossbow.JPG" width="220" height="285"><p>

			 Main article: Science and technology of the Han Dynasty</p><p>The Eastern Han Dynasty scholar and astronomer Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) invented the first water-powered rotating armillary sphere (the first armillary sphere having been invented by the Greek Eratosthenes), and catalogued 2500 stars and over 100 constellations. In 132, he invented the first seismological detector, called the Houfeng Didong Yi (Instrument for inquiring into the wind and the shaking of the earth).[14] According to the History of Later Han Dynasty (25-220 AD), this seismograph was an urn-like instrument, which would drop one of eight balls to indicate when and in which direction an earthquake had occurred.[14] On June 13, 2005, Chinese seismologists announced that they had created a replica of the instrument.[14]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c.200-265 AD) was another impressive figure from ancient China. Ma Jun improved the design of the silk loom,[15] designed mechanical chain pumps to irrigate palatial gardens,[15] and created a large and intricate mechanical puppet theatre for Emperor Ming of Wei, which was operated by a large hidden waterwheel.[16] However, Ma Jun's most impressive invention was the south-pointing chariot, a complex mechanical device that acted as a mechanical compass vehicle. It incorporated the use of a differential gear in order to apply equal amount of torque to wheels rotating at different speeds, a device that is found in all modern automobiles.[17]</p><p>Sliding calipers were invented in China almost 2,000 years ago.[1] The Chinese civilization was the earliest civilization to experiment successfully with aviation, with the kite and Kongming lantern (proto Hot air balloon) being the first flying machines.</p><h2>Four Great Inventions</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Jingangjing.jpg/220px-Jingangjing.jpg" width="220" height="154"><p>

			 Main article: Four Great Inventions</p><p>The Four Great Inventions (simplified Chinese: ????; traditional Chinese: ????; pinyin: sì dà famíng) are the compass, gunpowder, papermaking and printing. Paper and printing were developed first. Printing was recorded in China in the Tang Dynasty, although the earliest surviving examples of printed cloth patterns date to before 220.[18] Pin-pointing the development of the compass can be difficult: the magnetic attraction of a needle is attested by the Louen-heng, composed between AD 20 and 100,[19] although the first undisputed magnetized needles in Chinese literature appear in 1086.[20]</p><p>By AD 300, Ge Hong, an alchemist of the Jin Dynasty, conclusively recorded the chemical reactions caused when saltpetre, pine resin and charcoal were heated together, in Book of the Master of the Preservations of Solidarity.[21] Another early record of gunpowder, a Chinese book from c. 850 AD, indicates:</p><p>Some have heated together sulfur, realgar and saltpeter with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down.[22]</p><p>These four discoveries had an enormous impact on the development of Chinese civilization and a far-ranging global impact. Gunpowder, for example, spread to the Arabs in the 13th century and thence to Europe.[23] According to English philosopher Francis Bacon, writing in Novum Organum:</p><p>Printing, gunpowder and the compass: These three have changed the whole face and state of things throughout the world; the first in literature, the second in warfare, the third in navigation; whence have followed innumerable changes, in so much that no empire, no sect, no star seems to have exerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical discoveries.</p><p>One of the most important military treatises of all Chinese history was the Huo Long Jing written by Jiao Yu in the 14th century. For gunpowder weapons, it outlined the use of fire arrows and rockets, fire lances and firearms, land mines and naval mines, bombards and cannons, two stage rockets, along with different compositions of gunpowder, including 'magic gunpowder', 'poisonous gunpowder', and 'blinding and burning gunpowder' (refer to his article).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>For the 11th century invention of ceramic movable type printing by Bi Sheng (990-1051), it was enhanced by the wooden movable type of Wang Zhen in 1298 and the bronze metal movable type of Hua Sui in 1490.</p><h2>China's scientific revolution</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/WorldShips1460.jpg/220px-WorldShips1460.jpg" width="220" height="222"><p>

			Among the engineering accomplishments of early China were matches, dry docks, the double-action piston pump, cast iron, the iron plough, the horse collar, the multi-tube seed drill, the wheelbarrow, the suspension bridge, the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the raised-relief map, the propeller, the sluice gate, and the pound lock. The Tang Dynasty (618–906 AD) and Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) in particular was a time of great innovation.[1]</p><p>In the 7th century, book-printing was developed in China, Korea and Japan, using delicate hand-carved wooden blocks to print individual pages.[1] The 9th century Diamond Sutra is the earliest known printed document.[1] Movable type was also used in China for a time, but was abandoned because of the number of characters needed; it would not be until Johannes Gutenberg that the technique was reinvented in a suitable environment.[1]</p><p>In addition to gunpowder, the Chinese also developed improved delivery systems for the Byzantine weapon of Greek fire, Meng Huo You and Pen Huo Qi first used in China c. 900.[25] Chinese illustrations were more realistic than in Byzantine manuscripts,[25] and detailed accounts from 1044 recommending its use on city walls and ramparts show the brass container as fitted with a horizontal pump, and a nozzle of small diameter.[25] The records of a battle on the Yangtze near Nanjing in 975 offer an insight into the dangers of the weapon, as a change of wind direction blew the fire back onto the Song forces.[25]</p><h3>Song Dynasty</h3><p> Main article: Technology of the Song Dynasty</p><p>The Song Dynasty (960–1279) brought a new stability for China after a century of civil war, and started a new area of modernisation by encouraging examinations and meritocracy. The first Song Emperor created political institutions that allowed a great deal of freedom of discourse and thought, which facilitated the growth of scientific advance, economic reforms, and achievements in arts and literature.[26] Trade flourished both within China and overseas, and the encouragement of technology allowed the mints at Kaifeng and Hangzhou to gradually increase in production.[26] In 1080, the mints of Emperor Shenzong had produced 5 billion coins (roughly 50 per Chinese citizen), and the first banknotes were produced in 1023.[26] These coins were so durable that they would still be in use 700 years later, in the 18th century.[26]</p><p>There were many famous inventors and early scientists in the Song Dynasty period. The statesman Shen Kuo is best known for his book known as the Dream Pool Essays (1088 AD). In it, he wrote of use for a drydock to repair boats, the navigational magnetic compass, and the discovery of the concept of true north (with magnetic declination towards the North Pole). Shen Kuo also devised a geological theory for land formation, or geomorphology, and theorized that there was climate change in geological regions over an enormous span of time.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The equally talented statesman Su Song was best known for his engineering project of the Astronomical Clock Tower of Kaifeng, by 1088 AD. The clock tower was driven by a rotating waterwheel and escapement mechanism. Crowning the top of the clock tower was the large bronze, mechanically-driven, rotating armillary sphere. In 1070, Su Song also compiled the Ben Cao Tu Jing (Illustrated Pharmacopoeia, original source material from 1058–1061 AD) with a team of scholars. This pharmaceutical treatise covered a wide range of other related subjects, including botany, zoology, mineralogy, and metallurgy.</p><p>Chinese astronomers were the first to record observations of a supernova, the first being the SN 185, recorded during the Han Dynasty. Chinese astronomers made two more notable supernova observations during the Song Dynasty: the SN 1006, the brightest recorded supernova in history; and the SN 1054, making the Crab Nebula the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion.[27]</p><p>During the early half of the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the study of archaeology developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies.[28] This and the belief that ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who took an interdisciplinary approach to archaeology, incorporating his archaeological findings into studies on metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures.[28] His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze, which Patricia B. Ebrey says pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archaeology.[29] In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry—such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)—supported the primacy of contemporaneous archaeological finds of ancient inscriptions over historical works written after the fact, which they contested to be unreliable in regard to the former evidence.[30] Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han Dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).[30]</p><p>In addition to his studies in meteorology, astronomy, and archaeology mentioned above, Shen Kuo also made hypotheses in regards to geology and climatology in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, specifically his claims regarding geomorphology and climate change. Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to perpetual erosion, uplift, and deposition of silt, and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a cliffside at Taihang as evidence that the area was once the location of an ancient seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles east over an enormous span of time.[31][32][33] Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a dry northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.[33][34]</p><h3>Mongol transmission</h3><p>Mongol rule under the Yuan Dynasty saw technological advances from an economic perspective, with the first mass production of paper banknotes by Kublai Khan in the 13th century.[1] Numerous contacts between Europe and the Mongols occurred in the 13th century, particularly through the unstable Franco-Mongol alliance. Chinese corps, expert in siege warfare, formed an integral part of the Mongol armies campaigning in the West. In 1259-1260 military alliance of the Franks knights of the ruler of Antioch, Bohemond VI and his father-in-law Hetoum I with the Mongols under Hulagu, in which they fought together for the conquests of Muslim Syria, taking together the city of Aleppo, and later Damascus.[35] William of Rubruck, an ambassador to the Mongols in 1254-1255, a personal friend of Roger Bacon, is also often designated as a possible intermediary in the transmission of gunpowder know-how between the East and the West.[36] The compass is often said to have been introduced by the Master of the Knights Templar Pierre de Montaigu between 1219 and 1223, from one of his travels to visit the Mongols in Persia.[37]</p><p>Chinese and Arabic astronomy intermingled under Mongol rule. Muslim astronomers worked in the Chinese Astronomical Bureau established by Kublai Khan, while some Chinese astronomers also worked at the Persian Maragha observatory.[38] Before this, in ancient times, Indian astronomers had lent their expertise to the Chinese court.[39]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Theory and hypothesis</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Sea_island_survey.jpg/180px-Sea_island_survey.jpg" width="180" height="267"><p>

			As Toby E. Huff notes, pre-modern Chinese science developed precariously without solid scientific theory, while there was a lacking of consistent systemic treatment in comparison to contemporaneous European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century).[40] This drawback to Chinese science was lamented even by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298), who criticized earlier mathematicians such as Li Chunfeng (602–670) who were content with using methods without working out their theoretical origins or principle, stating:</p><p>The men of old changed the name of their methods from problem to problem, so that as no specific explanation was given, there is no way of telling their theoretical origin or basis.</p><p>Despite this, Chinese thinkers of the Middle Ages proposed some hypotheses which are in accordance with modern principles of science. Yang Hui provided theoretical proof for the proposition that the complements of the parallelograms which are about the diameter of any given parallelogram are equal to one another.[41] Sun Sikong (1015–1076) proposed the idea that rainbows were the result of the contact between sunlight and moisture in the air, while Shen Kuo (1031–1095) expanded upon this with description of atmospheric refraction.[42][43][44] Shen believed that rays of sunlight refracted before reaching the surface of the earth, hence the appearance of the observed sun from earth did not match its exact location.[44] Coinciding with the astronomical work of his colleague Wei Pu, Shen and Wei realized that the old calculation technique for the mean sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase.[45] Shen supported and expanded upon beliefs earlier proposed by Han Dynasty (202 BCE–202 CE) scholars such as Jing Fang (78–37 BCE) and Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) that lunar eclipse occurs when the earth obstructs the sunlight traveling towards the moon, a solar eclipse is the moon's obstruction of sunlight reaching earth, the moon is spherical like a ball and not flat like a disc, and moonlight is merely sunlight reflected from the moon's surface.[46] Shen also explained that the observance of a full moon occurred when the sun's light was slanting at a certain degree and that crescent phases of the moon proved that the moon was spherical, using a metaphor of observing different angles of a silver ball with white powder thrown onto one side.[47][48] It should be noted that, although the Chinese accepted the idea of spherical-shaped heavenly bodies, the concept of a spherical earth (as opposed to a flat earth) was not accepted in Chinese thought until the works of Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) and Chinese astronomer Xu Guangqi (1562–1633) in the early 17th century.[49]</p><h3>Pharmacology</h3><p> Main article: Traditional Chinese medicine</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>There were noted advances in traditional Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages. Emperor Gaozong (reigned 649–683) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) commissioned the scholarly compilation of a materia medica in 657 that documented 833 medicinal substances taken from stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.[50] In his Bencao Tujing ('Illustrated Pharmacopoeia'), the scholar-official Su Song (1020–1101) not only systematically categorized herbs and minerals according to their pharmaceutical uses, but he also took an interest in zoology.[51][52][53][54] For example, Su made systematic descriptions of animal species and the environmental regions they could be found, such as the freshwater crab Eriocher sinensis found in the Huai River running through Anhui, in waterways near the capital city, as well as reservoirs and marshes of Hebei.[55]</p><p>Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi in 896, mentions the popular introduction of various Chinese herbs and aloes in Baghdad.</p><h3>Horology and clockworks</h3><p>Although the Bencao Tujing was an important pharmaceutical work of the age, Su Song is perhaps better known for his work in horology. His book Xinyi Xiangfayao (?????; lit. 'Essentials of a New Method for Mechanizing the Rotation of an Armillary Sphere and a Celestial Globe') documented the intricate mechanics of his astronomical clock tower in Kaifeng. This included the use of an escapement mechanism and world's first known chain drive to power the rotating armillary sphere crowning the top as well as the 133 clock jack figurines positioned on a rotating wheel that sounded the hours by banging drums, clashing gongs, striking bells, and holding plaques with special announcements appearing from open-and-close shutter windows.[56][57][58][59] While it had been Zhang Heng who applied the first motive power to the armillary sphere via hydraulics in 125 CE,[60][61] it was Yi Xing (683–727) in 725 CE who first applied an escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe and striking clock.[62] The early Song Dynasty horologist Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) employed liquid mercury in his astronomical clock because there were complaints that water would freeze too easily in the clepsydra tanks during winter.[63]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Al-jazari_elephant_clock.png/200px-Al-jazari_elephant_clock.png" width="200" height="313"><p>

During the 11th century, the growth of the iron industry caused vast deforestation due to the use of charcoal in the smelting process.[74][75] To remedy the problem of deforestation, the Song Chinese discovered how to produce coke from bituminous coal as a substitute for charcoal.[74][75] Although hydraulic-powered bellows for heating the blast furnace had been written of since Du Shi's (d. 38) invention of the 1st century CE, the first known drawn and printed illustration of it in operation is found in a book written in 1313 by Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333).[76]</p><h3>Mathematics</h3><p> Main article: Chinese mathematics</p><p>Qin Jiushao (c. 1202–1261) was the first to introduce the zero symbol into Chinese mathematics.[77] Before this innovation, blank spaces were used instead of zeros in the system of counting rods.[78] Pascal's triangle was first illustrated in China by Yang Hui in his book Xiangjie Jiuzhang Suanfa (??????), although it was described earlier around 1100 by Jia Xian.[79] Although the Introduction to Computational Studies (????) written by Zhu Shijie (fl. 13th century) in 1299 contained nothing new in Chinese algebra, it had a great impact on the development of Japanese mathematics.[80]</p><h3>Alchemy and Taoism</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/%E3%81%A6%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AF%E3%81%86%EF%BC%88%E9%9C%87%E5%A4%A9%E9%9B%B7%EF%BC%89.JPG/220px-%E3%81%A6%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AF%E3%81%86%EF%BC%88%E9%9C%87%E5%A4%A9%E9%9B%B7%EF%BC%89.JPG" width="220" height="138"><p>

		Jesuits in China.


		</p><p>
			The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China. One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography.[90] The Society of Jesus introduced, according to Thomas Woods, a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible.[2] Another expert quoted by Woods said the scientific revolution brought by the Jesuits coincided with a time when science was at a very low level in China:</p><p>[The Jesuits] made efforts to translate western mathematical and astronomical works into Chinese and aroused the interest of Chinese scholars in these sciences. They made very extensive astronomical observation and carried out the first modern cartographic work in China. They also learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture.</p><p>Conversely, the Jesuits were very active in transmitting Chinese knowledge to Europe. Confucius's works were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit scholars stationned in China. Matteo Ricci started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and Father Prospero Intorcetta published the life and works of Confucius into Latin in 1687.[91] It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Christianity.[92][93]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The followers of the French physiocrat François Quesnay habitually referred to him as the Confucius of Europe, and he personally identified himself with the Chinese sage.[94] The doctrine and even the name of Laissez-faire may have been inspired by the Chinese concept of Wu wei.[95][96] However, the economic insights of ancient Chinese political thought had otherwise little impact outside China in later centuries.[97] Goethe, was known as the Confucius of Weimar.[98]</p><h2>Scientific and technological stagnation</h2><p> Further information: Great Divergence</p><p>One question that has been the subject of debate among historians has been why China did not develop a scientific revolution and why Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic. John K. Fairbank, for example, argued that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress. As for Needham, he wrote that cultural factors prevented traditional Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called science. It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature:</p><p>It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.</p><p>Another prominent historian of science, Nathan Sivin, has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century but it's just that we are still not able to really understand the scientific revolution that took place in China. Sivin suggests that we need to look at the scientific development in China on its own terms.[100]</p><p>There are also questions about the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived partly from Taoist philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Philosopher Robert Todd Carroll, a member of the Skeptics Society, deemed acupuncture a pseudoscience because it confuse(s) metaphysical claims with empirical claims.:[101]</p><p>More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have put greater focus on economic causes. Mark Elvin's high level equilibrium trap is one well-known example of this line of thought. It argues that the Chinese population was large enough, workers cheap enough, and agrarian productivity high enough to not require mechanization: thousands of Chinese workers were perfectly able to quickly perform any needed task. Other events such as Haijin, the Opium Wars and the resulting hate of European influence prevented China from undergoing an Industrial Revolution; copying Europe's progress on a large scale would be impossible for a lengthy period of time. Political instability under Cixi rule (opposition and frequent oscillation between modernists and conservatives), the Republican wars (1911–1933), the Sino-Japanese War (1933–1945), the Communist/Nationalist War (1945–1949) as well as the later Cultural Revolution isolated China at the most critical times. Kenneth Pomeranz has made the argument that the substantial resources taken from the New World to Europe made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.</p><p>In his book Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond postulates that the lack of geographic barriers within much of China&nbsp;– essentially a wide plain with two large navigable rivers and a relatively smooth coastline&nbsp;– led to a single government without competition. At the whim of a ruler who disliked new inventions, technology could be stifled for half a century or more. In contrast, Europe's barriers of the Pyrennes, the Alps, and the various defensible peninsulas (Denmark, Scandinavia, Italy, Greece, etc.) and islands (Britain, Ireland, Sicily, etc.) led to smaller countries in constant competition with each other. If a ruler chose to ignore a scientific advancement (especially a military or economic one), his more-advanced neighbors would soon usurp his throne. This explanation, however, ignores the fact that China had been politically fragmented in the past, and was thus not inherently disposed to political unification.[102]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>The Republic of China (1912–49)</h2><p>The Republican period (1911-1949) saw the introduction in earnest of modern science to China. Large numbers of Chinese students studied abroad in Japan and in Europe and the US. Many returned to help teach and to found numerous schools and universities. Among them were numerous outstanding figures, including Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shi, Weng Wenhao, Ding Wenjiang, Fu Ssu-nien, and many others. As a result, there was a tremendous growth of modern science in China. As the Communist Party took over China's mainland in 1949, some of these Chinese scientists and institutions moved to Taiwan. The central science academy, Academia Sinica, also moved there.</p><h2>People's Republic of China</h2><p> Main article: History of science and technology in the People's Republic of China</p><p>After the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, China reorganized its science establishment along Soviet lines. The country regressed scientifically as a result of government policies which led to famine during the Great Leap Forward and political chaos during the Cultural Revolution. From 1975, science and technology was one of the Four Modernizations, and its high-speed development was declared essential to all national economic development by Deng Xiaoping. Scientific research in nuclear weapons, satellite launching and recovery, superconductivity, high-yield hybrid rice led to new developments due to the application of science to industry and foreign technology transfer.</p><p>As the People's Republic of China becomes better connected to the global economy, the government has placed more emphasis on science and technology. This has led to increases in funding, improved scientific structure, and more money for research. These factors have led to advancements in agriculture, medicine, genetics, and global change.</p><p>In 2003, China became the third country to send humans into space.</p><h3>Citations</h3><h3>Sources</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_science_and_technology_in_China&amp;oldid=782397435"

		3. This compound is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, such as those used in photography. It is far less sensitive to light than the halides. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the moon.[8]</p><p>In solid silver nitrate, the silver ions are three-coordinated in a trigonal planar arrangement.[5]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Discovery</h2><p>Albertus Magnus, in the 13th century, documented the ability of nitric acid to separate gold and silver by dissolving the silver.[9] Magnus noted that the resulting solution of silver nitrate could blacken skin.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Synthesis</h2><p>Silver nitrate can be prepared by reacting silver, such as a silver bullion or silver foil, with nitric acid, resulting in silver nitrate, water, and oxides of nitrogen. Reaction byproducts depend upon the concentration of nitric acid used.</p><p>This is performed under a fume hood because of toxic nitrogen oxide(s) evolved during the reaction.[10]</p><h2>Reactions</h2><p>A typical reaction with silver nitrate is to suspend a rod of copper in a solution of silver nitrate and leave it for a few hours. The silver nitrate reacts with copper to form hairlike crystals of silver metal and a blue solution of copper nitrate:</p><p>Silver nitrate decomposes when heated:</p><p>Qualitatively, decomposition is negligible below the melting point, but becomes appreciable around 250&nbsp;°C and totally decompose at 440&nbsp;°C.[11]</p><p>Most metal nitrates thermally decompose to the respective oxides, but silver oxide decomposes at a lower temperature than silver nitrate, so the decomposition of silver nitrate yields elemental silver instead.</p><h2>Uses</h2><h3>Precursor to other silver compounds</h3><p>Silver nitrate is the least expensive salt of silver; it offers several other advantages as well. It is non-hygroscopic, in contrast to silver fluoroborate and silver perchlorate. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other ligands, rendering AgNO3 versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making photographic film, silver nitrate is treated with halide salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble silver halide in situ in photographic gelatin, which is then applied to strips of tri-acetate or polyester. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some silver-based explosives, such as the fulminate, azide, or acetylide, through a precipitation reaction.</p><p>Treatment of silver nitrate with base gives dark grey silver oxide:[12]</p><h3>Halide abstraction</h3><p>The silver cation, Ag+, reacts quickly with halide sources to produce the insoluble silver halide, which is a cream precipitate if Br- is used, a white precipitate if Cl- is used and a yellow precipitate if I- is used. This reaction is commonly used in inorganic chemistry to abstract halides:</p><p>where X- = Cl-, Br-, or I-.</p><p>Other silver salts with non-coordinating anions, namely silver tetrafluoroborate and silver hexafluorophosphate are used for more demanding applications.</p><p>Similarly, this reaction is used in analytical chemistry to confirm the presence of chloride, bromide, or iodide ions can be tested by adding silver nitrate solution. Samples are typically acidified with dilute nitric acid to remove interfering ions, e.g. carbonate ions and sulfide ions. This step avoids confusion of silver sulfide or silver carbonate precipitates with that of silver halides. The color of precipitate varies with the halide: white (silver chloride), pale yellow/cream (silver bromide), yellow (silver iodide). AgBr and especially AgI photo-decompose to the metal, as evidence by a grayish color on exposed samples.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The same reaction was used on steamships in order to determine whether or not boiler feedwater had been contaminated with seawater. It is still used to determine if moisture on formerly dry cargo is a result of condensation from humid air, or from seawater leaking through the hull.[13]</p><h3>Organic synthesis</h3><p>Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.[14]</p><h3>Biology</h3><p>In histology, silver nitrate is used for silver staining, for demonstrating reticular fibers, proteins and nucleic acids. For this reason it is also used to demonstrate proteins in PAGE gels. It can be used as a stain in scanning electron microscopy.[15]</p><h2>Medicine</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Atypical_leiomyoma_intermed_mag.jpg/220px-Atypical_leiomyoma_intermed_mag.jpg" width="220" height="330"><p>

			Silver salts have antiseptic properties. In 1881 Credé introduced the use of dilute solutions of AgNO3 in newborn babies' eyes at birth to prevent contraction of gonorrhea from the mother, which could cause blindness. (Modern antibiotics are now used instead.)[16][17][18] Fused silver nitrate, shaped into sticks, was traditionally called lunar caustic. It is used as a cauterizing agent, for example to remove granulation tissue around a stoma. General Sir James Abbott noted in his journals that in India in 1827 it was infused by a British surgeon into wounds in his arm resulting from the bite of a mad dog to cauterize the wounds and prevent the onset of rabies.[19] Dentists sometimes use silver nitrate infused swabs to heal oral ulcers. Silver nitrate is also used by some podiatrists to kill cells located in the nail bed. Silver nitrate is also used to cauterize superficial blood vessels in the nose to help prevent nose bleeds.</p><p>The Canadian physician C. A. Douglas Ringrose researched the use of silver nitrate for sterilization procedures on women, believing that silver nitrate could be used to block and corrode the fallopian tubes.[20] The technique was ineffective.[21]</p><h3>Disinfection</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Much research has been done in evaluating the ability of the silver ion at inactivating Escherichia coli, a microorganism commonly used as an indicator for fecal contamination and as a surrogate for pathogens in drinking water treatment. Concentrations of silver nitrate evaluated in inactivation experiments range from 10–200 micrograms per liter as Ag+. Silver's antimicrobial activity saw many applications prior to the discovery of modern antibiotics, when it fell into near disuse. Its association with argyria made consumers wary and led them to turn away from it when given an alternative.</p><h3>Against warts</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Silver_nitrate_stains.jpg/220px-Silver_nitrate_stains.jpg" width="220" height="165"><p>


		Skin stained by silver nitrate

			Repeated daily application of silver nitrate can induce adequate destruction of cutaneous warts, but occasionally pigmented scars may develop. In a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% one month after treatment compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group.[22]</p><h2>Safety</h2><p>As an oxidant, silver nitrate should be properly stored away from organic compounds. Despite its common usage in extremely low concentrations to prevent gonorrhea and control nose bleeds, silver nitrate is still very much toxic and corrosive.[23] Brief exposure will not produce any immediate side effects other than the purple, brown or black stains on the skin, but upon constant exposure to high concentrations, side effects will be noticeable, which include burns. Long-term exposure may cause eye damage. Silver nitrate is known to be a skin and eye irritant. Silver nitrate has not been thoroughly investigated for potential carcinogenic effect.[24]</p><p>Silver nitrate is currently unregulated in water sources by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, if more than 1 gram of silver is accumulated in the body, a condition called argyria may develop. Argyria is a permanent cosmetic condition in which the skin and internal organs turn a blue-gray color. The United States Environmental Protection Agency used to have a maximum contaminant limit for silver in water until 1990, when it was determined that argyria did not impact the function of any affected organs.[25] Argyria is more often associated with the consumption of colloidal silver solutions rather than with silver nitrate, since it is only used at extremely low concentrations to disinfect the water. However, it is still important to be wary before ingesting any sort of silver-ion solution.</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silver_nitrate&amp;oldid=782546608"

		Shen Kuo (??) (1031-1095 AD)


		</p><p>
			The Dream Pool Essays or Dream Torrent Essays[1] (Pinyin: Mèng Xi Bi Tán; Wade-Giles: Meng4 Hsi¹ Pi³-t'an²; Chinese: ????/????) was an extensive book written by the Han Chinese polymath, genius, scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031-1095) by 1088 AD, during the Song dynasty (960-1279) of China. Although Shen was previously a highly renowned government official and military general, he compiled this enormous written work while virtually isolated on his lavish garden estate near modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province. He named the book after the name he gave to his estate, the Dream Brook. The literal translated meaning is Brush Talks from a Dream Brook, and Shen Kuo is quoted as saying:[2]</p><p>Because I had only my writing brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>History</h2><p>As the historian Chen Dengyuan points out, much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister Cai Jing (1046-1126).[3] For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.[4] The Dream Pool Essays was first quoted in a Chinese written work of 1095 AD, showing that even towards the end of Shen's life his final book was becoming widely printed.[5] The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 AD edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.[5] There is one surviving copy of this 1166 edition housed now in Japan, while a Chinese reprint was produced in 1305 as well.[5] In 1631 another edition was printed, but it was heavily reorganized into three broad chapters.[5]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Recent translations</h2><h2>Quotes</h2><h3>Geological theory</h3><p>With Shen's writings on fossils, geomorphology, and shifting geographical climates, he states in the following passages:</p><p>In the Zhi-ping reign period [1064–67 AD] a man of Zezhou was digging a well in his garden, and unearthed something shaped like a squirming serpent, or dragon. He was so frightened by it that he dared not touch it, but after some time, seeing that it did not move, he examined it and found it to be stone. The ignorant country people smashed it, but Zheng Boshun, who was magistrate of Jincheng at the time, got hold of a large piece of it on which scale-like markings were to be seen exactly like those on a living creature. Thus a serpent or some kind of marine snake (chhen) had certainly been turned to stone, as happens with the 'stone-crabs'.[8][9]</p><p>In recent years [cca. 1080] there was a landslide on the bank of a large river in Yong-ning Guan near Yanzhou. The bank collapsed, opening a space of several dozens of feet, and under the ground a forest of bamboo shoots was thus revealed. It contained several hundred bamboo with their roots and trunks all complete, and all turned to stone...Now bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou. These were several dozens of feet below the present surface of the ground, and we do not know in what dynasty they could possibly have grown. Perhaps in very ancient times the climate was different so that the place was low, damp, gloomy, and suitable for bamboos. On the Jin-hua Shan in Wuzhou there are stone pine-cones, and stones formed from peach kernels, stone bulrush roots, stone fishes, crabs, and so on, but as these are all (modern) native products of that place, people are not very surprised at them. But these petrified bamboos appeared under the ground so deep, though they are not produced in that place today. This is a very strange thing.[9][10]</p><h3>Astronomy</h3><p>When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the sun and moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained his reasoning for the former:</p><p>If they were like balls they would surely obstruct each other when they met. I replied that these celestial bodies were certainly like balls. How do we know this? By the waxing and waning of the moon. The moon itself gives forth no light, but is like a ball of silver; the light is the light of the sun (reflected). When the brightness is first seen, the sun(-light passes almost) alongside, so the side only is illuminated and looks like a crescent. When the sun gradually gets further away, the light shines slanting, and the moon is full, round like a bullet. If half of a sphere is covered with (white) powder and looked at from the side, the covered part will look like a crescent; if looked at from the front, it will appear round. Thus we know that the celestial bodies are spherical.[11]</p><p>When the director of the astronomical observatory asked Shen Kuo why eclipses occurred only on an occasional basis while in conjunction and opposition once a day, Shen Kuo wrote:</p><p>I answered that the ecliptic and the moon's path are like two rings, lying one over the other, but distant by a small amount. (If this obliquity did not exist), the sun would be eclipsed whenever the two bodies were in conjunction, and the moon would be eclipsed whenever they were exactly in position. But (in fact) though they may occupy the same degree, the two paths are not (always) near (each other), and so naturally the bodies do not (intrude) upon one another.[11]</p><p>On the use of the sighting tube to fix the position of the pole star, Shen Kuo wrote:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Before Han times it was believed that the pole star was in the center of the sky, so it was called Jixing (Summit star). Zu Geng(-zhi) found out with the help of the sighting tube that the point in the sky which really does not move was a little more than 1 degree away from the summit star. In the Xining reign-period (1068-1077) I accepted the order of the emperor to take charge of the Bureau of the Calendar. I then tried to find the true pole by means of the tube. On the very first night I noticed that the star which could be seen through the tube moved after a while outside the field of view. I realized, therefore, that the tube was too small, so I increased the size of the tube by stages. After three months' trials I adjusted it so that the star would go round and round within the field of view without disappearing. In this way I found that the pole star was distant from the true pole somewhat more than 3 degrees. We used to make the diagrams of the field, plotting the positions of the star from the time when it entered the field of view, observing after nightfall, at midnight, and early in the morning before dawn. Two hundred of such diagrams showed that the 'pole star' was really a circumpolar star. And this I stated in my detailed report to the emperor.[12]</p><h3>Movable type printing</h3><p>On the methods of Bi Sheng's invention of movable type printing between the years 1041 to 1048 AD, Shen Kuo wrote:</p><p>[Bi Sheng] took sticky clay and cut in it characters as thin as the edge of a coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in the fire to make them hard. He had previously prepared an iron plate and he had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone. If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.[13]</p><h3>Personal beliefs and philosophy</h3><p>Of Daoism and the inability of empirical science to explain everything in the world, Shen Kuo wrote:</p><p>Those in the world who speak of the regularities underlying the phenomena, it seems, manage to apprehend their crude traces. But these regularities have their very subtle aspect, which those who rely on mathematical astronomy cannot know of. Still even these are nothing more than traces. As for the spiritual processes described in the [Book of Changes] that when they are stimulated, penetrate every situation in the realm, mere traces have nothing to do with them. This spiritual state by which foreknowledge is attained can hardly be sought through changes, of which in any case only the cruder sort are attainable. What I have called the subtlest aspect of these traces, those who discuss the celestial bodies attempt to know by depending on mathematical astronomy; but astronomy is nothing more than the outcome of conjecture.[14]</p><h3>Dissertation on the Timberwork Manual</h3><p>Below are two passages from Shen's book outlining the basics contained in Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual. Yu Hao was a Chinese architect of the earlier 10th, and Kuo was one to praise his work. In the first quote, Shen Kuo describes a scene where Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan architect about slanting struts for diagonal wind bracing:</p><p>When Mr. Qian (Wei-yan) was Governor of the two Zhejiang provinces, he authorized the building of a wooden pagoda at the Fan-tian Si (Brahma-Heaven Temple) in Hangzhou with a design of twice three stories. While it was under construction General Chhien went up to the top and was worried because it swayed a little. But the Master-Builder explained that as the tiles had not yet been put on, the upper part was still rather light, hence the effect. So then they put on all the tiles, but the sway continued as before. Being at a loss what to do, he privately sent his wife to see the wife of Yu Hao with a present of golden hair pins, and enquire about the cause of the motion. (Yu) Hao laughed and said: 'That's easy, just fit in struts (pan) to settle the work, fixed with (iron) nails, and it will not move any more.' The Master-Builder followed his advice, and the tower stood quite firm. This is because the nailed struts filled in and bound together (all the members) up and down so that the six planes (above and below, front and back, left and right) were mutually linked like the cage of the thorax. Although people might walk on the struts, the six planes grasped and supported each other, so naturally there could be no more motion. Everybody acknowledged the expertise thus shown.[15]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In this next quote, Shen Kuo describes the dimensions and types of architecture outlined in Yu Hao's book:</p><p>Methods of building construction are described in the Timberwork Manual, which, some say, was written by Yu Hao. (According to that book), buildings have three basic units of proportion, what is above the cross-beams follows the Upperwork Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams as well as the rafters, etc. Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8&nbsp;ft) length, an uppermost cross-beam of (3.5&nbsp;ft) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the Upperwork Unit. Similarly, the dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be used, as also those of the (side-) rafters, etc. For example, a column (11&nbsp;ft) high will need a platform (4.5&nbsp;ft) high. So also for all the other components, corbelled brackets, projecting rafters, other rafters, all have their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from the imperial litters. Steep ramps are ramps for ascending which the leading and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps are those for which the leaders use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate ones are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu Hao) had three chapters. But builders in recent years have become much more precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a masterpiece in itself![16]</p><h3>Botany and zoology</h3><p>Shen Kuo described the natural predator insect similarly shaped to the gou-he (dog-grubs) which preyed upon the agricultural pest infestation of zi-fang, the moth Leucania separata:[17]</p><p>In the Yuan-Feng reign period (1078-1085), in the Qingzhou region, an outbreak of zi-fang insects caused serious damage to the crops in the fields in autumn. Suddenly another insect appeared in swarms of thousands and tens of thousands, covering the entire ground area. It was shaped like earth-burrowing gou-he (dog grubs), and its mouth was flanked by pincers. Whenever it met a zi-fang, it would seize it with the pincers and break the poor beast into two bits. Within ten days all the zi-fang had disappeared, so the locality had an abundant harvest. Such kinds of insects have been known since antiquity and the local people call them pang-bu-ken (not allowing other [insects] to be).[17]</p><h3>Natural phenomena</h3><p>Around 1078, Shen Kuo wrote an accurate description of the damaging effects of lightning to buildings and to the specific materials of objects within. Taking an objective and speculative viewpoint, he stated:</p><p>A house belonging to Li Shunju was struck by lightning. Brilliant sparkling light was seen under the eaves. Everyone thought that the hall would be burnt, and those who were inside rushed out. After the thunder had abated, the house was found to be alright, though its walls and the paper on the windows were blackened. On certain wooden shelves, certain lacquered vessels with silver mouths had been struck by the lightning, so that the silver had melted and dropped to the ground, but the lacquer was not even scorched. Also, a valuable sword made of strong steel had been melted to liquid, without the parts of the house nearby being affected. One would have thought that the thatch and wood would have been burnt up first, yet here were metals melted and no injury to thatch and wood. This is beyond the understanding of ordinary people. There are Buddhist books which speak of 'dragon fire' which burns more fiercely when it meets with water instead of being extinguished by water like 'human' fire.i[›] Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.[18]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><h3>Strange Happenings</h3><p>A passage called Strange Happenings contains a peculiar account of an unidentified flying object. Shen wrote that, during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022–1063), an object as bright as a pearl occasionally hovered over the city of Yangzhou at night, but described first by local inhabitants of eastern Anhui and then in Jiangsu.[19] Shen wrote that a man near Xingkai Lake observed this curious object; allegedly it:</p><p>...opened its door and a flood of intense light like sunbeams darted out of it, then the outer shell opened up, appearing as large as a bed with a big pearl the size of a fist illuminating the interior in silvery white. The intense silver-white light, shot from the interior, was too strong for human eyes to behold; it cast shadows of every tree within a radius of ten miles. The spectacle was like the rising Sun, lighting up the distant sky and woods in red. Then all of a sudden, the object took off at a tremendous speed and descended upon the lake like the Sun setting.[20]</p><p>Shen went on to say that Yibo, a poet of Gaoyou, wrote a poem about this pearl after witnessing it. Shen wrote that since the pearl often made an appearance around Fanliang in Yangzhou, the people there erected a Pearl Pavilion on a wayside, where people came by boat in hopes to see the mysterious flying object.[21]</p><h3>Swords</h3><p>Around 1065 Shen Kuo wrote about the assembly methods for swords, and the patterns produced in the steel:[22]</p><p>Ancient people use chi kang, (combined steel), for the edge, and jou thieh (soft iron) for the back, otherwise it would often break. Too strong a weapon will cut and destroy its own edge; that is why it is advisable to use nothing but combined steel. As for the yu-chhang (fish intestines) effect, it is what is now called the 'snake-coiling' steel sword, or alternatively, the 'pine tree design'. If you cook a fish fully and remove its bones, the shape of its guts will be seen to be like the lines on a 'snake-coiling sword'.[23]</p><h3>Chinese clothing</h3><p>Shen Kuo observed that the Chinese since some centuries prior had entirely adopted barbarian fashions.</p><p>????,?????,?????????????????????,???????????,????????????????,?????,??????????????????????,???,??,????,??????????????,?????????????????</p><p>The clothing of China since the Northern Qi [550–557] onward has been entirely made barbarian. Narrow sleeves, short dark red or green robes, tall boots and metal girdle ornaments are all barbarian garb. The narrow sleeves are useful when shooting while galloping. The short robes and tall boots are convenient when passing through tall grass. The barbarians all enjoy thick grass as they always sleep in it. I saw them all do it when I was sent north. Even the king's court is in the deep grasses. On the day I had arrived at the barbarian court the new rains had passed and I waded through the grass. My robes and trousers were all soaked, but the barbarians were not at all wet. With things hanging from robe and belt they walk about. One perhaps might want to hang items like a bow and blade, handkerchief, coin purse or knife from the belt.</p><h2>Book chapters</h2><p>On the humanities:</p><p>On natural sciences:</p><p>Humanistic sciences:</p><p>(Total number of paragraphs = 584)[24]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Notes</h2><h3>Citations</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dream_Pool_Essays&amp;oldid=764531857"

Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a mathematician, astronomer, meteorologist, geologist, zoologist, botanist, pharmacologist, agronomist, archaeologist, ethnographer, cartographer, encyclopedist, general, diplomat, hydraulic engineer, inventor, academy chancellor, finance minister, governmental state inspector, poet, and musician. He was the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy in the Song court, as well as an Assistant Minister of Imperial Hospitality.[2] At court his political allegiance was to the Reformist faction known as the New Policies Group, headed by Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086).</p><p>In his Dream Pool Essays or Dream Torrent Essays[3] (????; Mengxi Bitan) of 1088, Shen was the first to describe the magnetic needle compass, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by Alexander Neckam in 1187).[4][5] Shen discovered the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole,[5] with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and the improved meridian determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the pole star and true north.[6] This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancer compasses in regard to declination).[7][8]</p><p>Alongside his colleague Wei Pu, Shen planned to map the orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court.[9] To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented a new type of inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt.[10] He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations.[11] Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.</p><p>Shen Kuo wrote several other books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet much of the writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was preserved in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he had an interest in divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Life</h2><h3>Birth and youth</h3><p>Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (??; 978–1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (?).[12] Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period.[12]a[›] She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi (?) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (??; 975–1016).[12] Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the Imperial Exams and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat.[12]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Pen_ts%27ao%2C_woodblock_book_1249-ce.png/220px-Pen_ts%27ao%2C_woodblock_book_1249-ce.png" width="220" height="158"><p>

			From about 1040, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location.[13] Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a federal supreme court.[12] Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land.[13] He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official.[13] Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.[13]</p><p>Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055).[14] As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400&nbsp;km²) of swampland into prime farmland.[14] Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals.[15]</p><h3>Official career</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Shenzong_of_Song.jpg/170px-Shenzong_of_Song.jpg" width="170" height="261"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			In 1063 Shen Kuo successfully passed the Imperial examinations, the difficult national-level standard test that every high official was required to pass in order to enter the governmental system.[14] He not only passed the exam however, but was placed into the higher category of the best and brightest students.[14] While serving at Yangzhou, Shen's brilliance and dutiful character caught the attention of Zhang Chu (??; 1015–1080), the Fiscal Intendant of the region. Shen made a lasting impression upon Zhang, who recommended Shen for a court appointment in the financial administration of the central court.[14] Shen would also eventually marry Zhang's daughter, who became his second wife.</p><p>In his career as a scholar-official for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an ambassador to the Western Xia Dynasty and Liao Dynasty,[16] a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the Hanlin Academy.[17] By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy.[14] With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science,[11] and proposed many reforms to the Chinese calendar alongside the work of his colleague Wei Pu.[9] With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court.[18]</p><p>As written by Li Zhiyi, a man married to Hu Wenrou (granddaughter of Hu Su, a famous minister of the Song Dynasty), Shen Kuo was Li's mentor while Shen served as an official.[19] According to Li's epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician.[19] Shen lamented: If only she were a man, Wenrou would be my friend.[19]</p><p>While employed by the central government, Shen Kuo was also sent out with others to inspect the granary system of the empire, investigating problems of illegal collections, negligence, ineffective disaster relief, and inadequate water-conservancy projects.[20] While Shen was appointed as the regional inspector of Zhejiang in 1073, the Emperor requested that Shen pay a visit to the famous poet Su Shi (1037–1101), then an administrator in Hangzhou.[21] Shen took advantage of this meeting to copy some of Su's poetry, which he presented to the Emperor indicating that it expressed abusive and hateful speech against the Song court; these poems were later politicized by Li Ding and Shu Dan in order to level a court case against Su.[21] (The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, of 1079.) With his demonstrations of loyalty and ability, Shen Kuo was awarded the honorary title of a State Foundation Viscount by Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085), who placed a great amount of trust in Shen Kuo.[18] He was even made 'companion to the heir apparent' (????; 'Taizi zhongyun').[1]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Wang_Anshi.jpg/170px-Wang_Anshi.jpg" width="170" height="228"><p>

			At court Shen was a political favorite of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086), who was the leader of the political faction of Reformers, also known as the New Policies Group (??, Xin Fa).[22]b[›] Shen Kuo had a previous history with Wang Anshi, since it was Wang who had composed the funerary epitaph for Shen's father, Zhou.[23] Shen Kuo soon impressed Wang Anshi with his skills and abilities as an administrator and government agent. In 1072, Shen was sent to supervise Wang's program of surveying the building of silt deposits in the Bian Canal outside the capital city. Using an original technique, Shen successfully dredged the canal and demonstrated the formidable value of the silt gathered as a fertilizer.[23] He gained further reputation at court once he was dispatched as an envoy to the Khitan Liao Dynasty in the summer of 1075.[23] The Khitans had made several aggressive negotiations of pushing their borders south, while manipulating several incompetent Song ambassadors who conceded to the Liao Kingdom's demands.[23] In a brilliant display of diplomacy, Shen Kuo came to the camp of the Khitan monarch at Mt. Yongan (near modern Pingquan, Hebei), armed with copies of previously archived diplomatic negotiations between the Song and Liao dynasties.[23] Shen Kuo refuted Emperor Daozong's bluffs point for point, while the Song reestablished their rightful border line.[23] In regard to the Lý Dynasty of Ð?i Vi?t (in modern northern Vietnam), Shen demonstrated in his Dream Pool Essays that he was familiar with the key players (on the Vietnamese side) in the prelude to the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1075–1077.[24] With his reputable achievements, Shen became a trusted member of Wang Anshi's elite circle of eighteen unofficial core political loyalists to the New Policies Group.[23]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/China_11a.jpg/220px-China_11a.jpg" width="220" height="216"><p>


		Boundaries of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Liao Dynasty, and the Western Xia.


		</p><p>
			Although much of Wang Anshi's reforms outlined in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers,[25] putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would not fall into the hands of enemies),[26][27] and aggressive military policy towards Song's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties.[28] A few years after Song Dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan'an, Shaanxi province).[29] During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song Dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia.[18] The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor.[18] However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory.[18] The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated;[18] Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000.[1] Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.[18]</p><h3>Impeachment and later life</h3><p>The new Chancellor Cai Que (??; 1036–1093) held Shen responsible for the disaster and loss of life.[18] Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office.[18] Shen's life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military.[18] Shen was then put under probation in a fixed residence for the next six years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the ink brush and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two geographical atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to live in a place of his choice.[18] Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him.[18]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Liu_Songnian-Luohan.jpg/170px-Liu_Songnian-Luohan.jpg" width="170" height="354"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Painting of a Buddhist luohan, by Liu Songnian, painted in 1207; Shen Kuo not only listed literati painting as one of his cherished pastimes, but also Buddhist meditation.[30]


		</p><p>
			In his more idle years removed from court affairs, Shen Kuo enjoyed pastimes of the Chinese gentry and literati that would indicate his intellectual level and cultural taste to others.[31] As described in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen Kuo enjoyed the company of the nine guests (??, jiuke), a figure of speech for the Chinese zither, the older 17x17 line variant of weiqi (known today as go), Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine.[30] These nine activities were an extension to the older so-called Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar.</p><p>According to Zhu Yu's book Pingzhou Table Talks (????; Pingzhou Ketan) of 1119, Shen Kuo had two marriages; the second wife was the daughter of Zhang Chu (??), who came from Huainan. Lady Zhang was said to be overbearing and fierce, often abusive to Shen Kuo, even attempting at one time to pull off his beard. Shen Kuo's children were often upset over this, and prostrated themselves to Lady Zhang to quit this behavior. Despite this, Lady Zhang went as far as to drive out Shen Kuo's son from his first marriage, expelling him from the household. However, after Lady Zhang died, Shen Kuo fell into a deep depression and even attempted to jump into the Yangtze River to drown himself. Although this suicide attempt failed, he would die a year later.[32]</p><p>In the 1070s, Shen had purchased a lavish garden estate on the outskirts of modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, a place of great beauty which he named Dream Brook (Mengxi) after he visited it for the first time in 1086.[18] Shen Kuo permanently moved to the Dream Brook Estate in 1088, and in that same year he completed his life's written work of the Dream Pool Essays, naming the book after his garden-estate property. It was there that Shen Kuo spent the last several years of his life in leisure, isolation, and illness, until his death in 1095.[18]</p><h2>Scholarly achievements</h2><p>Shen Kuo wrote extensively on a wide range of different subjects. His written work included two geographical atlases, a treatise on music with mathematical harmonics, governmental administration, mathematical astronomy, astronomical instruments, martial defensive tactics and fortifications, painting, tea, medicine, and much poetry.[33] His scientific writings have been praised by sinologists such as Joseph Needham and Nathan Sivin, and he has been compared by Sivin to polymaths such as his contemporary Su Song, as well as Gottfried Leibniz and Mikhail Lomonosov.[34]</p><h3>Raised-relief map</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/FFM-HanWeingef%C3%A4%C3%9F.JPG/170px-FFM-HanWeingef%C3%A4%C3%9F.JPG" width="170" height="205"><p>

			If the account of Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the unearthing of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC).[36] Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map.[35] The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD.[36][37] Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD).[36] A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant 0.93 m2 (10&nbsp;ft2) jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479).[36]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Shen's largest atlas included twenty three maps of China and foreign regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000.[6] Shen also created a raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.[6][38][39] Zhu Xi (1130–1200) was inspired by the raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.[39][40]</p><p> Further information: Raised-relief map §&nbsp;History, History of cartography §&nbsp;China, and Science and technology of the Han Dynasty §&nbsp;Cartography</p><h3>Pharmacology</h3><p> Further information: Traditional Chinese medicine</p><p>For pharmacology, Shen wrote of the difficulties of adequate diagnosis and therapy, as well as the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs.[41] He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture.[42] In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China.[43][44][45][46] For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.[47]</p><h3>Civil engineering</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Canal_lock.svg/170px-Canal_lock.svg.png" width="170" height="170"><p>

			The writing of Shen Kuo is the only source for the date when the drydock was first used in China.[48] Shen Kuo wrote that during the Xi-Ning reign (1068–1077), the court official Huang Huaixin devised a plan for repairing 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft) long palatial boats that were a century old; essentially, Huang Huaixin devised the first Chinese drydock for suspending boats out of water.[48] These boats were then placed in a roof-covered dock warehouse to protect them from weathering.[48] Shen also wrote about the effectiveness of the new invention (i.e. by the 10th century engineer Qiao Weiyo) of the pound lock to replace the old flash lock design used in canals.[49] He wrote that it saved the work of five hundred annual labors, annual costs of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash, and increased the size limit of boats accommodated from 21 tons/21000 kg to 113 tons/115000 kg.[49]</p><p>If it were not for Shen Kuo's analysis and quoting in his Dream Pool Essays of the writings of the architect Yu Hao (fl. 970), the latter's work would have been lost to history.[50]d[›] Yu designed a famous wooden pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the 'Iron Pagoda') of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen's quotation—or perhaps Shen's own paraphrasing of Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual (??; Mujing)—shows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of building unit proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work.[51][52] However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110), the Treatise on Architectural Methods (????; Yingzao Fashi) of 1103.[52][53] Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the Timberwork Manual quoted by Shen is most likely Shen's summarization of Yu's work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes: According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao.[51]</p><h3>Anatomy</h3><p>The Chinese had long taken an interest in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD the Xin Dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses.[54] Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, When liquid and solid are imbibed together, how can it be that in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?[42] Shen maintained that the larynx was the beginning of a system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach.[55] Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three.[56] Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186–1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.[57]</p><h3>Mathematics and optics</h3><p> Further information: Chinese mathematics</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Yanghui_triangle.gif/170px-Yanghui_triangle.gif" width="170" height="264"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			In the broad field of mathematics, Shen Kuo mastered many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry,[58] circle packing,[59] and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry.[60] Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, as large as 1043.[61] Shen's technique of small increments laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series.[61] Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid.[62] In his formula technique of intersecting circles, he created an approximation of the arc of a circle s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d.[61] Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231–1316).[62] He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298).[63] Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2, was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition 9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2.[64]</p><p>Shen wrote extensively about what he had learned while working for the state treasury, including mathematical problems posed by computing land tax, estimating requirements, currency issues, metrology, and so forth.[65] Shen once computed the amount of terrain space required for battle formations in military strategy,[66] and also computed the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.[67] Shen wrote about the earlier Yi Xing (672–717), a Buddhist monk who applied an early escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe.[68] By using mathematical permutations, Shen described Yi Xing's calculation of possible positions on a go board game. Shen calculated the total number for this using up to five rows and twenty five game pieces, which yielded the number 847,288,609,443.[69][70]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Shen Kuo experimented with the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists had done in the 4th century BC. Although the Iraqi Muslim scientist Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to experiment with camera obscura, Shen Kuo was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to the camera obscura, just several decades after Ibn al-Haytham's death.[71] Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and waisted drum.[72] He also discussed focal points and noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted.[73] Shen, who never asserted that he was the first to experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.[71]</p><h3>Magnetic needle compass</h3><p> Further information: List of Chinese inventions</p><p>Since the time of the engineer and inventor Ma Jun (c. 200–265), the Chinese had used the south-pointing chariot, which did not employ magnetism, as a compass.

		</p><p>
			However, it was not until the time of Shen Kuo that the earliest magnetic compasses would be used for navigation. In his written work, Shen Kuo made the first known explicit reference to the magnetic compass-needle and the concept of true north.[17][76][77] He wrote that steel needles were magnetized once they were rubbed with lodestone, and that they were put in floating position or in mountings; he described the suspended compass as the best form to be used, and noted that the magnetic needle of compasses pointed either south or north.[74][78] Shen Kuo asserted that the needle will point south but with a deviation,[78] stating [the magnetic needles] are always displaced slightly east rather than pointing due south.[74]</p><p>Shen Kuo wrote that it was preferable to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points — and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death.[6] The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the pole star and true north;[6] however, it could also have been inspired by geomantic beliefs and practices.[6] The book of the author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation.[77][79] However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time the compass might have already been in navigational use.[79] In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of the compass for seafaring navigation.</p><h3>Archaeology</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Further information: Song Dynasty §&nbsp;Archaeology</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/CMOC_Treasures_of_Ancient_China_exhibit_-_bronze_zun.jpg/170px-CMOC_Treasures_of_Ancient_China_exhibit_-_bronze_zun.jpg" width="170" height="233"><p>

		</p><p>
			Many of Shen Kuo's contemporaries were interested in antiquarian pursuits of collecting old artworks.[81] They were also interested in archaeological pursuits, although for rather different reasons than why Shen Kuo held an interest in archaeology. While Shen's educated Confucian contemporaries were interested in obtaining ancient relics and antiques in order to revive their use in rituals, Shen was more concerned with how items from archeological finds were originally manufactured and what their functionality would have been, based on empirical evidence.[82] Shen Kuo criticized those in his day who reconstructed ancient ritual objects using only their imagination and not the tangible evidence from archeological digs or finds.[82] Shen also disdained the notion of others that these objects were products of the sages or the aristocratic class of antiquity, rightfully crediting the items' manufacture and production to the common working people and artisans of previous eras.[82] Fraser and Haber write that Shen Kuo advocated the use of an interdisciplinary approach to archaeology and practiced such an approach himself through his work in metallurgy, optics, and geometry in the study of ancient measures.[82]</p><p>While working in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's interest in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models as well as from ancient texts that could provide additional information.[82] Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments.[82] He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel.[82] Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle.[82] In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.[83]</p><p>After unearthing an ancient crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen discovered that the cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, could be used to calculate the height of a distant mountain in the same way that mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height.[84] Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321.[85] Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end.[84] He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.[84]</p><h3>Geology</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/TaihangMountain8.jpg/170px-TaihangMountain8.jpg" width="170" height="182"><p>

			The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC) wrote in his Meteorology of how the earth had the potential for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC–480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind several times in the past, but never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores.[86] Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills.[87] The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands.[87] The later Persian Muslim scholar Abu Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.[88]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Likan_Bamboo_and_Rocks.jpg/170px-Likan_Bamboo_and_Rocks.jpg" width="170" height="208"><p>


		Bamboo and rocks by Li Kan (1244–1320); using evidence of fossilized bamboo within China's dry northwestern climate zone, Shen Kuo hypothesized that climates naturally shifted geographically over time.


		</p><p>
			It was Shen Kuo who formulated a hypothesis about the process of land formation (geomorphology) based upon several observations as evidence. This included his observation of fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by erosion of the mountains, uplift, and the deposition of silt, after observing strange natural erosions of the Taihang Mountains and the Yandang Mountain near Wenzhou.[89] He hypothesized that, with the inundation of silt, the land of the continent must have been formed over an enormous span of time.[90] While visiting the Taihang Mountains in 1074, Shen Kuo noticed strata of bivalve shells and ovoid rocks in a horizontal-running span through a cliff like a large belt.[90] Shen proposed that the cliff was once the location of an ancient seashore that by his time had shifted hundreds of miles east.[90] Shen wrote that in the Zhiping reign period (1064–1067) a man of Zezhou unearthed an object in his garden that looked like a serpent or dragon, and after examining it, concluded the dead animal had apparently turned to stone.[91][92] The magistrate of Jincheng, Zheng Boshun, examined the creature as well, and noted the same scale-like markings that were seen on other marine animals.[91][92] Shen Kuo likened this to the stone crabs found in China.[91][92]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a climatic area where they had never been known to be grown, the climate there must have shifted geographically over time.[93] Around the year 1080, Shen Kuo noted that a landslide on the bank of a large river near Yanzhou (modern Yan'an) had revealed an open space several dozens of feet under the ground once the bank collapsed.[93] This underground space contained hundreds of petrified bamboos still intact with roots and trunks, all turned to stone as Shen Kuo wrote.[93] Shen Kuo noted that bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou, located in northern China, and he was puzzled during which previous dynasty the bamboos could have grown.[93] Considering that damp and gloomy low places provide suitable conditions for the growth of bamboo, Shen deduced that the climate of Yanzhou must have fit that description in very ancient times.[93] Although this would have intrigued many of his readers, the study of paleoclimatology in medieval China never developed into an established discipline.</p><p>The philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) wrote of this curious natural phenomenon of fossils as well. He was known to have read the works of Shen Kuo.[92] Shen's description of soil erosion and weathering predated that of Georgius Agricola in his book of 1546, De veteribus et novis metallis.[94] Furthermore, Shen's theory of sedimentary deposition predated that of James Hutton, who published his groundbreaking work in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology).[94] Historian Joseph Needham likened Shen's account to that of the Scottish scientist Roderick Murchison (1792–1871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide.</p><h3>Meteorology</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Double-Rainbow.jpg/220px-Double-Rainbow.jpg" width="220" height="107"><p>

			Early speculation and hypothesis pertaining to what is now known as meteorology had a long tradition in China before Shen Kuo.[95]</p><p>Shen wrote vivid descriptions of tornadoes—the first known description of them in East Asia.</p><p>He also gave reasoning (earlier proposed by Sun Sikong, 1015–1076) that rainbows were formed by the shadow of the sun in rain, occurring when the sun would shine upon it.[96][97][98] Paul Dong writes that Shen's explanation of the rainbow as a phenomenon of atmospheric refraction is basically in accord with modern scientific principles.[99] In Europe, Roger Bacon (1214–1294) was the first to suggest that the colors of the rainbow were caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight through rain drops.[73]</p><p>Shen hypothesized that rays of sunlight refract before reaching the surface of the earth, hence people on earth observing the sun are not viewing it in its exact position, in other words, the altitude of the apparent sun is higher than the actual altitude of the sun.[99] Dong writes that at the time, this discovery was remarkably original.[99] Ibn al-Haytham, in his Book of Optics (1021), also discussed atmospheric refraction (in regard to twilight).[73]</p><h3>Astronomy and instruments</h3><p> Further information: Chinese astronomy</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Su_Song_Star_Map_1.JPG/220px-Su_Song_Star_Map_1.JPG" width="220" height="158"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock.[100] For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.[100] Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely.[100] This came about due to the position of the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees.[100] Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at -350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.[101]</p><p>The astronomical phenomena of the solar eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun.[102] The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that the brightness of the Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun.[103] Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat.[104] Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies.[105] However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century.[106] When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon.[105] Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun).[105] He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full.[105] He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical.[99][105] He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.[105][107]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Clock_Tower_from_Su_Song%27s_Book_desmear.JPG/170px-Clock_Tower_from_Su_Song%27s_Book_desmear.JPG" width="170" height="256"><p>

			Shen is also known for his cosmological hypotheses in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including retrogradation.[108] His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean Sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent Sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase.[109] Shen's hypotheses were similar to the concept of the epicycle in the Greco-Roman tradition,[108] only Shen compared the side-section of orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a willow leaf.[110][111] In a similar rudimentary physical analogy of celestial motions, as John B. Henderson describes it, Shen likened the relationship of the Moon's path to the ecliptic, the path of the Sun, to the figure of a rope coiled about a tree.[111]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations three times a night for a continuum of five years.[9] The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved into a state of considerable error.[9] Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements.[111] Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years.[9] The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate.[112] They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs.[113] When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors.[112][114] Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions.[23] Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.[113]</p><h3>Movable type printing</h3><p> Main article: History of typography in East Asia</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Jingangjing.jpg/220px-Jingangjing.jpg" width="220" height="154"><p>

			Shen Kuo wrote that during the Qingli reign period (1041–1048), under Emperor Renzong of Song (1022–1063), an obscure commoner and artisan known as Bi Sheng (990–1051) invented ceramic movable type printing.[115][116] Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose a piece of text had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient.[115] Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime.[117] Although the details of Bi Sheng's life were scarcely known, Shen Kuo wrote:</p><p>When Bi Sheng died, his fount of type passed into the possession of my followers (i.e. one of Shen's nephews), among whom it has been kept as a precious possession until now.[2][118]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Chinese_movable_type_1313-ce.png/170px-Chinese_movable_type_1313-ce.png" width="170" height="170"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			There are a few surviving examples of books printed in the late Song Dynasty using movable type printing.[119] This includes Zhou Bida's Notes of The Jade Hall (????) printed in 1193 using the method of baked-clay movable type characters outlined in the Dream Pool Essays.[120] Yao Shu (1201–1278), an advisor to Kublai Khan, once persuaded a disciple Yang Gu to print philological primers and Neo-Confucian texts by using what he termed the movable type of Shen Kuo.[121] Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333), who wrote the valuable agricultural, scientific, and technological treatise of the Nong Shu, mentioned an alternative method of baking earthenware type with earthenware frames in order to make whole blocks.[121] Wang Zhen also improved its use by inventing wooden movable type in the years 1297 or 1298, while he was a magistrate of Jingde, Anhui province.[122] The earlier Bi Sheng had experimented with wooden movable type,[123] but Wang's main contribution was improving the speed of typesetting with simple mechanical devices, along with the complex, systematic arrangement of wooden movable type involving the use of revolving tables.[124] Although later metal movable type would be used in China, Wang Zhen experimented with tin metal movable type, but found its use to be inefficient.[125]</p><p>By the 15th century, metal movable type printing was developed in Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century.[126] In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490.[127] In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware.[121] There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.[121]</p><p>Despite these advances, movable type printing never gained the amount of widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory.[115] Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.</p><h3>Other achievements in science and technology</h3><p>Shen Kuo described the phenomena of natural predator insects controlling the population of pests, the latter of which had the potential to wreak havoc upon the agricultural base of China.[128]</p><p>While visiting the iron producing district at Cizhou in 1075, Shen described the partial decarburization method of reforging cast iron under a cold blast, which Hartwell, Needham, and Wertime state is the predecessor of the Bessemer process.[129] Shen was worried about deforestationg[›] due to the needs of the iron industry and ink makers using pine soot in the production process, so he suggested for the latter an alternative of petroleum, which he believed was produced inexhaustibly within the earth.[96][130] Shen used the soot from the smoke of burned petroleum fuel (?? Shíyóu, rock oil as Shen called it) to invent a new, more durable type of writing ink; the Ming Dynasty pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518–1593) wrote that Shen's ink was lustrous like lacquer, and superior to that made from pinewood lamp-black, or the soot from pinewood.[131][132]</p><h3>Beliefs and philosophy</h3><p> Further information: Chinese philosophy</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Mencius2.jpg/170px-Mencius2.jpg" width="170" height="258"><p>


		Ideas of the philosopher Mencius deeply influenced Shen.


		</p><p>
			Shen Kuo was much in favor of philosophical Daoist notions which challenged the authority of empirical science in his day. Although much could be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings.[133] Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist I Ching in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through crude traces, which he likens to mathematical astronomy.[133] Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them, which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of Heraclitus, Plato, and Democritus as well.[134] Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them.[135] Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained.[136] When describing an event where lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and lacquerwares inside were fine, yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote:</p><p>Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.[137]</p><p>In his commentary on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote of the importance of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience.[72] In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance.[72] Along with his commentary on the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.[138]</p><h3>Art criticism</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Dong_Yuan_Mountain_Hall.jpg/170px-Dong_Yuan_Mountain_Hall.jpg" width="170" height="255"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			As an art critic, Shen criticized the paintings of Li Cheng (919–967) for failing to observe the principle of seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large in portraying buildings and the like.[139] He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934–c. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong's work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery.[140][141][142] In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting.[143] In his Song on Painting and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701–761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity, but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.[144][145][146]</p><h2>Written works</h2><p>Much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies.[147] For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.[148]</p><p>In modern times, the best attempt at a complete list and summary of Shen's writing was an appendix written by Hu Daojing in his standard edition of Brush Talks, written in 1956.[149]</p><h3>D<br>
					

									 
								

					</h3><br><h1 lang="en">Ibn al-Haytham</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Abu ?Ali al-?asan ibn al-?asan ibn al-Haytham (Arabic: ??? ???? ????? ?? ????? ?? ???????? c.?965&nbsp;– c.?1040&nbsp;CE), also known by the Latinization Alhazen or Alhacen,[10] was an Arab[11] Muslim[12][13][14] scientist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher.[15] Ibn al-Haytham made significant contributions to the principles of optics, astronomy, mathematics and visual perception.[16] .He is considered to be the father of optics. He was the first to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes.[17] He spent most of his life close to the court of the Fatimid Caliphate in Cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities.[18]</p><p>Ibn al-Haytham is widely considered to be one of the first theoretical physicists, and an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence—hence understanding the scientific method 200 years before Renaissance scientists.[19][20][21][22][23][24]</p><p>In medieval Europe, Ibn al-Haytham was honored as Ptolemaeus Secundus (the Second Ptolemy)[25] or simply called The Physicist.[26] He is also sometimes called al-Ba?ri after his birthplace, Basra in Iraq,[27] or al-Mi?ri (of Egypt).[28]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Overview</h2><h3>Biography</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was born c. 965 in Basra, which was then part of the Buyid emirate,[29] to an Arab family.[30] Alhazen arrived in Cairo under the reign of Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim, a patron of the sciences who was particularly interested in astronomy.[31] He proposed to the Caliph a hydraulic project to improve regulation of the flooding of the Nile, a task requiring an early attempt at building a dam at the present site of the Aswan Dam,[32] but later his field work convinced him of the technical impracticality of this scheme.[33] Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous University of al-Azhar, until his death in 1040.[34] Legend has it that after deciding the scheme was impractical and fearing the caliph's anger, Alhazen feigned madness and was kept under house arrest from 1011 until al-Hakim's death in 1021.[35] During this time, he wrote his influential Book of Optics and continued to write further treatises on astronomy, geometry, number theory, optics and natural philosophy.[36]</p><p>Among his students were Sorkhab (Sohrab), a Persian from Semnan who was his student for over three years, and Abu al-Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek, an Egyptian prince who learned mathematics from Alhazen.[37]</p><h3>Legacy</h3><p>Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment.</p><p>His main work, Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics), was known in the Muslim world mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by Kamal al-Din al-Farisi, the Tanqi? al-Mana?ir li-dhawi l-ab?ar wa l-ba?a'ir.[38] In al-Andalus, it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the Banu Hud dynasty of Zaragossa and author of an important mathematical text, al-Mu'taman ibn Hud. A Latin translation of the Kitab al-Manazir was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.[39] This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: Roger Bacon,[40] Robert Grosseteste,[41] Witelo, Giambattista della Porta,[42] Leonardo Da Vinci,[43] Galileo Galilei,[44] Christiaan Huygens,[45] René Descartes,[46] and Johannes Kepler.[47] His research in catoptrics (the study of optical systems using mirrors) centred on spherical and parabolic mirrors and spherical aberration. He made the observation that the ratio between the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant, and investigated the magnifying power of a lens. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as Alhazen's problem.[48] Meanwhile in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced Averroes' writings on optics,[49] and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his Optics by Persian scientist Kamal al-Din al-Farisi (died ca. 1320) in the latter's Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir (The Revision of [Ibn al-Haytham's] Optics).[50] Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on cosmology were translated into Latin, Hebrew and other languages. The crater Alhazen on the Moon is named in his honour,[51] as was the asteroid 59239 Alhazen.[52] In honour of Alhazen, the Aga Khan University (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology.[53] Alhazen, by the name Ibn al-Haytham, is featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000-dinar banknote issued in 2003,[54] and on 10-dinar notes from 1982.</p><p>The 2015 International Year of Light celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.[55]</p><h2>Book of Optics</h2><p> Main article: Book of Optics</p><p>Alhazen's most famous work[56] is his seven-volume treatise on optics Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics), written from 1011 to 1021.</p><p>Optics was translated into Latin by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.[57] It was printed by Friedrich Risner in 1572, with the title Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus (English&nbsp;: Thesaurus of Optics: seven books of the Arab Alhazeni, first edition: concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds).[58] Risner is also the author of the name variant Alhazen; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen, which is the correct transcription of the Arabic name.[59] This work enjoyed a great reputation during the Middle Ages. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and one in the library of Bruges.[60]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Theory of vision</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg/220px-Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg" width="220" height="242"><p>

			Two major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity. The first theory, the emission theory, was supported by such thinkers as Euclid and Ptolemy, who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by Aristotle and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as al-Kindi) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the Book of Optics was from Ptolemy's Optics, while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.[61] Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of Galen, and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point.[62] This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.[63] He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.[64] He later asserted (in book seven of the Optics) that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived as if perpendicular.[65]</p><p>His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why only perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?[66] His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.[67] However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: Directly or indirectly, his De Aspectibus inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.[68] Kepler's later theory of the retinal image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.[69]</p><p>Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with lenses, mirrors, refraction, and reflection.[70] His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.[71]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The camera obscura was known to the ancient Chinese, and was described by the Han Chinese polymathic genius Shen Kuo in his scientific book Dream Pool Essays, published in the year 1088 C.E.. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his Problems, however Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of China, of camera obscura in the areas of the middle east, Europe, Africa and India.[72] and early analysis[73] of the device.</p><p>Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the visual system. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 Perception article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century Hering's law of equal innervation. He wrote a description of vertical horopters 600 years before Aguilonius that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's—and his work on binocular disparity was repeated by Panum in 1858.[74] Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from Ptolemy, who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.[75] In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.[76] In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune[77] and Sabra,[78] Raynaud[79] showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.</p><p>Alhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.[80] His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,[81] which he sought to avoid.[82] He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.[83] He followed Galen in believing that the lens was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the retina was also involved.[84]</p><p>Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.[85]</p><h3>Scientific method</h3><p>The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and ... attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.</p><p>An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (i'tibar)(Arabic: ??????) and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries. Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (ilm tabi'i) with mathematics (ta'alim; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in Kitab al-Manazir (The Optics; De aspectibus or Perspectivae) and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).[87]</p><p>According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.[88] G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view,[89] arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his Book of Optics had not yet been fully translated from Arabic. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.[90] Toomer does concede that Schramm sums up [Alhazen's] achievement in the development of scientific method.[91]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Mark Smith recounts Alhazen's elaboration of Ptolemy's experiments in double vision, reflection, and refraction: Alhazen's Optics book influenced the Perspectivists in Europe, Roger Bacon, Witelo, and Peckham.

		The theorem of Ibn Haytham


		</p><p>
			His work on catoptrics in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by Ptolemy in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the circumference and making equal angles with the normal at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer. This leads to an equation of the fourth degree.[94] This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of fourth powers, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an integration, where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.[95] Alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic sections and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used Descartes' analytical methods to analyse the problem,[96] with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician Peter M. Neumann.[97] Recently, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.[98] They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.[99] Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.[100]</p><h3>Other contributions</h3><br><img alt="Frontispiece of book showing two persons in robes, one holding a geometrical diagram, the other holding a telescope." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Houghton_Typ_620.47.452_-_Selenographia%2C_title.jpg/220px-Houghton_Typ_620.47.452_-_Selenographia%2C_title.jpg" width="220" height="357"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that only the impact of perpendicular projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect oblique projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.[101] He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.[102]</p><p>Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of experimental psychology, for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and optical illusions.[103] Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the founder of psychophysics, a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.[104] Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.[105]</p><p>Alhazen offered an explanation of the Moon illusion, an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.[106] Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by Roger Bacon, John Pecham and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.[107] Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. Cleomedes (c. 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to Posidonius (c. 135-50 BC).[108] Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his Optics, but the text is obscure.[109] Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.</p><h2>Other works on physics</h2><h3>Optical treatises</h3><p>Besides the Book of Optics, Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his Risala fi l-Daw’ (Treatise on Light). He investigated the properties of luminance, the rainbow, eclipses, twilight, and moonlight. Experiments with mirrors and magnifying lenses provided the foundation for his theories on catoptrics.[110]</p><h3>Celestial physics</h3><p>Alhazen discussed the physics of the celestial region in his Epitome of Astronomy, arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred Ptolemaic model greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West. Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses were accountable to the laws of physics, and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.[111]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>He also wrote Maqala fi daw al-qamar (On the Light of the Moon).</p><h3>Mechanics</h3><p>In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the motion of a body.[112] In his Treatise on Place, Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle's view that nature abhors a void, and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[113]</p><h2>Astronomical works</h2><h3>On the Configuration of the World</h3><p>In his On the Configuration of the World Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:</p><p>The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.[114]</p><p>The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's Almagest, which was eventually translated into Hebrew and Latin in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as Georg von Peuerbach[115] during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance.[116]</p><h3>Doubts Concerning Ptolemy</h3><p>In his Al-Shukuk ?ala Batlamyus, variously translated as Doubts Concerning Ptolemy or Aporias against Ptolemy, published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized Ptolemy's Almagest, Planetary Hypotheses, and Optics, pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's Almagest concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the Hypotheses concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.[117] He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the equant, failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:[118]</p><p>Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (hay'a) that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist... [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.[119]</p><p>Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a true configuration of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.[120] In the Doubts Concerning Ptolemy Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:</p><p>Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...[121]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.</p><h3>Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets</h3><p>Alhazen's The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets was written c. 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his Doubts on Ptolemy, Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of epicycles to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's equant. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.[122]</p><h3>Other astronomical works</h3><p>Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as Exact Determination of the Meridian, a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the Milky Way; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.[123] The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the Doubts and Model of the Motions discussed above.[124]</p><h2>Mathematical works</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/AlhazenSummation.png/150px-AlhazenSummation.png" width="150" height="161"><p>


		Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula


		</p><p>
			In mathematics, Alhazen built on the mathematical works of Euclid and Thabit ibn Qurra and worked on the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry.[125]</p><p>He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.[126]</p><h3>Geometry</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/LunesOfAlhazen.svg/220px-LunesOfAlhazen.svg.png" width="220" height="241"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The lunes of Alhazen. The two blue lunes together have the same area as the green right triangle.


		</p><p>
			Alhazen explored what is now known as the Euclidean parallel postulate, the fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements, using a proof by contradiction,[127] and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.[128] He formulated the Lambert quadrilateral, which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral.[129]</p><p>In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.[130] The two lunes formed from a right triangle by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the lunes of Alhazen; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.[131]</p><h3>Number theory</h3><p>Alhazen's contributions to number theory include his work on perfect numbers. In his Analysis and Synthesis, he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2n-1(2n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1) where 2n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 is prime, but he was not able to prove this result; Euler later proved it in the 18th century.[132]</p><p>Alhazen solved problems involving congruences using what is now called Wilson's theorem. In his Opuscula, Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the Chinese remainder theorem.[133]</p><h3>Calculus</h3><p>Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a paraboloid. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.[134]</p><h2>Other works</h2><h3>Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals</h3><p>Alhazen also wrote a Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals, although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.</p><h3>Engineering</h3><p>In engineering, one account of his career as a civil engineer has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, to regulate the flooding of the Nile River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual inundation of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a dam, at the site of the modern-day Aswan Dam. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon feigned madness so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.[135]</p><h3>Philosophy</h3><p>In his Treatise on Place, Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle's view that nature abhors a void, and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[136] Abd-el-latif, a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan (A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place) for its geometrization of place.[137]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Alhazen also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his Book of Optics. In tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.[138]</p><h3>Theology</h3><p>Alhazen was a devout Muslim, though it is uncertain which branch of Islam he followed. He may have been either a follower of the Ash'ari school of Sunni Islamic theology according to Ziauddin Sardar[139] and Lawrence Bettany[140] (and opposed to the views of the Mu'tazili school),[141] a follower of the Mu'tazili school of Islamic theology according to Peter Edward Hodgson,[142] or a possibly follower of Shia Islam according to A. I. Sabra.[143][need quotation to verify]</p><p>Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.[144] He also wrote a treatise entitled Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation in which he discussed finding the Qibla, where Salat prayers are directed towards, mathematically.[145]</p><p>He wrote in his Doubts Concerning Ptolemy:</p><p>Truth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...[146]</p><p>In The Winding Motion, Alhazen further wrote:</p><p>From the statements made by the noble Shaykh, it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (taqlid); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.[147]</p><p>Alhazen described his theology:</p><p>I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the effulgence and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.[148]</p><h2>List of works</h2><p>According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.[149] Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.[150]</p><li>Book of Optics (???? ??????? )</li><li>Analysis and Synthesis (????? ?? ??????? ????????)</li><li>Balance of Wisdom (????? ??????. )</li><li>Corrections to the Almagest (??????? ??? ???????. )</li><li>Discourse on Place (????? ?? ??????. )</li><li>Exact Determination of the Pole (??????? ?????? ?????)</li><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><li>Exact Determination of the Meridian (????? ?? ?????)</li><li>Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation (????? ???? ????? ??????)</li><li>Horizontal Sundials (??????? ???????)</li><li>Hour Lines</li><li>Doubts Concerning Ptolemy (???? ??? ???????.)</li><li>Maqala fi'l-Qarastun (????? ?? ??????)</li><li>On Completion of the Conics (????? ???????? )</li><li>On Seeing the Stars (???? ??????? )</li><li>On Squaring the Circle (????? ?? ????? ??????? )</li><li>On the Burning Sphere ( ??????? ??????? ????????)</li><li>On the Configuration of the World (????? ??????.-)</li><li>On the Form of Eclipse (????? ?? ???? ???????-)</li><li>On the Light of Stars (????? ?? ??? ?????? - )</li><li>On the Light of the Moon (????? ?? ??? ?????)</li><li>On the Milky Way (????? ?? ??? ???????.)</li><li>On the Nature of Shadows (?????? ???????)</li><li>On the Rainbow and Halo (????? ?? ??? ???)</li><li>Opuscula</li><li>Resolution of Doubts Concerning the Almagest</li><li>Resolution of Doubts Concerning the Winding Motion</li><li>The Correction of the Operations in Astronomy</li><li>The Different Heights of the Planets</li><li>The Direction of Mecca (????? ??????)</li><li>The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets (????? ????? ??????? ??????)</li><li>The Model of the Universe (????? ?????)</li><li>The Motion of the Moon (???? ?????)</li><li>The Ratios of Hourly Arcs to their Heights</li><li>The Winding Motion (?????? ????????)</li><li>Treatise on Light (????? ?? ?????)</li><li>Treatise on Place (????? ?? ??????)</li><li>Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals (????? ?????? ????????? ?? ?????? ????????? )</li><li>(???? ?? ????? ??????? ???????? )</li><li>(?????? ?? ???? ??????)</li><li>??? ?? ????? ?????.</li><li>????? ??????? ??????? ?? ???? ?????????)</li><li>???? ?????? ?? ??? ??????.)</li><li>????? ?? ????? ?????? ???????</li><li>??? ???? ??????</li><li>??????? ??????? ???????</li><h3>Lost works</h3><li>A Book in which I have Summarized the Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book[151]</li><h2>Commemorations</h2><p>Ibn Al-Haytham's work has been commemorated by the naming of the Alhazen crater on the moon after him.

Smith shows that Alhacen was received well in the West because he reinforced the importance of the Hellenic tradition to them.[153]</p><h3>Refraction</h3><p>Smith (2010) has noted that Alhazen's treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data.[154] Ptolemy published his experimental results for refraction, in contrast. One generation before Alhazen, Ibn Sahl discovered his statement of the lengths of the hypotenuse for each incident and refracted right triangle, respectively. This is equivalent to Descartes' formulation for refraction. Alhazen's convention for describing the incident and refracted angles is still in use.</p><h2>In literature</h2><p>Ibn al-Haytham is the main character in The Prisoner of Al-Hakim by American novelist Bradley Steffens, which recounts the scholar's journey to Egypt, his ten-year imprisonment under Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and his major discoveries in the field of optics.[155]</p><h2>Notes</h2><h2>Sources</h2><h3>Primary</h3><h3>Secondary</h3><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ibn_al-Haytham&amp;oldid=784155218"

Photographic processing transforms the latent image into a visible image, makes this permanent and renders it insensitive to light.




		</p><li>The film may be soaked in water to swell the gelatin layer, facilitating the action of the subsequent chemical treatments.</li><li>The developer converts the latent image to macroscopic particles of metallic silver.[3]</li><li>A stop bath,† typically a dilute solution of acetic acid or citric acid, halts the action of the developer. A rinse with clean water may be substituted.</li><li>The fixer makes the image permanent and light-resistant by dissolving remaining silver halide. A common fixer is hypo, specifically ammonium thiosulfate.[4]</li><li>Washing in clean water removes any remaining fixer. Residual fixer can corrode the silver image, leading to discolouration, staining and fading.[citation needed]</li><p>
			The washing time can be reduced and the fixer more completely removed if a hypo clearing agent is used after the fixer.</p><li>Film may be rinsed in a dilute solution of a non-ionic wetting agent to assist uniform drying, which eliminates drying marks caused by hard water. (In very hard water areas, a pre-rinse in distilled water may be required - otherwise the final rinse wetting agent can cause residual ionic calcium on the film to drop out of solution, causing spotting on the negative.)</li><li>Film is then dried in a dust-free environment, cut and placed into protective sleeves.</li><p>Once the film is processed, it is then referred to as a negative.</p><p>The negative may now be printed; the negative is placed in an enlarger and projected onto a sheet of photographic paper. Many different techniques can be used during the enlargement process. Two examples of enlargement techniques are dodging and burning.</p><p>Alternatively (or as well), the negative may be scanned for digital printing or web viewing after adjustment, retouching, and/or manipulation.</p><p>† In modern automatic processing machines, the stop bath is replaced by mechanical squeegee or pinching rollers. These treatments remove much of the carried-over alkaline developer, and the acid, when used, neutralizes the alkalinity to reduce the contamination of the fixing bath with the developer.</p><h3>Black and white reversal processing</h3><p>This process has three additional stages:</p><li>Following the stop bath, the film is bleached to remove the developed negative image. The film then contains a latent positive image formed from unexposed and undeveloped silver halide salts.</li><li>The film is fogged, either chemically or by exposure to light.</li><li>The remaining silver halide salts are developed in the second developer, converting them into a positive image.</li><li>Finally, the film is fixed, washed, dried and cut.[5]</li><h3>Colour processing</h3><p>Chromogenic materials use dye couplers to form colour images. Modern colour negative film is developed with the C-41 process and colour negative print materials with the RA-4 process. These processes are very similar, with differences in the first chemical developer.</p><p>The C-41 and RA-4 processes consist of the following steps:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><li>The colour developer develops the silver negative image, and byproducts activate the dye couplers to form the colour dyes in each emulsion layer.</li><li>A rehalogenising bleach converts the developed silver image into silver halides.</li><li>A fixer removes the silver salts.</li><li>The film is washed, stabilised, dried and cut.[6]</li><p>In the RA-4 process, the bleach and fix are combined. This is optional, and reduces the number of processing steps.[7]</p><p>Transparency films, except Kodachrome, are developed using the E-6 process, which has the following stages:</p><li>A black and white developer develops the silver in each image layer.</li><li>Development is stopped with a rinse or a stop bath.</li><li>The film is fogged in the reversal step.</li><li>The fogged silver halides are developed and oxidized developing agents couple with the dye couplers in each layer.</li><li>The film is bleached, fixed, stabilised and dried as described above.[6]</li><p>In some old processes, the film emulsion was hardened during the process, typically before the bleach. Such a hardening bath often used aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. In modern processing, these hardening steps are unnecessary because the film emulsion is sufficiently hardened to withstand the processing chemicals.</p><h2>Further processing</h2><p>Black and white emulsions both negative and positive, may be further processed. The image silver may be reacted with elements such as selenium or sulphur to increase image permanence and for aesthetic reasons. This process is known as toning.</p><p>In selenium toning, the image silver is changed to silver selenide; in sepia toning, the image is converted to silver sulphide. These chemicals are more resistant to atmospheric oxidising agents than silver.</p><p>If colour negative film is processed in conventional black and white developer, and fixed and then bleached with a bath containing hydrochloric acid and potassium dichromate solution, the resultant film, once exposed to light, can be redeveloped in colour developer to produce an unusual pastel colour effect.[citation needed]</p><h2>Processing apparatus</h2><p>Before processing, the film must be removed from the camera and from its cassette, spool or holder in a light-proof room or container.</p><h3>Small scale processing</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Light_trap_tank.jpg/200px-Light_trap_tank.jpg" width="200" height="171"><p>

			In amateur processing, the film is removed from the camera and wound onto a reel in complete darkness (usually inside a darkroom with the safelight turned off or a lightproof bag with arm holes). The reel holds the film in a spiral shape, with space between each successive loop so the chemicals may flow freely across the film's surfaces. The reel is placed in a specially designed light-proof tank (called daylight processing tank or a light-trap tank) where it is retained until final washing is complete.</p><p>Sheet films can be processed in trays, in hangers (which are used in deep tanks), or rotary processing drums. Each sheet can be developed individually for special requirements. Stand development, long development in dilute developer without agitation, is occasionally used.</p><h3>Commercial processing</h3><p>In commercial processing, the film is removed automatically or by an operator handling the film in a light proof bag from which it is fed into the processing machine. The processing machinery is generally run on a continuous basis with films spliced together in a continuous line. All the processing steps are carried out within a single processing machine with automatically controlled time, temperature and solution replenishment rate. The film or prints emerge washed and dry and ready to be cut by hand. Some modern machines also cut films and prints automatically, sometimes resulting in negatives cut across the middle of the frame where the space between frames is very thin or the frame edge is indistinct, as in an image taken in low light.</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Photographic_processing&amp;oldid=784054259"

			Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) (pronunciation:/'r?d?ks/ or /'ri?d?ks/ [1]) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, two key concepts involved with electron transfer processes.[2] Redox reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed; in general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between chemical species. The chemical species from which the electron is stripped is said to have been oxidized, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to have been reduced. It can be explained in simple terms:</p><p>As an example, during the combustion of wood, oxygen from the air is reduced, gaining electrons from the carbon.[3] Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation of oxides from oxygen molecules, oxygen is not necessarily included in such reactions, as other chemical species can serve the same function.[3]</p><p>The reaction can occur relatively slowly, as in the case of rust, or more quickly, as in the case of fire. There are simple redox processes, such as the oxidation of carbon to yield carbon dioxide (CO2) or the reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane (CH4), and more complex processes such as the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6) in the human body.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Redox is a portmanteau of reduction and oxidation.</p><p>The word oxidation originally implied reaction with oxygen to form an oxide, since dioxygen (O2 (g)) was historically the first recognized oxidizing agent. Later, the term was expanded to encompass oxygen-like substances that accomplished parallel chemical reactions. Ultimately, the meaning was generalized to include all processes involving loss of electrons.</p><p>The word reduction originally referred to the loss in weight upon heating a metallic ore such as a metal oxide to extract the metal. In other words, ore was reduced to metal. Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) showed that this loss of weight was due to the loss of oxygen as a gas. Later, scientists realized that the metal atom gains electrons in this process. The meaning of reduction then became generalized to include all processes involving gain of electrons. Even though reduction seems counter-intuitive when speaking of the gain of electrons, it might help to think of reduction as the loss of oxygen, which was its historical meaning. Since electrons are negatively charged, it is also helpful to think of this as reduction in electrical charge.</p><p>The electrochemist John Bockris has used the words electronation and deelectronation to describe reduction and oxidation processes respectively when they occur at electrodes.[4] These words are analogous to protonation and deprotonation, but they have not been widely adopted by chemists.</p><p>The term hydrogenation could be used instead of reduction, since hydrogen is the reducing agent in a large number of reactions, especially in organic chemistry and biochemistry. But, unlike oxidation, which has been generalized beyond its root element, hydrogenation has maintained its specific connection to reactions that add hydrogen to another substance (e.g., the hydrogenation of unsaturated fats into saturated fats, R-CH=CH-R + H2 ? R-CH2-CH2-R). The word redox was first used in 1928.[5]</p><h2>Definitions</h2><p>The processes of oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously and cannot happen independently of one another, similar to the acid–base reaction.[3] The oxidation alone and the reduction alone are each called a half-reaction, because two half-reactions always occur together to form a whole reaction. When writing half-reactions, the gained or lost electrons are typically included explicitly in order that the half-reaction be balanced with respect to electric charge.</p><p>Though sufficient for many purposes, these general descriptions are not precisely correct. Although oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation state — the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. The oxidation state of an atom is the fictitious charge that an atom would have if all bonds between atoms of different elements were 100% ionic. Thus, oxidation is best defined as an increase in oxidation state, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always cause a change in oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as redox even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).</p><h2>Oxidizing and reducing agents</h2><p>In redox processes, the reductant transfers electrons to the oxidant. Thus, in the reaction, the reductant or reducing agent loses electrons and is oxidized, and the oxidant or oxidizing agent gains electrons and is reduced. The pair of an oxidizing and reducing agent that are involved in a particular reaction is called a redox pair. A redox couple is a reducing species and its corresponding oxidizing form, e.g., Fe2+/Fe3+.</p><h3>Oxidizers</h3><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/GHS-pictogram-rondflam.svg/220px-GHS-pictogram-rondflam.svg.png" width="220" height="220"><p>

			 Main article: Oxidizing agent</p><p>Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances (cause them to lose electrons) are said to be oxidative or oxidizing and are known as oxidizing agents, oxidants, or oxidizers. That is, the oxidant (oxidizing agent) removes electrons from another substance, and is thus itself reduced. And, because it accepts electrons, the oxidizing agent is also called an electron acceptor. Oxygen is the quintessential oxidizer.</p><p>Oxidants are usually chemical substances with elements in high oxidation states (e.g., H
		2O
		2, MnO-
		4, CrO
		3, Cr
		2O2-
		7, OsO
		4), or else highly electronegative elements (O2, F2, Cl2, Br2) that can gain extra electrons by oxidizing another substance.</p><h3>Reducers</h3><p> Main article: Reducing agent</p><p>Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances (cause them to gain electrons) are said to be reductive or reducing and are known as reducing agents, reductants, or reducers. The reductant (reducing agent) transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus itself oxidized. And, because it donates electrons, the reducing agent is also called an electron donor. Electron donors can also form charge transfer complexes with electron acceptors.</p><p>Reductants in chemistry are very diverse. Electropositive elemental metals, such as lithium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and aluminium, are good reducing agents. These metals donate or give away electrons readily. Hydride transfer reagents, such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4, are widely used in organic chemistry,[6][7] primarily in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols. Another method of reduction involves the use of hydrogen gas (H2) with a palladium, platinum, or nickel catalyst. These catalytic reductions are used primarily in the reduction of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.</p><h2>Standard electrode potentials (reduction potentials)</h2><p>Each half-reaction has a standard electrode potential (E0

			Cathodic protection is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. A simple method of protection connects protected metal to a more easily corroded sacrificial anode to act as the anode. The sacrificial metal instead of the protected metal, then, corrodes. A common application of cathodic protection is in galvanized steel, in which a sacrificial coating of zinc on steel parts protects them from rust.</p><p>The primary process of reducing ore at high temperature to produce metals is known as smelting.</p><p>Oxidation is used in a wide variety of industries such as in the production of cleaning products and oxidizing ammonia to produce nitric acid, which is used in most fertilizers.</p><p>Redox reactions are the foundation of electrochemical cells, which can generate electrical energy or support electrosynthesis.</p><p>The process of electroplating uses redox reactions to coat objects with a thin layer of a material, as in chrome-plated automotive parts, silver plating cutlery, and gold-plated jewelry.</p><p>The production of compact discs depends on a redox reaction, which coats the disc with a thin layer of metal film.[clarification needed]</p><h2>Redox reactions in biology</h2><p>Many important biological processes involve redox reactions.</p><p>Cellular respiration, for instance, is the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6) to CO2 and the reduction of oxygen to water. The summary equation for cell respiration is:</p><p>The process of cell respiration also depends heavily on the reduction of NAD+ to NADH and the reverse reaction (the oxidation of NADH to NAD+). Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary, but photosynthesis is not the reverse of the redox reaction in cell respiration:</p><p>Biological energy is frequently stored and released by means of redox reactions. Photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide into sugars and the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen. The reverse reaction, respiration, oxidizes sugars to produce carbon dioxide and water. As intermediate steps, the reduced carbon compounds are used to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which then contributes to the creation of a proton gradient, which drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is maintained by the reduction of oxygen. In animal cells, mitochondria perform similar functions. See the Membrane potential article.</p><p>Free radical reactions are redox reactions that occur as a part of homeostasis and killing microorganisms, where an electron detaches from a molecule and then reattaches almost instantaneously. Free radicals are a part of redox molecules and can become harmful to the human body if they do not reattach to the redox molecule or an antioxidant. Unsatisfied free radicals can spur the mutation of cells they encounter and are, thus, causes of cancer.</p><p>The term redox state is often used to describe the balance of GSH/GSSG, NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH in a biological system such as a cell or organ. The redox state is reflected in the balance of several sets of metabolites (e.g., lactate and pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate), whose interconversion is dependent on these ratios. An abnormal redox state can develop in a variety of deleterious situations, such as hypoxia, shock, and sepsis. Redox mechanism also control some cellular processes. Redox proteins and their genes must be co-located for redox regulation according to the CoRR hypothesis for the function of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts.</p><h3>Redox cycling</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>A wide variety of aromatic compounds are enzymatically reduced to form free radicals that contain one more electron than their parent compounds. In general, the electron donor is any of a wide variety of flavoenzymes and their coenzymes. Once formed, these anion free radicals reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide, and regenerate the unchanged parent compound. The net reaction is the oxidation of the flavoenzyme's coenzymes and the reduction of molecular oxygen to form superoxide. This catalytic behavior has been described as futile cycle or redox cycling.</p><p>Examples of redox cycling-inducing molecules are the herbicide paraquat and other viologens and quinones such as menadione.[9]</p><h2>Redox reactions in geology</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/UraniumMineUtah.JPG/220px-UraniumMineUtah.JPG" width="220" height="165"><p>

			In geology, redox is important to both the formation of minerals and the mobilization of minerals, and is also important in some depositional environments. In general, the redox state of most rocks can be seen in the color of the rock. The rock forms in oxidizing conditions, giving it a red color. It is then bleached to a green—or sometimes white—form when a reducing fluid passes through the rock. The reduced fluid can also carry uranium-bearing minerals. Famous examples of redox conditions affecting geological processes include uranium deposits and Moqui marbles.</p><h2>Balancing redox reactions</h2><p>Describing the overall electrochemical reaction for a redox process requires a balancing of the component half-reactions for oxidation and reduction.

It is the hydrogen sulfate (HSO4-) salt of the protonated derivative of N-methylaminophenol. This colourless salt is a popular photographic developer used in black &amp; white photography.[1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Synthesis</h2><p>Several methods exist for the preparation of N-methylaminophenol. It arises by decarboxylation of N-4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Glycin). It can be obtained by reaction of hydroquinone with methylamine.[2]</p><h2>Application</h2><p>Metol is an excellent developing agent for most continuous tone developer applications, and it has been widely used in published developer formulas as well as commercial products. However, it is difficult to produce highly concentrated developer solutions using Metol, and therefore most Metol developers are supplied in dry chemical mix. A developer containing both Metol and hydroquinone is called an MQ developer. This combination of agents provide greater developer activity since the rate of development by both agents together is greater than the sum of rates of developments by each agent used alone (superadditivity). This combination is very versatile; by varying the quantities of Metol, hydroquinone, restrainer, and adjusting the pH, the entire range of continuous tone developers can be made. Therefore, Metol replaced most other developing agents except for hydroquinone, Phenidone (which is more recent than Metol), and derivatives of Phenidone. Notable formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer.</p><h2>History</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Alfred Bogisch, working for a chemical company owned by Julius Hauff, discovered in 1891 that methylated p-aminophenol has more vigorous developing action than p-aminophenol. Hauff introduced this compound as a developing agent. The exact composition of Bogisch and Hauff's early Metol is unknown, but it was most likely methylated at the ortho position of the benzene ring (p-amino-o-methylphenol), rather than at the amino group. Some time later, Metol came to mean the N-methylated variety, and the o-methylated variety fell out of use. Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation (AGFA) sold this compound under the trade name Metol, which became by far the most common name, followed by Eastman Kodak's trade name Elon.</p><p>Because it has been in use for this purpose for over 100 years, and often by amateur photographers, there is a substantial body of evidence regarding the health problems that contact with Metol can cause. These are principally local dermatitis of the hands and forearms. There is also some evidence of sensitization dermatitis, in which repeated exposure triggers of a chronic condition that is resistant to medication. The use of Metol in highly caustic solutions and the presence of other materials in darkrooms that have been implicated in dermatitis—such as hexavalent chromium salts—may exacerbate some health impacts.[citation needed]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metol&amp;oldid=770718006"

For the color, see Silver (color). For other uses, see Silver (disambiguation).</p><p>Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin argentum, derived from the Greek ????? (literally shiny or white), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *h2er?-, grey or shining. A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (native silver), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.</p><p>Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as 0.940 fine. As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.</p><p>Silver is used in numerous applications other than currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion). Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions. Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays.

		Silver is extremely ductile, and can be drawn into a monoatomic wire.[4]


		</p><p>
			Silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table, copper and gold. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Kr]4d105s1, similarly to copper ([Ar]3d104s1) and gold ([Xe]4f145d106s1); group 11 is one of the few groups in the d-block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations.[5] This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.[6]</p><p>Silver is an extremely soft, ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold.[7] Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.[8]</p><p>Silver has a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high polish,[9] and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a colour name.[6] Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385&nbsp;kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal.[6] Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450&nbsp;nm.[10] At wavelengths shorter than 450&nbsp;nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310&nbsp;nm.[11]</p><p>Very high electrical and thermal conductivity is common to the elements in group 11, because their single s electron is free and does not interact with the filled d subshell, as such interactions (which occur in the preceding transition metals) lower electron mobility.[12] The electrical conductivity of silver is the greatest of all metals, greater even than copper, but it is not widely used for this property because of the higher cost. An exception is in radio-frequency engineering, particularly at VHF and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those currents tend to flow on the surface of conductors rather than through the interior. During World War II in the US, 13540 tons of silver were used in electromagnets for enriching uranium, mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper.[13][14][15] Pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal, although the conductivity of carbon (in the diamond allotrope) and superfluid helium-4 are even higher.[5] Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal.[5]</p><p>Silver readily forms alloys with copper and gold, as well as zinc. Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as the structure of the silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to body-centred cubic (electron concentration 1.5), complex cubic (1.615), and hexagonal close-packed phases (1.75).[7]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Isotopes</h3><p> Main article: Isotopes of silver</p><p>Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u;[16][17] this value is very important because of the importance of silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis.[16] Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).[18]</p><p>Twenty-eight radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 105Ag with a half-life of 41.29 days, 111Ag with a half-life of 7.45 days, and 112Ag with a half-life of 3.13 hours. Silver has numerous nuclear isomers, the most stable being 108mAg (t1/2 = 418 years), 110mAg (t1/2 = 249.79 days) and 106mAg (t1/2 = 8.28 days). All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives of less than three minutes.[19]</p><p>Isotopes of silver range in relative atomic mass from 92.950&nbsp;u (93Ag) to 129.950&nbsp;u (130Ag);[20] the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 107Ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before 107Ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes, and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes.[19]</p><p>The palladium isotope 107Pd decays by beta emission to 107Ag with a half-life of 6.5 million years. Iron meteorites are the only objects with a high-enough palladium-to-silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107Ag abundance. Radiogenic 107Ag was first discovered in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978.[21] The discoverers suggest the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event. 107Pd–107Ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early solar system.[22]</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Silver is a rather unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is near the bottom of the electrochemical series (E0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799&nbsp;V).[6] In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize.[24] Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.[24]</p><p>Despite the above formulations, most silver compounds have significant covalent character due to the small size and high first ionization energy (730.8&nbsp;kJ/mol) of silver.[6] Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is higher than that of lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6&nbsp;kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8&nbsp;kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0&nbsp;kJ/mol).[25] Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide[26] as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals.[27] Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of p-acceptor ligands.[24]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Silver does not react with air, even at red heat, and thus was considered by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, with the exception of the notoriously reactive fluorine gas, with which it forms the difluoride. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.[23]</p><p>The three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, as well as reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly from the surface of the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.[28]</p><p>Silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as potassium permanganate (KMnO
		4) and potassium dichromate (K
		2Cr
		2O
		7), and in the presence of potassium bromide (KBr). These compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images, converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify the original image. Silver forms cyanide complexes (silver cyanide) that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions. Silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver.[29]</p><p>The common oxidation states of silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (for example, silver nitrate, AgNO3); +2 (for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); +3 (for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4); and even occasionally +4 (for example, potassium hexafluoroargentate(IV), K2AgF6).[30] The +1 state is by far the most common, followed by the reducing +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass.[31] Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidizing agent, krypton difluoride.[32]</p><h2>Compounds</h2><h3>Oxides and chalcogenides</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Sulfid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG/220px-Sulfid_st%C5%99%C3%ADbrn%C3%BD.PNG" width="220" height="82"><p>


		Silver(I) sulfide


		</p><p>
			Silver and gold have rather low chemical affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160&nbsp;°C.[33] This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidized by the strong oxidizing agent peroxodisulfate to black AgO, a mixed silver(I,III) oxide of formula AgIAgIIIO2. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag2O3 and Ag3O4, are also known, as is Ag3O which behaves as a metallic conductor.[33]</p><p>Silver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is the cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.[33]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Halides</h3><p> Main article: Silver halide</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/Common_Silver_Halide_Precipitates.jpg/220px-Common_Silver_Halide_Precipitates.jpg" width="220" height="164"><p>


		The three common silver halide precipitates: from left to right, silver iodide, silver bromide, and silver chloride.


		</p><p>
			The only known dihalide of silver is the difluoride, AgF2, which can be obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride is often used to synthesize hydrofluorocarbons.[34]</p><p>In stark contrast to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements.[34] As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X-Ag+ ? XAg) decreases.[34] The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates.[34] The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods.[16] All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography.[34] The reaction involved is:[35]</p><p>The process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a crystal defect or an impurity site, so that the electron's energy is lowered enough that it is trapped.[35]</p><h3>Other inorganic compounds</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Silver_nitrate_crystals.jpg/100px-Silver_nitrate_crystals.jpg" width="100" height="147"><p>


		Crystals of silver nitrate


		</p><p>
			White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the moon.[36] It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to.[16] Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.[37]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Yellow silver carbonate, Ag2CO3 can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate with a deficiency of silver nitrate.[38] Its principal use is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics. It is reduced with formaldehyde, producing silver free of alkali metals:[39]</p><p>Silver carbonate is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis such as the Koenigs-Knorr reaction. In the Fétizon oxidation, silver carbonate on celite acts as an oxidising agent to form lactones from diols. It is also employed to convert alkyl bromides into alcohols.[38]</p><p>Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive explosive used in percussion caps, is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide,[40] and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution.[24] In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.[24]</p><h3>Coordination compounds</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Diamminesilver%28I%29-3D-balls.png/220px-Diamminesilver%28I%29-3D-balls.png" width="220" height="120"><p>


		Structure of the diamminesilver(I) complex, [Ag(NH3)2]+

			Silver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate [Ag(IO5OH)2]5- and tellurate [Ag{TeO4(OH)2}2]5- complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic [AgF4]- is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.[31]</p><p>Silver(II) complexes are more common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, they are usually square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag2+, produced by oxidation of Ag+ by ozone, is a very strong oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in phosphoric acid due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as [Ag(py)4]2+ and [Ag(bipy)2]2+: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. [AgF4]2- is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with N- or O-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.[41]</p><p>However, the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I-. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion [Ag(H2O)4]+ is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form [Ag(NH3)2]+; silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex [Ag(S2O3)2]3-; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex [Ag(CN)2]-. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C=N?Ag–C=N?}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes [Ag(L–L)2]+.[42]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Organometallic</h3><p> Main article: Organosilver chemistry</p><p>Under standard conditions, silver does not form simple carbonyls, due to the weakness of the Ag–C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6–15&nbsp;K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)3, which dimerizes at 25–30&nbsp;K, probably by forming Ag–Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [Ag(CO)][B(OTeF5)4] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the platinum complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak p bonding in group 11. Ag–C s bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (-50&nbsp;°C) and CuMe (-15&nbsp;°C) as well as those of PhAg (74&nbsp;°C) and PhCu (100&nbsp;°C).[43]</p><p>The C–Ag bond is stabilized by perfluoroalkyl ligands, for example in AgCF(CF3)2.[44] Alkenylsilver compounds are also more stable than their alkylsilver counterparts.[45] Silver-NHC complexes are easily prepared, and are commonly used to prepare other NHC complexes by displacing labile ligands. For example, the reaction of the bis(NHC)silver(I) complex with bis(acetonitrile)palladium dichloride or chlorido(dimethyl sulfide)gold(I):[46]</p><br><img alt="Silver-NHC as carbene transmetallation agent.png" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Silver-NHC_as_carbene_transmetallation_agent.png/600px-Silver-NHC_as_carbene_transmetallation_agent.png" width="600" height="175"><h3>Intermetallic</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Ag-Au-Cu-colours-english.svg/250px-Ag-Au-Cu-colours-english.svg.png" width="250" height="218"><p>

			Silver also forms alloys with most other elements on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with silver in the condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry comes from the fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).[47]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Most other binary alloys are of little use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental amalgams are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys are very important in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.[47]</p><h2>Etymology</h2><p>The word silver appears in Anglo-Saxon in various spellings, such as seolfor and siolfor. A similar form is seen throughout the Germanic languages (compare Old High German silabar and silbir). The chemical symbol Ag is from the Latin word for silver, argentum (compare Ancient Greek ???????, árgyros), from the Proto-Indo-European root *h2er?- (formerly reconstructed as *ar?-), meaning white or shining: this was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and Balto-Slavic. The Balto-Slavic words for silver are quite similar to the Germanic ones (e.g. Russian ??????? [serebro], Polish srebro, Lithuanian sidabras) and they may have a common origin, although this is uncertain: some scholars have suggested the Akkadian sarpu refined silver as this origin, related to the word sarapu to refine or smelt.[48][49]</p><h2>History</h2><p>Silver was one of the seven metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history.[50] In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering.[51] However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money.[52] Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold.[51] For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC:[53] the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal.[54]</p><p>The situation changed with the discovery of cupellation, a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores. While slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC,[5] and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in Europe was Sardinia in early the Chalcolithic period,[55] these techniques did not spread widely until later, when it spread throughout the region and beyond.[53] The origins of silver production in India, China, and Japan were almost certainly equally ancient, but are not well-documented due to their great age.[54]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Silver_mining_in_Kutn%C3%A1_Hora_1490s.jpg/220px-Silver_mining_in_Kutn%C3%A1_Hora_1490s.jpg" width="220" height="320"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Silver mining and processing in Kutná Hora, Central Europe, 1490s

			When the Phoenicians first came to what is now Spain, they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead.[53] By the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations, silver coins were a staple of the economy:[51] the Greeks were already extracting silver from galena by the 7th century BC,[53] and the rise of Athens was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at Laurium, from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 BC.[56] The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World. Reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year, an estimated silver stock of 10000 tonnes circulated in the Roman economy in the middle of the second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate around AD 800.[57][58] The Romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern Europe in the same time period. This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of Charlemagne: by then, tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted.[54]</p><p>Central Europe became the centre of silver production during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Erzgebirge, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Salzburg, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, but a few of them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50&nbsp;tonnes per year.[54] In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.[54][59]</p><p>With the discovery of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around the beginning of the 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina:[54] the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth.[56] In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined.[54] Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after the discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.[54]</p><h2>Symbolic role</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/6852_les_deniers_de_judas.JPG/220px-6852_les_deniers_de_judas.JPG" width="220" height="330"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			Silver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore. The Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days (lines 109–201) lists different ages of man named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity.[60] Ovid's Metamorphoses contains another retelling of the story, containing an illustration of silver's metaphorical use of signifying the second-best in a series, better than bronze but worse than gold:</p><p>But when good Saturn, banish'd from above,
		Was driv'n to Hell, the world was under Jove.
		Succeeding times a silver age behold,
		Excelling brass, but more excell'd by gold.</p><p>In folklore, silver was commonly thought to have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters.[61][62] From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet.[63] Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom thirty pieces of silver, referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.[64]</p><p>Not only silver but also its means of production have inspired figurative language. Clear references to cupellation occur throughout the Old Testament of the Bible, such as in Jeremiah's rebuke to Judah: The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them. (Jeremiah 6:19–20) Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal: Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men. (Jeremiah 10:9)[53]</p><p>Ethically, silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness; this is the negative aspect, the perverting of its value.[65]</p><h2>Occurrence and production</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Acanthite_-_Chispas_Mine%2C_Arizpe%2C_Sonora%2C_Mexico.jpg/220px-Acanthite_-_Chispas_Mine%2C_Arizpe%2C_Sonora%2C_Mexico.jpg" width="220" height="304"><p>

			The abundance of silver in the Earth's crust is 0.08&nbsp;parts per million, almost exactly the same as that of mercury. It mostly occurs in sulfide ores, especially acanthite and argentite, Ag2S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite (including horn silver), AgCl, which is prevalent in Chile and New South Wales.[66] Most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from Tertiary period vulcanism.[67]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The principal sources of silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia.[5] Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, and are still major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico).[68] Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia),[69] and Hackett River (Canada).[68] In Central Asia, Tajikistan is known to have some of the largest silver deposits in the world.[70]</p><p>Silver is usually found in nature combined with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally in the form of sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process.[71] Lead melts at 327&nbsp;°C, lead oxide at 888&nbsp;°C and silver melts at 960&nbsp;°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960&nbsp;°C to 1000&nbsp;°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.[72][73][74]</p><p>Today, silver metal is primarily produced instead as a secondary byproduct of electrolytic refining of copper, lead, and zinc, and by application of the Parkes process on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver.[75] In such processes, silver follows the non-ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting, and is later purified out. For eample, in copper production, purified copper is electrolytically deposited on the cathode, while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so-called anode slime. This is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute sulfuric acid and heating with lime or silica flux, before the silver is purified to over 99.9% purity via electrolysis in nitrate solution.[66]</p><p>Commercial-grade fine silver is at least 99.9% pure, and purities greater than 99.999% are available. In 2014, Mexico was the top producer of silver (5,000 tonnes or 18.7% of the world's total of 26,800 t), followed by China (4,060 t) and Peru (3,780 t).[75]</p><h2>Applications</h2><h3>Currency</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/1000oz.silver.bullion.bar.top.jpg/220px-1000oz.silver.bullion.bar.top.jpg" width="220" height="153"><p>

			The earliest known coins of the Western world were minted in the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC.[76] The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia.[76] Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma,[77] the Roman denarius,[78] the Islamic dirham,[79] the Indian rupee from the time of the Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard),[80] and the Spanish dollar.[81][82]</p><p>The ratio between the amount of silver used for coinage and that used for other purposes has fluctuated greatly over time; for example, in wartime, more silver tends to have been used for coinage to finance the war.[83]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 currency code XAG, one of only four precious metals to have one (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold).[84] Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.[83]</p><h3>Jewellery and silverware</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Alexandra_Nikolaevna%27s_toilet_set_%28Fasanierie_castle%29_02_by_shako.JPG/220px-Alexandra_Nikolaevna%27s_toilet_set_%28Fasanierie_castle%29_02_by_shako.JPG" width="220" height="258"><p>

			The major use of silver besides coinage throughout most of history was in the manufacture of jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver;[85] in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.[86]</p><p>Because pure silver is very soft, most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of silver in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.[85]</p><h3>Medicine</h3><p> Main article: Medical uses of silver</p><p>In medicine, silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia).[87][88] The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. They interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, synthesise cell walls, and bond with the bacteria's genetic material. Microbes cannot develop resistance to silver as they can to antibiotics, and hence silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer.[89][90] Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry.[86]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Electronics</h3><p>Silver is very important in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints,[5][91] Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.[92]</p><h3>Brazing alloys</h3><p>Silver-containing brazing alloys are used for brazing metallic materials, mostly cobalt, nickel, and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and phosphorus. Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.[93]</p><h3>Chemical equipment</h3><p>Silver is useful in the manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.[94]</p><h3>Catalysis</h3><p>Silver metal is a good catalyst for oxidation reactions; in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on a-Al2O3 or silicates is a catalyst for the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270&nbsp;°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720&nbsp;°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.[94]</p><h3>Photography</h3><p>The photosensitivity of the silver halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.[95]</p><p>The use of silver nitrate and silver halides in photography has rapidly declined with the advent of digital technology. From the peak global demand for photographic silver in 1999 (267,000,000 troy ounces or 8304.6 metric tonnes) the market contracted almost 70% by 2013.[96]</p><h3>Nanoparticles</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100&nbsp;nanometres in size, are used in many applications. They are used in conductive inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals in much the same way as larger silver particles.[90]</p><h3>Others</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Diwali_sweets_India_2009.jpg/220px-Diwali_sweets_India_2009.jpg" width="220" height="147"><p>

			Pure silver metal is used as a food colouring. It has the E174 designation and is approved in the European Union.[97] Traditional Indian dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as vark,[98] and in various other cultures, silver dragée are used to decorate cakes, cookies, and other dessert items.[99]</p><p>Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light insensities. Colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it has the advantage of not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.[90]</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p>Silver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning.[100] Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of the other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.[100]</p><p>In large doses, silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis.[100][5]</p><p>Metallic silver, like copper, is an antibacterial agent, which was known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli.

Pure sodium carbonate is a white, odorless powder that is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air). It has a strongly alkaline taste, and forms a moderately basic solution in water. Sodium carbonate is well known domestically for its everyday use as a water softener. Historically it was extracted from the ashes of plants growing in sodium-rich soils, such as vegetation from the Middle East, kelp from Scotland and seaweed from Spain. Because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were noticeably different from ashes of timber (used to create potash), they became known as soda ash.[12] It is synthetically produced in large quantities from salt (sodium chloride) and limestone by a method known as the Solvay process.</p><p>The manufacture of glass is one of the most important uses of sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate acts as a flux for silica, lowering the melting point of the mixture to something achievable without special materials. This soda glass is mildly water-soluble, so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass produced insoluble. This type of glass is known as soda lime glass: soda for the sodium carbonate and lime for the calcium carbonate. Soda lime glass has been the most common form of glass for centuries.</p><p>Sodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various settings. For example, it is used as a pH regulator to maintain stable alkaline conditions necessary for the action of the majority of photographic film developing agents. It acts as an alkali because when dissolved in water, it dissociates into the weak acid: carbonic acid and the strong alkali: sodium hydroxide. This gives sodium carbonate in solution the ability to attack metals such as aluminium with the release of hydrogen gas.[13]</p><p>It is a common additive in swimming pools used to raise the ph which can be lowered by chlorine tablets and other additives which contains acids.</p><p>In cooking, it is sometimes used in place of sodium hydroxide for lyeing, especially with German pretzels and lye rolls. These dishes are treated with a solution of an alkaline substance to change the pH of the surface of the food and improve browning.</p><p>In taxidermy, sodium carbonate added to boiling water will remove flesh from the skull or bones of trophies to create the European skull mount or for educational display in biological and historical studies.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In chemistry, it is often used as an electrolyte. Electrolytes are usually salt-based, and sodium carbonate acts as a very good conductor in the process of electrolysis. In addition, unlike chloride ions, which form chlorine gas, carbonate ions are not corrosive to the anodes. It is also used as a primary standard for acid-base titrations because it is solid and air-stable, making it easy to weigh accurately.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Domestic use</h2><p>Soda ash is used as a water softener in laundering: it competes with the magnesium and calcium ions in hard water and prevents them from bonding with the detergent being used, but doesn't prevent scaling.[14] Sodium carbonate can be used to remove grease, oil, and wine stains.</p><p>In dyeing with fiber-reactive dyes, sodium carbonate (often under a name such as soda ash fixative or soda ash activator) is used to ensure proper chemical bonding of the dye with cellulose (plant) fibers, typically before dyeing (for tie dyes), mixed with the dye (for dye painting), or after dyeing (for immersion dyeing).</p><h2>Sodium carbonate test</h2><p>The sodium carbonate test (not to be confused with sodium carbonate extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium. For the complete sequence of tests used for qualitative cation analysis, see qualitative inorganic analysis.</p><h2>Main applications</h2><p>By far the largest consumption of sodium carbonate is in the manufacture of glass, paper, rayon, soaps, and detergents. It is also used as a water softener, since carbonate can precipitate the calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water.</p><p>Sodium carbonate is a food additive (E500) used as an acidity regulator, anticaking agent, raising agent, and stabilizer. It is one of the components of kansui (????), a solution of alkaline salts used to give ramen noodles their characteristic flavor and texture. It is also used in the production of snus (Swedish-style snuff) to stabilize the pH of the final product.</p><p>Sodium carbonate is also used in the production of sherbet powder. The cooling and fizzing sensation results from the endothermic reaction between sodium carbonate and a weak acid, commonly citric acid, releasing carbon dioxide gas, which occurs when the sherbet is moistened by saliva.</p><p>In China, it is used to replace lye-water in the crust of traditional Cantonese moon cakes, and in many other Chinese steamed buns and noodles.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Sodium carbonate is used by the brick industry as a wetting agent to reduce the amount of water needed to extrude the clay.</p><p>In casting, it is referred to as bonding agent and is used to allow wet alginate to adhere to gelled alginate.</p><p>Sodium carbonate is used in toothpastes, where it acts as a foaming agent and an abrasive, and to temporarily increase mouth pH.</p><p>Sodium carbonate is used by the cotton industry to neutralize the sulfuric acid needed for acid delinting of fuzzy cottonseed.</p><p>Sodium carbonate, in a solution with common salt, may be used for cleaning silver. In a nonreactive container (glass, plastic, or ceramic), aluminium foil and the silver object are immersed in the hot salt solution. The elevated pH dissolves the aluminium oxide layer on the foil and enables an electrolytic cell to be established. Hydrogen ions produced by this reaction reduce the sulfide ions on the silver restoring silver metal. The sulfide can be released as small amounts of hydrogen sulfide. Rinsing and gently polishing the silver restores a highly polished condition.[15]</p><p>Sodium carbonate is used in some aquarium water pH buffers to maintain a desired pH and carbonate hardness (KH).</p><h2>Physical properties</h2><p>The integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is -28.1&nbsp;kJ/mol for a 10% w/w aqueous solution.[16] The Mohs hardness of sodium carbonate monohydrate is 1.3.[6]</p><h2>Hydrates</h2><p>Sodium carbonate crystallizes from water to form three different hydrates:</p><h2>Occurrence as natural mineral</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Na2CO3.H2O-bas.png/160px-Na2CO3.H2O-bas.png" width="160" height="128"><p>

			Sodium carbonate is soluble in water, and can occur naturally in arid regions, especially in mineral deposits (evaporites) formed when seasonal lakes evaporate. Deposits of the mineral natron have been mined from dry lake bottoms in Egypt since ancient times, when natron was used in the preparation of mummies and in the early manufacture of glass.</p><p>The anhydrous mineral form of sodium carbonate is quite rare and called natrite. Sodium carbonate also erupts from Ol Doinyo Lengai, Tanzania's unique volcano, and it is presumed to have erupted from other volcanoes in the past, but due to these minerals' instability at the earth's surface, are likely to be eroded. All three mineralogical forms of sodium carbonate, as well as trona, trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate, are also known from ultra-alkaline pegmatitic rocks, that occur for example in the Kola Peninsula in Russia.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Extraterrestrially, known sodium carbonate is rare. Deposits have been identified as the source of bright spots on Ceres, interior material that has been brought to the surface.[19] While there are carbonates on Mars, and these are expected to include sodium carbonate,[20] deposits have yet to be confirmed, this absence is explained by some as being due to a global dominance of low pH in previously aqueous Martian soil.[21]</p><h2>Production</h2><h3>Mining</h3><p>Trona, trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate (Na3HCO3CO3·2H2O), is mined in several areas of the US and provides nearly all the domestic consumption of sodium carbonate. Large natural deposits found in 1938, such as the one near Green River, Wyoming, have made mining more economical than industrial production in North America. There are important reserves of trona in Turkey; two million tons of soda ash have been extracted from the reserves near Ankara. It is also mined from some alkaline lakes such as Lake Magadi in Kenya by dredging. Hot saline springs continuously replenish salt in the lake so that, provided the rate of dredging is no greater than the replenishment rate, the source is fully sustainable.[citation needed]</p><h3>Barilla and kelp</h3><p>Several halophyte (salt-tolerant) plant species and seaweed species can be processed to yield an impure form of sodium carbonate, and these sources predominated in Europe and elsewhere until the early 19th century. The land plants (typically glassworts or saltworts) or the seaweed (typically Fucus species) were harvested, dried, and burned. The ashes were then lixiviated (washed with water) to form an alkali solution. This solution was boiled dry to create the final product, which was termed soda ash; this very old name refers to the archetypal plant source for soda ash, which was the small annual shrub Salsola soda (barilla plant).</p><p>The sodium carbonate concentration in soda ash varied very widely, from 2–3 percent for the seaweed-derived form (kelp), to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from saltwort plants in Spain. Plant and seaweed sources for soda ash, and also for the related alkali potash, became increasingly inadequate by the end of the 18th century, and the search for commercially viable routes to synthesizing soda ash from salt and other chemicals intensified.[22]</p><h3>Leblanc process</h3><p> Main article: Leblanc process</p><p>In 1791, the French chemist Nicolas Leblanc patented a process for producing sodium carbonate from salt, sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal. First, sea salt (sodium chloride) was boiled in sulfuric acid to yield sodium sulfate and hydrogen chloride gas, according to the chemical equation</p><p>Next, the sodium sulfate was blended with crushed limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal, and the mixture was burnt, producing calcium sulfide.</p><p>The sodium carbonate was extracted from the ashes with water, and then collected by allowing the water to evaporate.</p><p>The hydrochloric acid produced by the Leblanc process was a major source of air pollution, and the calcium sulfide byproduct also presented waste disposal issues. However, it remained the major production method for sodium carbonate until the late 1880s.[22][23]</p><h3>Solvay process</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Main article: Solvay process</p><p>In 1861, the Belgian industrial chemist Ernest Solvay developed a method to convert sodium chloride to sodium carbonate using ammonia. The Solvay process centered around a large hollow tower. At the bottom, calcium carbonate (limestone) was heated to release carbon dioxide:</p><p>At the top, a concentrated solution of sodium chloride and ammonia entered the tower. As the carbon dioxide bubbled up through it, sodium bicarbonate precipitated:</p><p>The sodium bicarbonate was then converted to sodium carbonate by heating it, releasing water and carbon dioxide:</p><p>Meanwhile, the ammonia was regenerated from the ammonium chloride byproduct by treating it with the lime (calcium hydroxide) left over from carbon dioxide generation:</p><p>Because the Solvay process recycles its ammonia, it consumes only brine and limestone, and has calcium chloride as its only waste product. This made it substantially more economical than the Leblanc process, and it soon came to dominate world sodium carbonate production. By 1900, 90% of sodium carbonate was produced by the Solvay process, and the last Leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s.The Solvay process results in soda ash (predominantly sodium carbonate (Na2CO3)) from brine (as a source of sodium chloride (NaCl)) and from limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)).[6] The overall process is:</p><p>2 NaCl + CaCO3 ? Na2CO3 + CaCl2</p><p>The actual implementation of this global, overall reaction is intricate.[8][9][10] A simplified description can be given using the four different, interacting chemical reactions illustrated in the figure. In the first step in the process, carbon dioxide (CO2) passes through a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (table salt, NaCl) and ammonia (NH3).</p><p>NaCl + CO2 + NH3 + H2O ? NaHCO3 + NH4Cl (I)</p><p>In industrial practice, the reaction is carried out by passing concentrated brine through two towers. In the first, ammonia bubbles up through the brine (salt water) and is absorbed by it. In the second, carbon dioxide bubbles up through the ammoniated brine, and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) precipitates out of the solution. Note that, in a basic solution, NaHCO3 is less water-soluble than sodium chloride. The ammonia (NH3) buffers the solution at a basic pH; without the ammonia, a hydrochloric acid byproduct would render the solution acidic, and arrest the precipitation.</p><p>The necessary ammonia catalyst for reaction (I) is reclaimed in a later step, and relatively little ammonia is consumed. The carbon dioxide required for reaction (I) is produced by heating (calcination) of the limestone at 950 - 1100&nbsp;°C. The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the limestone is partially converted to quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)) and carbon dioxide:</p><p>CaCO3 ? CO2 + CaO (II)</p><p>The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) that precipitates out in reaction (I) is filtered out from the hot ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solution, and the solution is then reacted with the quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)) left over from heating the limestone in step (II).</p><p>2 NH4Cl + CaO ? 2 NH3 + CaCl2 + H2O (III)</p><p>CaO makes a strong basic solution. The ammonia from reaction (III) is recycled back to the initial brine solution of reaction (I).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) precipitate from reaction (I) is then converted to the final product, sodium carbonate (washing soda: Na2CO3), by calcination (160 - 230 C), producing water and carbon dioxide as byproducts:</p><p>2 NaHCO3 ? Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2 (IV)</p><p>The carbon dioxide from step (IV) is recovered for re-use in step (I). When properly designed and operated, a Solvay plant can reclaim almost all its ammonia, and consumes only small amounts of additional ammonia to make up for losses. The only major inputs to the Solvay process are salt, limestone and thermal energy, and its only major byproduct is calcium chloride, which is sold as road salt.</p><h3>Hou's process</h3><p>This process was developed by Chinese chemist Hou Debang in the 1930s. The earlier steam reforming byproduct carbon dioxide was pumped through a saturated solution of sodium chloride and ammonia to produce sodium bicarbonate by these reactions:</p><p>The sodium bicarbonate was collected as a precipitate due to its low solubility and then heated to yield pure sodium carbonate similar to last step of the Solvay process. More sodium chloride is added to the remaining solution of ammonium and sodium chlorides; also, more ammonia is pumped at 30-40&nbsp;°C to this solution. The solution temperature is then lowered to below 10&nbsp;°C. Solubility of ammonium chloride is higher than that of sodium chloride at 30&nbsp;°C and lower at 10&nbsp;°C. Due to this temperature-dependent solubility difference and the common-ion effect, ammonium chloride is precipitated in a sodium chloride solution.</p><p>The Chinese name of Hou's process, lianhe zhijian fa (?????), means coupled manufacturing alkali method: Hou's process is coupled to the Haber process and offers better atom economy by eliminating the production of calcium chloride, since ammonia no longer needs to be regenerated. The byproduct ammonium chloride can be sold as a fertilizer.</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sodium_carbonate&amp;oldid=778524526"

It experienced a revival starting in the 1980s due largely to the efforts of experimenters Gordon Hutchings and John Wimberley. Hutchings spent over a decade working on pyrogallol formulas, eventually producing one he named PMK (for its main ingredients, pyrogallol, Metol, and Kodalk [trade name of Kodak for sodium metaborate]). This formulation resolved the consistency issues, and Hutchings found that an interaction between the greenish stain given to film by pyro developers and the color sensitivity of modern variable-contrast photographic papers gave the effect of an extreme compensating developer.

			Acetanilide[6] is an odourless solid chemical of leaf or flake-like appearance. It is also known as N-phenylacetamide, acetanil, or acetanilid, and was formerly known by the trade name Antifebrin.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Preparation and properties</h2><p>Acetanilide can be produced by reacting acetic anhydride with aniline:</p><p>The preparation used to be a traditional experiment in introductory organic chemistry lab classes,[7] but it has now been widely replaced by the preparation of either paracetamol or aspirin, both of which teach the same practical techniques (especially recrystallization of the product) but which avoid the use of aniline, a suspected carcinogen.</p><p>Acetanilide is slightly soluble in water, and stable under most conditions.[5] Pure crystals are plate shaped and colorless to white.</p><h2>Applications</h2><p>Acetanilide is used as an inhibitor of hydrogen peroxide decomposition and is used to stabilize cellulose ester varnishes. It has also found uses in the intermediation in rubber accelerator synthesis, dyes and dye intermediate synthesis, and camphor synthesis. Acetanilide is used for the production of 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride, a key intermediate for the manufacture of the sulfa drugs.[8] It is also a precursor in the synthesis of penicillin[citation needed] and other pharmaceuticals.[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 19th century acetanilide was one of a large number of compounds used as experimental photographic developers.</p><h3>Pharmaceutical use</h3><p>Acetanilide was the first aniline derivative found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice under the names of Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886.[9] But its (apparent) unacceptable toxic effects, the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia and ultimately liver and kidney damage,[10] prompted the search for supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives such as phenacetin.[11] After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the human body, and that it was this metabolite that was responsible for the analgesic and antipyretic properties.[12][10][13][14] The observed methemoglobinemia after acetanilide administration was ascribed to the small proportion of acetanilide that is hydrolyzed to aniline in the body.[note 1] Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (acetaminophen) – is well known (although it is itself toxic in excessive amounts).</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acetanilide&amp;oldid=782039378"

					</p><br><h1 lang="en">Potassium bromide</h1><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p>Potassium bromide (KBr) is a salt, widely used as an anticonvulsant and a sedative in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with over-the-counter use extending to 1975 in the US. Its action is due to the bromide ion (sodium bromide is equally effective). Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, as an antiepileptic medication for dogs.</p><p>Under standard conditions, potassium bromide is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher.[by how much?] These effects are mainly due to the properties of the potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts).</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Chemical properties</h2><p>Potassium bromide, a typical ionic salt, is fully dissociated and near pH 7 in aqueous solution. It serves as a source of bromide ions. This reaction is important for the manufacture of silver bromide for photographic film:</p><p>Aqueous bromide Br- also forms complexes when reacted with some metal halides such as copper(II) bromide:</p><h2>Preparation</h2><p>A traditional method for the manufacture of KBr is the reaction of potassium carbonate with an iron(III,III, II) bromide, Fe3Br8, made by treating scrap iron under water with excess bromine:[2]</p><h2>Applications</h2><h3>Medical and veterinary</h3><p>The anticonvulsant properties of potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock at a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation.[3] Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day).[3]</p><p>There was not a better epilepsy drug until phenobarbital in 1912. It was often said the British Army laced soldiers' tea with bromide to quell sexual arousal—but that is likely untrue as doing so would also diminish alertness in battle and similar stories exist about a number of substances.[4][citation needed]</p><p>Bromide compounds, especially sodium bromide, remained in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as the original formulation of Bromo-Seltzer) in the US until 1975, when bromides were outlawed in all over-the-counter medicines, due to chronic toxicity.[5] Bromide's exceedingly long half life in the body made it difficult to dose without side effects (see below). Medical use of bromides in the US was discontinued at this time, as many better and shorter-acting sedatives were known by then.</p><p>Potassium bromide is used in veterinary medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able as a matter of routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
