Landsat 5 satellite photo.</p><p>The lake may be infilled with deposited sediment and gradually become a wetland such as a swamp or marsh. Large water plants, typically reeds, accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows. Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake.[48] This is significant since wildfire has been largely suppressed in the developed world over the past century. This has artificially converted many shallow lakes into emergent marshes. Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant-eating fish tend to disappear more slowly. A disappearing lake (barely noticeable on a human timescale) typically has extensive plant mats at the water's edge. These become a new habitat for other plants, like peat moss when conditions are right, and animals, many of which are very rare. Gradually the lake closes and young peat may form, forming a fen. In lowland river valleys where a river can meander, the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical oxbow lakes. In the very last stages of succession, trees can grow in, eventually turning the wetland into a forest.</p><p>Some lakes can disappear seasonally. These are called intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes and can be found in karstic terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graubünden. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains.[49] The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah.</p><p>Sometimes a lake will disappear quickly. On 3 June 2005, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, a lake called Lake Beloye vanished in a matter of minutes. News sources reported that government officials theorized that this strange phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the Oka River.[50]</p><p>The presence of ground permafrost is important to the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science (Disappearing Arctic Lakes, June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Some lakes disappear because of human development factors.

The largest Titanean lake, Kraken Mare at 400,000&nbsp;km2, is three-times the size of any lake on Earth, and even the second, Ligeia Mare, is estimated to be slightly larger than Earth's Lake Michigan–Huron.</p><p>Jupiter's large moon Io is volcanically active, and as a result sulfur deposits have accumulated on the surface. Some photographs taken during the Galileo mission appear to show lakes of liquid sulfur in volcanic caldera, though these are more analogous to lake of lava than of water on Earth.[51]</p><p>The planet Mars is too cold and has too little atmospheric pressure to permit the pooling of liquid water. Geologic evidence appears to confirm, however, that ancient lakes once formed on the surface.

See left for a close-up view of a single rill</p><p>Rills are narrow and shallow channels which are eroded into unprotected soil by hillslope runoff. Since soil is regularly left bare during agricultural operations, rills may form on farmland during these vulnerable periods. Rills may also form when bare soil is left exposed following deforestation, or during construction activities.</p><p>Rills are fairly easily visible when first incised, so they are often the first indication of an ongoing erosion problem. Unless soil conservation measures are put into place, rills on regularly eroding areas may eventually develop into larger erosional features such as gullies or even (in semi-arid regions) into badlands.</p><h3>Rill initiation[edit]</h3><p>Rills are created when water erodes the topsoil on hillsides, and so are significantly affected by seasonal weather patterns. They tend to appear more often in rainier months.[1] Rills begin to form when the runoff shear stress, the ability of surface runoff to detach soil particles, overcomes the soil’s shear strength, the ability of soil to resist force working parallel to the soil’s surface. This begins the erosion process as water breaks soil particles free and carries them down the slope.[2] These forces explain why sandy, loamy soils are especially susceptible to the formation of rills, whereas dense clays tend to resist rill formation.[3]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Rill_initiation%2C_finger_pointing_at_a_newly-developed_headcut.jpeg/220px-Rill_initiation%2C_finger_pointing_at_a_newly-developed_headcut.jpeg" width="220" height="139"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Rill initiation: the finger is pointing at a headcut which has just been incised by runoff which is flowing from right to left</p><p>Rills cannot form on every surface, and their formation is intrinsically connected to the steepness of the hillside slope. Gravity determines the force of the water, which provides the power required to start the erosional environment necessary to create rills. Therefore, the formation of rills is primarily controlled by the slope of the hillside. Slope controls the depth of the rills, while the length of the slope and the soil’s permeability control the number of incisions in an area. Each type of soil has a threshold value, a slope angle below which water velocity cannot produce sufficient force to dislodge enough soil particles for rills to form.[4] For instance, on many non-cohesive slopes, this threshold value hovers around an angle of 2 degrees with a shear velocity between 3 and 3.5&nbsp;cm/s.[5]</p><p>After rills begin forming, they are subjected to variety of other erosional forces which may increase their size and output volume. Up to 37% of erosion in a rill-ridden area may derive from mass movement, or collapse, of rill sidewalls. As water flows through a rill, it will undercut into the walls, triggering collapse. Also, as water seeps into the soil of the walls, they weaken, amplifying the chance of wall collapse. The erosion created by these forces increases the size of the rill while also swelling its output volume.[6]</p><p>Less commonly, dissolution of limestone and other soluble rocks by slightly acidic rainfall and runoff also results in the formation of rill-like features on the surface of the rock.[7]</p><h3>Significance of rill erosion[edit]</h3><p>Although rills are small, they transport significant amounts of soil each year. Some estimates claim rill flow has a carrying capacity of nearly ten times that of non-rill, or interrill, areas. In a moderate rainfall, rill flow can carry rock fragments up to 9&nbsp;cm in diameter downslope. In 1987, scientist J. Poesen conducted an experiment on the Huldenberg field in Belgium which revealed that during a moderate rainfall, rill erosion removed as much as 200&nbsp;kg (in submerged weight) of rock.[8]</p><p>Unfortunately, the considerable effect rills have on landscapes often negatively impact human activity. Rills have been observed washing away archaeological sites.[8] They are also very common in agricultural areas because sustained agriculture depletes the soil of much of its organic content, increasing the erodibility of the soil. Agricultural machines, such as tractors, compact the soil to the point where water flows over the surface rather than seeping into the soil. Tractor wheel impressions often channel water, providing a perfect environment for the generation of rills. If left alone, these rills may erode considerable amounts of arable soil.[9]</p><p>Under proper field management rills are small and are easily repaired by contour tilling the soil. This will prevent, for a time at least, the rills from growing and eroding the landscape more rapidly with time.[10]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

This might occur because soil is saturated to full capacity, because rain arrives more quickly than soil can absorb it, or because impervious areas (roofs and pavement) send their runoff to surrounding soil that cannot absorb all of it. Surface runoff is a major component of the water cycle. It is the primary agent in soil erosion by water.[1][2]</p><p>Runoff that occurs on the ground surface before reaching a channel is also called a nonpoint source. If a nonpoint source contains man-made contaminants, or natural forms of pollution (such as rotting leaves) the runoff is called nonpoint source pollution. A land area which produces runoff that drains to a common point is called a drainage basin. When runoff flows along the ground, it can pick up soil contaminants including petroleum, pesticides, or fertilizers that become discharge or nonpoint source pollution.[3]</p><p>In addition to causing water erosion and pollution, surface runoff in urban areas is a primary cause of urban flooding which can result in property damage, damp and mold in basements, and street flooding.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Generation[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Runoffrazorback.jpg/260px-Runoffrazorback.jpg" width="260" height="195"><br><p>Surface runoff from a hillside after soil is saturated</p><p>Surface runoff can be generated either by rainfall, snowfall or by the melting of snow, or glaciers.</p><p>Snow and glacier melt occur only in areas cold enough for these to form permanently. Typically snowmelt will peak in the spring and glacier melt in the summer, leading to pronounced flow maxima in rivers affected by them. The determining factor of the rate of melting of snow or glaciers is both air temperature and the duration of sunlight. In high mountain regions, streams frequently rise on sunny days and fall on cloudy ones for this reason.</p><p>In areas where there is no snow, runoff will come from rainfall. However, not all rainfall will produce runoff because storage from soils can absorb light showers. On the extremely ancient soils of Australia and Southern Africa,[4] proteoid roots with their extremely dense networks of root hairs can absorb so much rainwater as to prevent runoff even when substantial amounts of rain fall. In these regions, even on less infertile cracking clay soils, high amounts of rainfall and potential evaporation are needed to generate any surface runoff, leading to specialised adaptations to extremely variable (usually ephemeral) streams.</p><h3>Infiltration excess overland flow[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv" style="width:446px;height:251px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Runoff_and_filtersoxx.ogv/446px--Runoff_and_filtersoxx.ogv.jpg"><p>Play media


					runoff and filter soxx</p><p>This occurs when the rate of rainfall on a surface exceeds the rate at which water can infiltrate the ground, and any depression storage has already been filled. This is called flooding excess overland flow, Hortonian overland flow (after Robert E. Horton), or unsaturated overland flow. This more commonly occurs in arid and semi-arid regions, where rainfall intensities are high and the soil infiltration capacity is reduced because of surface sealing, or in paved areas. This occurs largely in city areas where pavements prevent water from flooding.</p><h3>Saturation excess overland flow[edit]</h3><p>When the soil is saturated and the depression storage filled, and rain continues to fall, the rainfall will immediately produce surface runoff. The level of antecedent soil moisture is one factor affecting the time until soil becomes saturated. This runoff is called saturation excess overland flow or saturated overland flow.</p><h3>Antecedent soil moisture[edit]</h3><p>Soil retains a degree of moisture after a rainfall. This residual water moisture affects the soil's infiltration capacity. During the next rainfall event, the infiltration capacity will cause the soil to be saturated at a different rate. The higher the level of antecedent soil moisture, the more quickly the soil becomes saturated. Once the soil is saturated, runoff occurs.</p><h3>Subsurface return flow[edit]</h3><p>After water infiltrates the soil on an up-slope portion of a hill, the water may flow laterally through the soil, and exfiltrate (flow out of the soil) closer to a channel. This is called subsurface return flow or throughflow.</p><p>As it flows, the amount of runoff may be reduced in a number of possible ways: a small portion of it may evapotranspire; water may become temporarily stored in microtopographic depressions; and a portion of it may infiltrate as it flows overland. Any remaining surface water eventually flows into a receiving water body such as a river, lake, estuary or ocean.[5]</p><h2>Human influence[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/View_of_urban_runoff_discharging_to_coastal_waters.jpg/200px-View_of_urban_runoff_discharging_to_coastal_waters.jpg" width="200" height="231"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Urban surface water runoff</p><p>Urbanization increases surface runoff by creating more impervious surfaces such as pavement and buildings that do not allow percolation of the water down through the soil to the aquifer. It is instead forced directly into streams or storm water runoff drains, where erosion and siltation can be major problems, even when flooding is not. Increased runoff reduces groundwater recharge, thus lowering the water table and making droughts worse, especially for farmers and others who depend on the water wells.</p><p>When anthropogenic contaminants are dissolved or suspended in runoff, the human impact is expanded to create water pollution. This pollutant load can reach various receiving waters such as streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries and oceans with resultant water chemistry changes to these water systems and their related ecosystems.</p><p>A 2008 report by the United States National Research Council identified urban stormwater as a leading source of water quality problems in the U.S.[6]</p><p>As humans continue to alter the climate through the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, precipitation patterns are expected to change as the atmospheric capacity for water vapor increases. This will have direct consequences on runoff amounts.[7]</p><p>See also: Urban runoff and Rainwater harvesting</p><h2>Effects of surface runoff[edit]</h2><h3>Erosion and deposition[edit]</h3><p>Surface runoff can cause erosion of the Earth's surface; eroded material may be deposited a considerable distance away. There are four main types of soil erosion by water: splash erosion, sheet erosion, rill erosion and gully erosion. Splash erosion is the result of mechanical collision of raindrops with the soil surface: soil particles which are dislodged by the impact then move with the surface runoff. Sheet erosion is the overland transport of sediment by runoff without a well defined channel. Soil surface roughness causes may cause runoff to become concentrated into narrower flow paths: as these incise, the small but well-defined channels which are formed are known as rills. These channels can be as small as one centimeter wide or as large as several meters. If runoff continue to incise and enlarge rills, they may eventually grow to become gullies. Gully erosion can transport large amounts of eroded material in a small time period.</p><p>Reduced crop productivity usually results from erosion, and these effects are studied in the field of soil conservation. The soil particles carried in runoff vary in size from about .001 millimeter to 1.0 millimeter in diameter. Larger particles settle over short transport distances, whereas small particles can be carried over long distances suspended in the water column. Erosion of silty soils that contain smaller particles generates turbidity and diminishes light transmission, which disrupts aquatic ecosystems.</p><p>Entire sections of countries have been rendered unproductive by erosion. On the high central plateau of Madagascar, approximately ten percent of that country's land area, virtually the entire landscape is devoid of vegetation, with erosive gully furrows typically in excess of 50 meters deep and one kilometer wide. Shifting cultivation is a farming system which sometimes incorporates the slash and burn method in some regions of the world. Erosion causes loss of the fertile top soil and reduces its fertility and quality of the agricultural produce.</p><p>Modern industrial farming is another major cause of erosion. In some areas in the American corn belt, more than 50 percent of the original topsoil has been carried away within the last 100 years.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Environmental effects[edit]</h3><p>The principal environmental issues associated with runoff are the impacts to surface water, groundwater and soil through transport of water pollutants to these systems. Ultimately these consequences translate into human health risk, ecosystem disturbance and aesthetic impact to water resources. Some of the contaminants that create the greatest impact to surface waters arising from runoff are petroleum substances, herbicides and fertilizers. Quantitative uptake by surface runoff of pesticides and other contaminants has been studied since the 1960s, and early on contact of pesticides with water was known to enhance phytotoxicity.[8] In the case of surface waters, the impacts translate to water pollution, since the streams and rivers have received runoff carrying various chemicals or sediments. When surface waters are used as potable water supplies, they can be compromised regarding health risks and drinking water aesthetics (that is, odor, color and turbidity effects). Contaminated surface waters risk altering the metabolic processes of the aquatic species that they host; these alterations can lead to death, such as fish kills, or alter the balance of populations present. Other specific impacts are on animal mating, spawning, egg and larvae viability, juvenile survival and plant productivity. Some researches show surface runoff of pesticides, such as DDT, can alter the gender of fish species genetically, which transforms male into female fish.[9]</p><p>Surface runoff occurring within forests can supply lakes with high loads of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus leading to eutrophication. Runoff waters within coniferous forests are also enriched with humic acids and can lead to humification of water bodies [10] Additionally, high standing and young islands in the tropics and subtropics can undergo high soil erosion rates and also contribute large material fluxes to the coastal ocean. Such land derived runoff of sediment nutrients, carbon, and contaminants can have large impacts on global biogeochemical cycles and marine and coastal ecosystems.[11]</p><p>In the case of groundwater, the main issue is contamination of drinking water, if the aquifer is abstracted for human use. Regarding soil contamination, runoff waters can have two important pathways of concern. Firstly, runoff water can extract soil contaminants and carry them in the form of water pollution to even more sensitive aquatic habitats. Secondly, runoff can deposit contaminants on pristine soils, creating health or ecological consequences.</p><p>Agricultural issues[edit]</p><p>The other context of agricultural issues involves the transport of agricultural chemicals (nitrates, phosphates, pesticides, herbicides etc.) via surface runoff. This result occurs when chemical use is excessive or poorly timed with respect to high precipitation. The resulting contaminated runoff represents not only a waste of agricultural chemicals, but also an environmental threat to downstream ecosystems.</p><h3>Flooding[edit]</h3><p>Flooding occurs when a watercourse is unable to convey the quantity of runoff flowing downstream. The frequency with which this occurs is described by a return period. Flooding is a natural process, which maintains ecosystem composition and processes, but it can also be altered by land use changes such as river engineering. Floods can be both beneficial to societies or cause damage. Agriculture along the Nile floodplain took advantage of the seasonal flooding that deposited nutrients beneficial for crops. However, as the number and susceptibility of settlements increase, flooding increasingly becomes a natural hazard. In urban areas, surface runoff is the primary cause of urban flooding, known for its repetitive and costly impact on communities.[12] Adverse impacts span loss of life, property damage, contamination of water supplies, loss of crops, and social dislocation and temporary homelessness. Floods are among the most devastating of natural disasters.</p><h2>Mitigation and treatment[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/North-Bend-Uplands-Runoff-pond-3942.jpg/220px-North-Bend-Uplands-Runoff-pond-3942.jpg" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Runoff holding ponds (Uplands neighborhood of North Bend, Washington)</p><p>Mitigation of adverse impacts of runoff can take several forms:</p><p>Land use controls. Many world regulatory agencies have encouraged research on methods of minimizing total surface runoff by avoiding unnecessary hardscape.[13] Many municipalities have produced guidelines and codes (zoning and related ordinances) for land developers that encourage minimum width sidewalks, use of pavers set in earth for driveways and walkways and other design techniques to allow maximum water infiltration in urban settings. An example land use control program can be seen in the city of Santa Monica, California.[14]</p><p>Further information: Low-impact development (Canada/US)
					Further information: Rainwater harvesting</p><p>Erosion controls have appeared since medieval times when farmers realized the importance of contour farming to protect soil resources. Beginning in the 1950s these agricultural methods became increasingly more sophisticated. In the 1960s some state and local governments began to focus their efforts on mitigation of construction runoff by requiring builders to implement erosion and sediment controls (ESCs). This included such techniques as: use of straw bales and barriers to slow runoff on slopes, installation of silt fences, programming construction for months that have less rainfall and minimizing extent and duration of exposed graded areas. Montgomery County, Maryland implemented the first local government sediment control program in 1965, and this was followed by a statewide program in Maryland in 1970.[15]</p><p>Flood control programs as early as the first half of the twentieth century became quantitative in predicting peak flows of riverine systems. Progressively strategies have been developed to minimize peak flows and also to reduce channel velocities. Some of the techniques commonly applied are: provision of holding ponds (also called detention basins) to buffer riverine peak flows, use of energy dissipators in channels to reduce stream velocity and land use controls to minimize runoff.[16]</p><p>Chemical use and handling. Following enactment of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 1976, and later the Water Quality Act of 1987, states and cities have become more vigilant in controlling the containment and storage of toxic chemicals, thus preventing releases and leakage. Methods commonly applied are: requirements for double containment of underground storage tanks, registration of hazardous materials usage, reduction in numbers of allowed pesticides and more stringent regulation of fertilizers and herbicides in landscape maintenance. In many industrial cases, pretreatment of wastes is required, to minimize escape of pollutants into sanitary or stormwater sewers.</p><p>The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) requires that local governments in urbanized areas (as defined by the Census Bureau) obtain stormwater discharge permits for their drainage systems.[17][18] Essentially this means that the locality must operate a stormwater management program for all surface runoff that enters the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). EPA and state regulations and related publications outline six basic components that each local program must contain:</p><p>Other property owners which operate storm drain systems similar to municipalities, such as state highway systems, universities, military bases and prisons, are also subject to the MS4 permit requirements.</p><h2>Measurement and mathematical modeling[edit]</h2><p>Runoff is analyzed by using mathematical models in combination with various water quality sampling methods. Measurements can be made using continuous automated water quality analysis instruments targeted on pollutants such as specific organic or inorganic chemicals, pH, turbidity etc. or targeted on secondary indicators such as dissolved oxygen. Measurements can also be made in batch form by extracting a single water sample and conducting any number of chemical or physical tests on that sample.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the 1950s or earlier hydrology transport models appeared to calculate quantities of runoff, primarily for flood forecasting. Beginning in the early 1970s computer models were developed to analyze the transport of runoff carrying water pollutants, which considered dissolution rates of various chemicals, infiltration into soils and ultimate pollutant load delivered to receiving waters. One of the earliest models addressing chemical dissolution in runoff and resulting transport was developed in the early 1970s under contract to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[19] This computer model formed the basis of much of the mitigation study that led to strategies for land use and chemical handling controls.</p><p>Other computer models have been developed (such as the DSSAM Model) that allow surface runoff to be tracked through a river course as reactive water pollutants. In this case the surface runoff may be considered to be a line source of water pollution to the receiving waters.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor, so that the water condenses and precipitates. Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud. Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called showers.[3]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain. This process is typically active when freezing rain is occurring. A stationary front is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the foci for forcing and rising air. Provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content, the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds, namely stratus and cumulonimbus. Eventually, the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects. Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones. Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy. Thundersnow is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.</p><p>Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for depositing the fresh water on the planet. Approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres (121,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi) of water falls as precipitation each year; 398,000 cubic kilometres (95,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi) of it over the oceans and 107,000 cubic kilometres (26,000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi) over land.[4] Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres (39&nbsp;in), but over land it is only 715 millimetres (28.1&nbsp;in). Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.</p><p>Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies, e.g. when it gets cold, Mars has precipitation which most likely takes the form of frost, rather than rain or snow.[5]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Types[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Precipitation types</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/FoggDam-NT.jpg/220px-FoggDam-NT.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>A thunderstorm with heavy precipitation</p><p>Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet.

Mixtures of different types of precipitation, including types in different categories, can fall simultaneously. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle. Rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass is called freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, ice needles, ice pellets, hail, and graupel.[10]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>How the air becomes saturated[edit]</h2><h3>Cooling air to its dew point[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Regnbyge.jpg/220px-Regnbyge.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Late-summer rainstorm in Denmark</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Lenticular_Cloud_in_Wyoming_0034b.jpg/220px-Lenticular_Cloud_in_Wyoming_0034b.jpg" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Lenticular cloud forming due to mountains over Wyoming</p><p>The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water.[11] Water vapour normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. An elevated portion of a frontal zone forces broad areas of lift, which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.[12]</p><p>There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands.[13] The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,[14] usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath.[15] Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.[16]</p><h3>Adding moisture to the air[edit]</h3><p>The main ways water vapour is added to the air are: wind convergence into areas of upward motion,[8] precipitation or virga falling from above,[17] daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land,[18] transpiration from plants,[19] cool or dry air moving over warmer water,[20] and lifting air over mountains.[21]</p><h2>Formation[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Water cycle</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Water_cycle.png/220px-Water_cycle.png" width="220" height="151"><br><p>Condensation and coalescence are important parts of the water cycle.</p><h3>Raindrops[edit]</h3><p>Coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets, or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal, which is known as the Bergeron process. The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do not fall out of the sky; precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.[22]</p><p>Raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 millimetres (0.0039&nbsp;in) to 9 millimetres (0.35&nbsp;in) mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Contrary to the cartoon pictures of raindrops, their shape does not resemble a teardrop.[23] Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.[24][25] Rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops.[26] The METAR code for rain is RA, while the coding for rain showers is SHRA.[27]</p><h3>Ice pellets[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ice pellets</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Sleet_on_the_ground.jpg/220px-Sleet_on_the_ground.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>An accumulation of ice pellets</p><p>Ice pellets or sleet are a form of precipitation consisting of small, translucent balls of ice. Ice pellets are usually (but not always) smaller than hailstones.[28] They often bounce when they hit the ground, and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain. The METAR code for ice pellets is PL.[27]</p><p>Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing air both above and below. This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer. As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing rain will be the result at the surface. A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season,[29] but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Hail[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Hail</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Granizo.jpg/220px-Granizo.jpg" width="220" height="143"><br><p>A large hailstone, about 6 centimetres (2.4&nbsp;in) in diameter</p><p>Like other precipitation, hail forms in storm clouds when supercooled water droplets freeze on contact with condensation nuclei, such as dust or dirt. The storm's updraft blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud. The updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are lifted again. Hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres (0.20&nbsp;in) or more.[30] Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least 6.4 millimetres (0.25&nbsp;in). GR is derived from the French word grêle. Smaller-sized hail, as well as snow pellets, use the coding of GS, which is short for the French word grésil.[27] Stones just larger than golf ball-sized are one of the most frequently reported hail sizes.[31] Hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres (6&nbsp;in) and weigh more than 500 grams (1&nbsp;lb).[32] In large hailstones, latent heat released by further freezing may melt the outer shell of the hailstone. The hailstone then may undergo 'wet growth', where the liquid outer shell collects other smaller hailstones.[33] The hailstone gains an ice layer and grows increasingly larger with each ascent. Once a hailstone becomes too heavy to be supported by the storm's updraft, it falls from the cloud.[34]</p><h3>Snowflakes[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Snowflake</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Snowflake_-_Microphotograph_by_artgeek.jpg/170px-Snowflake_-_Microphotograph_by_artgeek.jpg" width="170" height="157"><br><p>Snowflake viewed in an optical microscope</p><p>Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 µm in diameter) freeze. Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers in size at the expense of the water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapour causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.[35] Guinness World Records list the world's largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 38&nbsp;cm (15&nbsp;inches) wide.[36] The exact details of the sticking mechanism remain a subject of research.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.[37] The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed.[35] Rarely, at a temperature of around -2&nbsp;°C (28&nbsp;°F), snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry—triangular snowflakes.[38] The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing. No two snowflakes are alike,[39] which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground.[40] The METAR code for snow is SN, while snow showers are coded SHSN.[27]</p><h3>Diamond dust[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Diamond dust</p><p>Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching -40&nbsp;°C (-40&nbsp;°F) due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air.[41] They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape.[42] The METAR identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is IC.[27]</p><h2>Causes[edit]</h2><h3>Frontal activity[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Weather fronts</p><p>Stratiform or dynamic precipitation occurs as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as over surface cold fronts, and over and ahead of warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones.[43] A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.[44] Precipitation may occur on celestial bodies other than Earth. When it gets cold, Mars has precipitation that most likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.[5]</p><h3>Convection[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Konvektionsregen.jpg/220px-Konvektionsregen.jpg" width="220" height="157"><br><p>Convective precipitation</p><p>Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.[25][43] Graupel and hail indicate convection.[45] In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.[46]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Orographic effects[edit]</h3><p>See also: Orographic lift and Precipitation types</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Steigungsregen.jpg/220px-Steigungsregen.jpg" width="220" height="163"><br><p>Orographic precipitation</p><p>Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.[21]</p><p>In Hawaii, Mount Wai?ale?ale, on the island of Kauai, is notable for its extreme rainfall, as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth, with 12,000 millimetres (460&nbsp;in).[47] Storm systems affect the state with heavy rains between October and March. Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (Ko?olau) and leeward (Kona) regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.[48]</p><p>In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.[49] The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.[50][51] Similarly, in Asia, the Himalaya mountains create an obstacle to monsoons which leads to extremely high precipitation on the southern side and lower precipitation levels on the northern side.</p><h3>Snow[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Snow</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Snow_Clouds_in_Korea.jpg/220px-Snow_Clouds_in_Korea.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Lake-effect snow bands near the Korean Peninsula</p><p>Extratropical cyclones can bring cold and dangerous conditions with heavy rain and snow with winds exceeding 119&nbsp;km/h (74&nbsp;mph),[52] (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation that is associated with their warm front is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary which condenses as it cools and produces precipitation within an elongated band,[53] which is wide and stratiform, meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds.[54] When moist air tries to dislodge an arctic air mass, overrunning snow can result within the poleward side of the elongated precipitation band. In the Northern Hemisphere, poleward is towards the North Pole, or north. Within the Southern Hemisphere, poleward is towards the South Pole, or south.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands. Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13&nbsp;°C or 23&nbsp;°F) between the water surface and the air above.[55] Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.[56]</p><p>In mountainous areas, heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes, which in cold conditions, falls in the form of snow. Because of the ruggedness of terrain, forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge.[57]</p><h3>Within the tropics[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Wet season
					See also: Monsoon and Tropical cyclone</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e5/Cairns_climate.svg/220px-Cairns_climate.svg.png" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Rainfall distribution by month in Cairns showing the extent of the wet season at that location</p><p>The wet, or rainy, season is the time of year, covering one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls.[58] The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.[59] Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.[60] Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.[61] Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season.[24] When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves,[62] freshwater quality improves,[63][64] and vegetation grows significantly. Soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases.[24] Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.[65]</p><p>Tropical cyclones, a source of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counterclockwise (northern hemisphere).[66] Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.[67] Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.[68]</p><h3>Large-scale geographical distribution[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>See also: Earth rainfall climatology</p><p>On the large scale, the highest precipitation amounts outside topography fall in the tropics, closely tied to the Intertropical Convergence Zone, itself the ascending branch of the Hadley cell. Mountainous locales near the equator in Colombia are amongst the wettest places on Earth.[69] North and south of this are regions of descending air that form subtropical ridges where precipitation is low;[70] the land surface underneath is usually arid, which forms most of the Earth's deserts.[71] An exception to this rule is in Hawaii, where upslope flow due to the trade winds lead to one of the wettest locations on Earth.[72] Otherwise, the flow of the Westerlies into the Rocky Mountains lead to the wettest, and at elevation snowiest,[73] locations within North America. In Asia during the wet season, the flow of moist air into the Himalayas leads to some of the greatest rainfall amounts measured on Earth in northeast India.</p><h2>Measurement[edit]</h2><p>See also: Rain gauge, Disdrometer, and Snow gauge</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/250mm_Rain_Gauge.jpg/130px-250mm_Rain_Gauge.jpg" width="130" height="276"><br><p>Standard rain gauge</p><p>The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;in) plastic and 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;in) metal varieties.[74] The inner cylinder is filled by 25&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;in) of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25&nbsp;mm (0.01&nbsp;in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25&nbsp;mm (0.01&nbsp;in) markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. These gauges are used in the winter by removing the funnel and inner cylinder and allowing snow and freezing rain to collect inside the outer cylinder. Some add anti-freeze to their gauge so they do not have to melt the snow or ice that falls into the gauge.[75] Once the snowfall/ice is finished accumulating, or as 300&nbsp;mm (12&nbsp;in) is approached, one can either bring it inside to melt, or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder, keeping track of the warm fluid added, which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once all the ice/snow is melted.[76]</p><p>Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.[77] The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow. Attempts to compensate for snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing. Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow, but again, the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.[78]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>When a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as CoCoRAHS or GLOBE.[79][80] If a network is not available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement.[81]</p><h3>Hydrometeor definition[edit]</h3><p>A concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor. Bits of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors. Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, haze, fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors. All precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground. Particles blown from the Earth's surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors.[82]</p><h3>Satellite estimates[edit]</h3><p>Although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases, social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.[83]</p><p>Satellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitation—recording various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The sensors are almost exclusively passive, recording what they see, similar to a camera, in contrast to active sensors (radar, lidar) that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed.</p><p>Satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories. Thermal infrared (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the IR data.[84]</p><p>The second category of sensor channels is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz to a few hundred GHz. Channels up to about 37&nbsp;GHz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors (rain and drizzle) in the lower parts of clouds, with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy. Channels above 37&nbsp;GHz display emission signals, but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors (snow, graupel, etc.) to scatter microwave radiant energy. Satellites such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates.</p><p>Additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However, most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources. [85]</p><h3>Satellite data sets[edit]</h3><p>The IR estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales, but are available very frequently (15 minutes or more often) from satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit. IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous convection—such as the tropics—and becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid- and high-latitude regions. The more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for IR. However, microwave sensors fly only on low Earth orbit satellites, and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours. This several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Since the late 1990s, several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites' sensors, seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets. The goal is to provide best estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space grid, usually for as much of the globe as possible. In some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized, which is the Climate Data Record standard.</p><p>In other cases, the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the true precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.</p><p>The work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats, time/space grids, periods of record and regions of coverage, input datasets, and analysis procedures, as well as many different forms of dataset version designators.[86] In many cases, one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use.</p><h2>Return period[edit]</h2><p>See also: 100-year flood</p><p>The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the return period or frequency.[87] The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location.[88] The term 1 in 10&nbsp;year storm describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10&nbsp;years, so it has a 10&nbsp;percent likelihood any given year. The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. The term 1 in 100&nbsp;year storm describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1&nbsp;percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event. As with all probability events, it is possible though unlikely to have two 1 in 100&nbsp;Year Storms in a single year.[89]</p><h2>Role in Köppen climate classification[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Köppen climate classification</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/World_Koppen_Classification_%28without_labels_and_title%29.svg/290px-World_Koppen_Classification_%28without_labels_and_title%29.svg.png" width="290" height="140"><br><p>Updated Köppen-Geiger climate map[90]</p><p>The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000&nbsp;mm (69 and 79&nbsp;in).[91] A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with rainfall between 750 and 1,270&nbsp;mm (30 and 50&nbsp;in) a year. They are widespread on Africa, and are also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia.[92] The humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall (and sometimes snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones.[93] Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between latitudes 20° and 40° degrees away from the equator.[94]</p><p>An oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.[95] The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.[96] A steppe is a dry grassland.[97] Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.[98]</p><h2>Effect on agriculture[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Heavy_Rains_in_Southern_Japan.gif/220px-Heavy_Rains_in_Southern_Japan.gif" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Rainfall estimates for southern Japan and the surrounding region from July 20 to 27, 2009.</p><p>Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on agriculture. All plants need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion,[99] while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth.[100] Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water,[101] while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.</p><p>In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.[24] Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.[102] Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.[65]</p><h2>Changes due to global warming[edit]</h2><p>See also: Global warming</p><p>Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation. Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or both). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South (11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25%).[103]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Changes due to urban heat island[edit]</h2><p>See also: Urban heat island</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Atlanta_thermal.jpg/220px-Atlanta_thermal.jpg" width="220" height="154"><br><p>Image of Atlanta, Georgia, showing temperature distribution, with hot areas appearing white</p><p>The urban heat island warms cities 0.6 to 5.6&nbsp;°C (1.1 to 10.1&nbsp;°F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between 32 to 64 kilometres (20 to 40&nbsp;mi) downwind of cities, compared with upwind.[104] Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.[105]</p><h2>Forecasting[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: Probability of precipitation and Quantitative precipitation forecast</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Rita5dayqpf.png/220px-Rita5dayqpf.png" width="220" height="114"><br><p>Example of a five-day rainfall forecast from the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center</p><p>The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.[106] A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail.[107] Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States.[108] Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height.[109] QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis.[110] Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within six to seven hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.[111]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

The groundwater then travels through a network of cracks and fissure—openings ranging from intergranular spaces to large caves. The water eventually emerges from below the surface, in the form of a karst spring.</p><p>The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a confined aquifer in which the recharge area of the spring water table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring water forced to the surface by elevated sources are artesian wells. This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a 300-foot-deep (91&nbsp;m) cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower elevation opening.</p><p>Non-artesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Still other springs are the result of pressure from an underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic activity.

Factors that affect the recharge include the size of the area in which groundwater is captured, the amount of precipitation, the size of capture points, and the size of the spring outlet. Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and losing streams. In some cases entire creeks seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. Grand Gulf State Park in Missouri is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system. The water emerges 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) away, forming some of the discharge of Mammoth Spring in Arkansas. Human activity may also affect a spring's discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.[2]</p><h3>Classification[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/La_Sorgue%2C_Fontaine-de-Vaucluse.JPG/220px-La_Sorgue%2C_Fontaine-de-Vaucluse.JPG" width="220" height="167"><br><p>Fontaine de Vaucluse or Spring of Vaucluse in France discharges about 470&nbsp;million US gallons (1,800,000&nbsp;m3) of water per day at a rate of 727 cubic feet (21 m3) per second.</p><p>Springs are often classified by the volume of the water they discharge. The largest springs are called first-magnitude, defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 2800 liters or 100 cubic feet (2.8&nbsp;m3) of water per second. Some locations contain many first-magnitude springs, such as Florida where there are at least 27 known to be that size; the Missouri and Arkansas Ozarks, which contain 10[3][4] known of first-magnitude; and 11[5] more in the Thousand Springs area along the Snake River in Idaho.

This may give the water flavor and even carbon dioxide bubbles, depending on the nature of the geology through which it passes. This is why spring water is often bottled and sold as mineral water, although the term is often the subject of deceptive advertising. Springs that contain significant amounts of minerals are sometimes called 'mineral springs'. (Springs without such mineral content, meanwhile, are sometimes distinguished as 'sweet springs'.) Springs that contain large amounts of dissolved sodium salts, mostly sodium carbonate, are called 'soda springs'. Many resorts have developed around mineral springs and are known as spa towns.</p><p>Water from springs is usually clear. However some springs may be colored by the minerals that are dissolved in the water. For instance, water heavy with iron or tannins will have an orange color.[1]</p><p>In parts of the United States a stream carrying the outflow of a spring to a nearby primary stream may be called a spring branch or run. Groundwater tends to maintain a relatively long-term average temperature of its aquifer; so flow from a spring may be cooler than a summer day, but remain unfrozen in the winter. The cool water of a spring and its branch may harbor species such as certain trout that are otherwise ill-suited to a warmer local climate.</p><h2>Uses[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Maramec_Spring_fishing_ls.jpg/220px-Maramec_Spring_fishing_ls.jpg" width="220" height="74"><br><p>Trout fishing on Maramec Spring in Missouri.</p><p>Springs have been used for a variety of human needs including drinking water, domestic water supply, irrigation, mills, navigation, and electricity generation.

In medieval Europe, holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term holy well is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the local area. This can take the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the spring water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Notable springs[edit]</h2><p>Asia:</p><p>Europe:</p><p>North America:</p><p>Oceania:</p><p>South America:</p><h3>Citations[edit]</h3><h3> [edit]</h3><p> Media related to Springs at Wikimedia Commons</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.[3][4] The word sea is often used interchangeably with ocean in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.[5]</p><p>Saline water covers approximately 360,000,000&nbsp;km2 (140,000,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere.[6] The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored.[6] The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100&nbsp;ft).[7][8][9]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As the world ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to all known life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The world ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because much of it is unexplored, the number of species that exist is much larger, possibly over two million.[10] The origin of Earth's oceans remains unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.</p><p>Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.[11][12]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><p>The word «&nbsp;ocean&nbsp;» comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/o?'si??n?s/; Greek: ??ea???

Greek Okeanós has been compared to the Vedic epithet a-sáyana-, predicated of the dragon V?tra-, who captured the cows/rivers.

In 2005, scientists announced that for the first time, they had obtained photographic evidence of this glow.[32] It is most likely caused by bioluminescence.[33][34][35]</p><h3>Oceanic zones</h3><br><img alt="Drawing showing divisions according to depth and distance from shore" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Oceanic_divisions.svg/400px-Oceanic_divisions.svg.png" width="400" height="300"><br><p>The major oceanic zones, based on depth and biophysical conditions</p><p>Oceanographers divide the ocean into different zones by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone includes all open ocean regions, and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200&nbsp;m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Because plants require photosynthesis, life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above (see marine snow) or find another energy source. Hydrothermal vents are the primary source of energy in what is known as the aphotic zone (depths exceeding 200&nbsp;m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the epipelagic.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
					<div class="content"><p>The pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature. The mesopelagic is the uppermost region. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of 12&nbsp;°C (54&nbsp;°F), which, in the tropics generally lies at 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300&nbsp;ft). Next is the bathypelagic lying between 10 and 4&nbsp;°C (50 and 39&nbsp;°F), typically between 700–1,000 meters (2,300–3,300&nbsp;ft) and 2,000–4,000 meters (6,600–13,100&nbsp;ft), lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the abyssopelagic, whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 meters (20,000&nbsp;ft). The last zone includes the deep oceanic trench, and is known as the hadalpelagic. This lies between 6,000–11,000 meters (20,000–36,000&nbsp;ft) and is the deepest oceanic zone.</p><p>The benthic zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about 4,000 meters (13,000&nbsp;ft). The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000&nbsp;m. Lastly, the hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.</p><p>The pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions: the neritic zone and the oceanic zone. The neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the continental shelves whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water.</p><p>In contrast, the littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.</p><p>The ocean can be divided into three density zones: the surface zone, the pycnocline, and the deep zone. The surface zone, also called the mixed layer, refers to the uppermost density zone of the ocean. Temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action. The surface zone contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic zone. The surface zone has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2% of the total volume of ocean water. The surface zone usually ranges between depths of 500 feet (150&nbsp;m) to 3,300 feet (1,000&nbsp;m) below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the surface zone can be entirely non-existent. The surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature. The pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density surface zone above from the higher-density deep zone below. The pycnocline represents approximately 18% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean. The deep zone usually begins at depths below 3,300 feet (1,000&nbsp;m) in mid-latitudes. The deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth. The deep zone represents approximately 80% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone contains relatively colder and stable water.</p><p>If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth, it contains a thermocline. The tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes. Polar waters, which receive relatively little solar energy, are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths. Below the thermocline, water is very cold, ranging from -1&nbsp;°C to 3&nbsp;°C. Because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water, the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9&nbsp;°C.[citation needed] If a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth, it contains a halocline. If a zone undergoes a strong, vertical chemistry gradient with depth, it contains a chemocline.</p><p>The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline.</p><h3>Exploration</h3><br><img alt="False color photo" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Ocean_gravity_map.gif/350px-Ocean_gravity_map.gif" width="350" height="207"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Map of large underwater features (1995, NOAA)</p><p>Ocean travel by boat dates back to prehistoric times, but only in modern times has extensive underwater travel become possible.</p><p>The deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean near the Northern Mariana Islands.

Tidal currents are in phase with the tide, hence are quasiperiodic, they may fomulate various knots in certain places, most notably around headlands. Non periodic currents have for origin the waves, wind and different densities.</p><p>The wind and waves create surface currents (designated as «&nbsp;drift currents&nbsp;»). These currents can decompose in one quasi permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under the effect of rapid waves movement (at the echelon of a couple of seconds).).[36] The quasi permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.[37]</p><p>This acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the Thermocline.[38]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In the deep however, maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the salinity between water density masses.</p><p>In littoral zones, breaking wave is so intense and the depth measurement so low, that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots.</p><h3>Climate</h3><br><img alt="World map with colored, directed lines showing how water moves through the oceans. Cold deep water rises and warms in the central Pacific and in the Indian, whereas warm water sinks and cools near Greenland in the North Atlantic and near Antarctica in the South Atlantic." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png/200px-Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png" width="200" height="125"><br><p>A map of the global thermohaline circulation; blue represent deep-water currents, whereas red represent surface currents</p><p>Ocean currents greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the polar regions. Transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, winds may carry them inland. Surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation. It plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in sea ice regulation. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's energy budget. In so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface, it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.</p><p>For a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under global warming, see shutdown of thermohaline circulation.</p><p>It is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that the climate of Western Europe is so temperate. An alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin, and because atmospheric waves bring warm air north from the subtropics.[39][40]</p><p>The Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles that continent, influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans.</p><p>One of the most dramatic forms of weather occurs over the oceans: tropical cyclones (also called typhoons and hurricanes depending upon where the system forms).</p><h3>Biology</h3><p>Further information: Marine biology</p><p>The ocean has a significant effect on the biosphere. Oceanic evaporation, as a phase of the water cycle, is the source of most rainfall, and ocean temperatures determine climate and wind patterns that affect life on land. Life within the ocean evolved 3 billion years prior to life on land. Both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the biodiversity of the plants and animals present in each region.[41]</p><p>Lifeforms native to the ocean include:</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In addition, many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans. For instance, seabirds are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans. They feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water, many only going on land for breeding. Other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are penguins, seagulls and pelicans. Seven species of turtles, the sea turtles, also spend most of their time in the oceans.</p><h3>Gases</h3><h3>Surface</h3><h3>Mixing time</h3><p>The residence time is the amount of an element in the ocean divided by the rate at which that element is added to (or removed from) the ocean.</p><p>The mean oceanic mixing time is thought to be approximately 1,600 years. If a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean, on average, longer than the oceanic mixing time, then that element is assumed to be homogeneously spread throughout the ocean. As a result, because the major salts have a residence time that is longer than 1,600 years, the ratio of major salts is thought to be unchanging across the ocean. This constant ratio is often referred to as Forchhammer's principle or the principle of constant proportions.</p><h3>Salinity</h3><p>A zone of rapid salinity increase with depth is called a halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around -1.9&nbsp;°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, as is the case in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, as is the case in tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.[55]</p><p>Salinity can be calculated using the chlorinity, which is a measure of the total mass of halogen ions (includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in seawater. By international agreement, the following formula is used to determine salinity:</p><p>Salinity (in ‰) = 1.80655 × Chlorinity (in ‰)</p><p>The average chlorinity is about 19.2‰, and, thus, the average salinity is around 34.7‰ [55]</p><h3>Absorption of light</h3><h3>Economic value</h3><p>The oceans are essential to transportation. This is because most of the world's goods move by ship between the world's seaports.[citation needed] Oceans are also the major supply source for the fishing industry. Some of the major harvests are shrimp, fish, crabs, and lobster.[6]</p><h3>Waves and swell</h3><p>Further information: Wind wave

The possibility of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune having hot, highly compressed, supercritical water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised. Although their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz and Ingersall ruled out the possibility of such a water ocean existing on Neptune,[59] though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.[60]</p><p>The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered by water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic (much of it residing in the ice caps). The possibility continues to be studied along with reasons for their apparent disappearance. Astronomers think that Venus had liquid water and perhaps oceans in its very early history.[citation needed] If they existed, all later vanished via resurfacing.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Natural satellites</h3><p>A global layer of liquid water thick enough to decouple the crust from the mantle is thought to be present on the natural satellites Titan, Europa, Enceladus and, with less certainty, Callisto, Ganymede[61][62] and Triton.[63][64] A magma ocean is thought to be present on Io. Geysers have been found on Saturn's moon Enceladus, possibly originating from about 10 kilometers (6.2&nbsp;mi) deep ocean beneath an ice shell.[56] Other icy moons may also have internal oceans, or may once have had internal oceans that have now frozen.[65]</p><p>Large bodies of liquid hydrocarbons are thought to be present on the surface of Titan, although they are not large enough to be considered oceans and are sometimes referred to as lakes or seas. The Cassini–Huygens space mission initially discovered only what appeared to be dry lakebeds and empty river channels, suggesting that Titan had lost what surface liquids it might have had. Cassini's more recent fly-by of Titan offers radar images that strongly suggest hydrocarbon lakes exist near the colder polar regions. Titan is thought to have a subsurface liquid-water ocean under the ice and hydrocarbon mix that forms its outer crust.</p><h3>Dwarf planets and trans-Neptunian objects</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Ceres_Cutaway-en.svg/220px-Ceres_Cutaway-en.svg.png" width="220" height="177"><br><p>Diagram showing a possible internal structure of Ceres</p><p>Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle and may harbour a liquid-water ocean under its surface.[66][67]</p><p>Not enough is known of the larger trans-Neptunian objects to determine whether they are differentiated bodies capable of supporting oceans, although models of radioactive decay suggest that Pluto,[68] Eris, Sedna, and Orcus have oceans beneath solid icy crusts approximately 100 to 180 km thick.[65]</p><h3>Extrasolar</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/UpsilonAndromedae_D_moons.jpg/220px-UpsilonAndromedae_D_moons.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>Rendering of a hypothetical large extrasolar moon with surface liquid-water oceans</p><p>Some planets and natural satellites outside the Solar System are likely to have oceans, including possible water ocean planets similar to Earth in the habitable zone or liquid-water belt.

Some scientists speculate Kepler-22b may be an ocean-like planet.[70] Models have been proposed for Gliese 581 d that could include surface oceans. Gliese 436 b is speculated to have an ocean of hot ice.[71] Exomoons orbiting planets, particularly gas giants within their parent star's habitable zone may theoretically have surface oceans.</p><p>Terrestrial planets will acquire water during their accretion, some of which will be buried in the magma ocean but most of it will go into a steam atmosphere, and when the atmosphere cools it will collapse on to the surface forming an ocean. There will also be outgassing of water from the mantle as the magma solidifies—this will happen even for planets with a low percentage of their mass composed of water, so super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact.[72]</p><h3>Non-water surface liquids</h3><p>Oceans, seas, lakes and other bodies of liquids can be composed of liquids other than water, for example the hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. The possibility of seas of nitrogen on Triton was also considered but ruled out.[73] There is evidence that the icy surfaces of the moons Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan and Enceladus are shells floating on oceans of very dense liquid water or water–ammonia.[74][75][76][77][78] Earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70% covered in water.[79][80] Extrasolar terrestrial planets that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked and so one half of the planet will be a magma ocean.[81] It is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts.[82] Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface.[83] Where there are suitable temperatures and pressures, volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include ammonia, argon, carbon disulfide, ethane, hydrazine, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, neon, nitrogen, nitric oxide, phosphine, silane, sulfuric acid, and water.[84]</p><p>Supercritical fluids, although not liquids, do share various properties with liquids. Underneath the thick atmospheres of the planets Uranus and Neptune, it is expected that these planets are composed of oceans of hot high-density fluid mixtures of water, ammonia and other volatiles.[85] The gaseous outer layers of Jupiter and Saturn transition smoothly into oceans of supercritical hydrogen.[86][87] The atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide, which is a supercritical fluid at its surface.</p><h2>See also</h2><p>On other bodies:</p><h2>References</h2><h2> </h2><h2> </h2><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

It rises in the northeastern part of Guton Mount at an elevation of 3,648&nbsp;m (11,969&nbsp;ft). Descending from the mountains for 7&nbsp;km (4.3&nbsp;mi), the river receives its tributary the Khalakhur River flowing down from an elevation of 3,730&nbsp;m (12,240&nbsp;ft).[2][4] The length of the river is 216&nbsp;km (134&nbsp;mi), its basin 5,000&nbsp;km2 (1,900&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The elevated and midsections of the river from through the territory of Russia, lower sections flow through Azerbaijan making up the Russian-Azerbaijani border.

Once the river is in the open Caspian basin, it splits some of its parts into Tahirçay (34&nbsp;km (21&nbsp;mi)) and Ugar 28&nbsp;km (17&nbsp;mi) rivers on Azerbaijani territory.

The lateral confines or channel margins are known as the stream banks or river banks, during all but flood stage. Under certain conditions a river can branch from one stream bed to multiple stream beds.[1] A flood occurs when a stream overflows its banks and flows onto its flood plain. As a general rule, the bed is the part of the channel up to the normal water line, and the banks are that part above the normal water line. However, because water flow varies, this differentiation is subject to local interpretation. Usually, the bed is kept clear of terrestrial vegetation, whereas the banks are subjected to water flow only during unusual or perhaps infrequent high water stages and therefore might support vegetation some or much of the time.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Old_Mississippi_riverbed_near_St._Mary%27s.jpg/220px-Old_Mississippi_riverbed_near_St._Mary%27s.jpg" width="220" height="124"><br><p>The old bed of the Mississippi River near Kaskaskia, Illinois, left behind after the river shifted</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Digging_for_drinking_water_in_a_dry_riverbed_%286220146368%29.jpg/220px-Digging_for_drinking_water_in_a_dry_riverbed_%286220146368%29.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>A woman digs in a dry stream bed in Kenya to find water during a drought.</p><p>The nature of any stream bed is always a function of the flow dynamics and the local geologic materials, influenced by that flow. With small streams in mesophytic regions, the nature of the stream bed is strongly responsive to conditions of precipitation runoff. Where natural conditions of either grassland or forest ameliorate peak flows, stream beds are stable, possibly rich, with organic matter and exhibit minimal scour. These streams support a rich biota. Where conditions produce unnatural levels of runoff, such as occurs below roads, the stream beds will exhibit a greater amount of scour, often down to bedrock and banks may be undercut. This process greatly increases watershed erosion and results in thinner soils, upslope from the stream bed, as the channel adjusts to the increase in flow. The stream bed is very complex in terms of erosion. Sediment is transported, eroded and deposited on the stream bed.[2] With global warming there is a fear that the size and shape of riverbeds will change due to increased flood magnitude and frequency. However, one study has shown that the majority of sediment washed out in floods is near-threshold sediment that has been deposited during normal flow and only needs a slightly higher flow to become mobile again. This shows that the stream bed is left mostly unchanged in size and shape.[3]</p><p>
					Beds are usually what would be left once a stream is no longer in existence; the beds are usually well preserved even if they get buried, because the walls and canyons made by the stream usually have hard walls, usually soft sand and debris fill the bed. Dry stream beds are also subject to becoming underground water pockets (buried stream beds only) and flooding by heavy rains and water rising from the ground and may sometimes be part of the rejuvenation of the stream.</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide. The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys. Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, (at least) with respect to the cross section of the slopes or hillsides.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Valley terminology[edit]</h2><p>A valley in its broadest geographic sense is also known as a dale. A valley through which a river runs may also be referred to as a vale. A small, secluded, and often wooded valley is known as a dell or in Scotland as a glen. A wide, flat valley through which a river runs is known in Scotland as a strath. A mountain cove is a small valley, closed at one or both ends, in the central or southern Appalachian Mountains which sometimes results from the erosion of a geologic window. A small valley surrounded by mountains or ridges is sometimes known as a hollow. A deep, narrow valley is known as a cwm (also spelled combe or coombe). Similar geological structures, such as canyons, ravines, gorges, gullies, chines and kloofs, are not usually referred to as valleys. A valley formed by erosion is called an erosional valley; a valley formed by geologic events such as drop faults or the rise of highlands is called a structural valley.[1]</p><h2>River valleys [edit]</h2><p>For a comprehensive list of river valleys, see Category:River valleys.
					Further information: River phenomenon</p><p>A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. However, in the lowest stretch of a river, where it approaches its base level, it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a floodplain.</p><p>Some broad V examples are:</p><p>Some of the first human complex societies originated in river valleys, such as that of the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, Yangtze, Yellow River, Mississippi, and arguably Amazon. In prehistory, the rivers were used as a source of fresh water and food (fish and game), as well as a place to wash and a sewer. The proximity of water moderated temperature extremes and provided a source for irrigation, stimulating the development of agriculture. Most of the first civilizations developed from these river valley communities.</p><h3>Vales [edit]</h3><p>In geography, a vale is a wide river valley, usually with a particularly wide flood plain or flat valley bottom.</p><p>In Southern England, vales commonly occur between the escarpment slopes of pairs of chalk formations, where the chalk dome has been eroded, exposing less resistant underlying rock, usually claystone.</p><h2>Rift valleys[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Rift valley</p><p>Rift valleys, such as the Albertine Rift, are formed by the expansion of the Earth's crust due to tectonic activity beneath the Earth's surface.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Glacial valleys[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Tal-y-llyn-valley-Dolgoch-01.jpg/220px-Tal-y-llyn-valley-Dolgoch-01.jpg" width="220" height="78"><br><p>U-shaped valley on the Afon Fathew near Dolgoch, Wales</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/YosemiteFromPlane.JPG/220px-YosemiteFromPlane.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Yosemite Valley from an airplane</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Glacial_Valley_MtHoodWilderness.jpg/220px-Glacial_Valley_MtHoodWilderness.jpg" width="220" height="240"><br><p>A glaciated valley in the Mount Hood Wilderness showing a characteristic U-shape, the bottom's rocky 'rubble' accretion and the broad shoulders</p><p>There are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys.</p><h3>U-shaped or trough valley[edit]</h3><p>Main article: U-shaped valley</p><p>A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped and resembles a trough. This trough valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice. Floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape, it is the glacier's size that does. Continuously flowing glaciers – especially in the ice age – and large-sized glaciers carve wide, deep incised valleys, sometimes with valley steps that reflect differing erosion rates.</p><p>Examples of U-shaped valleys are found in every mountainous region that has experienced glaciation, usually during the Pleistocene ice ages. Most present U-shaped valleys started as V-shaped before glaciation. The glaciers carved it out wider and deeper, simultaneously changing the shape. This proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of glaciation and abrasion, which results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. As the ice melts and retreats, the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide, flat floor. A river or stream may remain in the valley. This replaces the original stream or river and is known as a misfit stream because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Other interesting glacially carved valleys include:</p><h3>Tunnel valley[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Tunnel valley</p><p>A tunnel valley is a large, long, U-shaped valley originally cut under the glacial ice near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past glacial ages.[1]</p><p>A tunnel valley can be up to 100&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi) long, 4&nbsp;km (2.5&nbsp;mi) wide, and 400 m (1,300&nbsp;ft) deep (its depth may vary along its length).</p><p>Tunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water. They served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.</p><h3>Meltwater valley[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Urstromtal</p><p>In northern Central Europe, the Scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly uphill against the lie of the land. As a result, its meltwaters flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the North Sea basin, forming huge, flat valleys known as Urstromtäler. Unlike the other forms of glacial valley, these were formed by glacial meltwaters.</p><h2>Transition forms and valley shoulders[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Paria_View_at_Bryce_Canyon_NP.jpg/300px-Paria_View_at_Bryce_Canyon_NP.jpg" width="300" height="91"><br><p>Look from Paria View to a valley in Bryce Canyon, Utah, with very striking shoulders</p><p>Depending on the topography, the rock types and the climate, a lot of transitional forms between V-, U- and plain valleys exist. Their bottoms can be broad or narrow, but characteristic is also the type of valley shoulder. The broader a mountain valley, the lower its shoulders are located in most cases. An important exception are canyons where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley's slope. In the Alps – e.g. the Tyrolean Inn valley – the shoulders are quite low (100–200 meters above the bottom). Many villages are located here (esp. at the sunny side) because the climate is very mild: even in winter when the valley's floor is completely filled with fog, these villages are in sunshine.</p><p>In some stress-tectonic regions of the Rockies or the Alps (e.g. Salzburg) the side valleys are parallel to each other, and additionally they are hanging. The brooks flow into the river in form of deep canyons or waterfalls. Usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders, a special genesis found also at arêtes and glacial cirques, at every Scottish glen, or in a northern fjord.</p><h2>Hanging valleys[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Closeup_of_Bridalveil_Fall_seen_from_Tunnel_View_in_Yosemite_NP.JPG/220px-Closeup_of_Bridalveil_Fall_seen_from_Tunnel_View_in_Yosemite_NP.JPG" width="220" height="285"><br><p>Bridal Veil Falls in Yosemite National Park flowing from a hanging valley.</p><p>A hanging valley is a tributary valley that is higher than the main valley. They are most commonly associated with U-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume. The main glacier erodes a deep U-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier, with a smaller volume of ice, makes a shallower U-shaped valley. Since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same elevation, the shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley. Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley.[2]</p><p>Glaciated terrain is not the only site of hanging streams and valleys. Hanging valleys are also simply the product of varying rates of erosion of the main valley and the tributary valleys. The varying rates of erosion are associated with the composition of the adjacent rocks in the different valley locations. The tributary valleys are eroded and deepened by glaciers or erosion at a slower rate than that of the main valley floor, thus the difference in the two valleys' depth increases over time. The tributary valley composed of more resistant rock then hangs over the main valley.[3]</p><h2>Trough-shaped valleys[edit]</h2><p>Trough-shaped valleys also form in regions of heavy denudation. By contrast, with glacial U-shaped valleys, there is less downward and sideways erosion. The severe slope denudation results in gently sloping valley sides and their transition to the actual valley bottom is unclear. Trough-shaped valleys occur mainly in periglacial regions and in tropical regions of variable wetness. Both climates are dominated by heavy denudation.</p><h2>Valley floors[edit]</h2><p>Usually the bottom of a main valley is broad – independent of the U or V shape. It typically ranges from about one to ten kilometers in width and is commonly filled with mountain sediments. The shape of the floor can be rather horizontal, similar to a flat cylinder, or terraced.</p><p>Side valleys are rather V than U-shaped; near the mouth waterfalls are possible if it is a hanging valley. The location of the villages depends on the across-valley profile, on climate and local traditions, and on the danger of avalanches or landslides. Predominant are places on terraces or alluvial fans if they exist.</p><p>Historic siting of villages within the mainstem valleys, however, have chiefly considered the potential of flooding.</p><h2>Hollows[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Wheat-haHula-ISRAEL2.JPG/220px-Wheat-haHula-ISRAEL2.JPG" width="220" height="163"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Wheat in the Hula Valley, Israel</p><p>A hollow is a small valley or dry stream bed.

										Jump to:					navigation, 					search</p><p>The Nerodimka (Serbian Cyrillic: ?????????; Albanian: Nerodimja, Nerodime), is a river in the Nerodimlje region[1] of Kosovo,[a] a 41&nbsp;km-long left tributary to the Lepenac river. It represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into two seas,[2][1] dividing into two irreversible branches. The left branch flows into the Black Sea, and the right branch flows into the Aegean Sea.[2]</p><p>For other cases see List of unusual drainage systems.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Nerodimka river rises in the Lake Peak and is formed by two main tributaries, one flowing from the Nerodimka mountain and the other one from the Crnoljeva mountain. They join in the village of Nerodime e Epërme (Gornje Nerodimlje). From there it flows to a dam, where the first bifurcation occurs at 42°22'09?N 21°04'49?E? / ?42.369151°N 21.080277°E? / 42.369151; 21.080277. The northern branch flows into the Sitnica river and ultimately into the Black Sea via the Ibar, Morava and Danube rivers; while the main, southern branch joins with another branch of the Nerodimka river and together continue the journey to the Aegean Sea via the Lepenac and Vardar Rivers.[3]</p><p>After the major settlement of southern Kosovo, the town of Ferizaj, the Nerodimka turns south and flows next to the villages of Varoš Selo, Kamena Glava, Stari Kacanik, Stagovo and Runjevo, before it reaches the town of Kacanik and empties into the Lepenac river.</p><p>The bifurcation is actually an artificial phenomenon, as the connection was achieved by digging an artificial canal, but the downstream water flow is still natural.[4][not in citation given] In the 14th century, during the reign of king Milutin, a canal connecting the Sazlija pond and the river Nerodimka was dug, creating an artificial bifurcation,[citation needed] since the Nerodimka flows to the south into the Lepenac river and thus belongs to the Aegean Sea drainage basin, while the Sitnica (which is an outflow of the Sazlija) flows to the north, into the Ibar river and belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. After World War II, the canal was covered with earth again as it was previously mudded as a result of the lack of maintenance.[citation needed]</p><p>These water flows have separate impact in annual temperatures of this region. The average annual temperature is 9.9&nbsp;°C. Warmest months are July and August, with average temperature 18.9&nbsp;°C. The coldest month is January, with an average temperature -2.6&nbsp;°C. Maximum air temperature is 32.5&nbsp;°C in July, while the minimum -14.0&nbsp;°C in January.[5]</p><p>Atmospheric precipitation also plays a role of abundance water in Nerodimka river. The average of rainfalls for every month is 73.3&nbsp;mm. Months with the most rainfalls are April–May, 105.6&nbsp;mm, while at least August with 42.2&nbsp;mm.[citation needed]</p><h2>Development strategies and protection[edit]</h2><p>The bifurcation of Nerodimka is under state protection since 1979, and it is declared as a strict wildlife sanctuary, first category according to (IUCN) [4] Official emblem of the municipality of Ferizaj contains the visual representation of the Nerodimka river bifurcation.</p><p>This phenomenon is attractive for researchers and visitors and has great importance to education, science and tourism.[citation needed] The western part of the city offers ideal conditions for the formation of public green spaces (parks), for the development of tourism and recreation. Branch of Nerodimka River enters within the city, extensive recreational area that is also available to residents of Uroševac bifurcation area, waterfall and the merger of the two rivers.[6]</p><p>The Nerodimka drains an area of 229&nbsp;km² itself, and it is not navigable.</p><h2>Notes and references[edit]</h2><p>Notes:</p><p>References:</p><p>Coordinates: 42°14'N 21°15'E? / ?42.233°N 21.250°E? / 42.233; 21.250</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

Such a connection may be normal (such as the foramen ovale in a fetus's heart) or abnormal (such as the patent foramen ovale in an adult's heart); it may be acquired (such as an arteriovenous fistula) or innate (such as the arteriovenous shunt of a metarteriole); and it may be natural (such as the aforementioned examples) or artificial (such as a surgical anastomosis). The reestablishment of an anastomosis that had become blocked is called a reanastomosis. Anastomoses that are abnormal, whether congenital or acquired, are often called fistulas.</p><p>The term is used in medicine, biology, mycology, geology, geography and architecture.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>Anastomosis: medical or Modern Latin, from Greek ??ast?µ?s??, anastomosis, outlet, opening, Gr ana- up, on, upon, stoma mouth, to furnish with a mouth.[1] Thus the -stom- syllable is cognate with that of stoma in botany or stoma in medicine.</p><h2>Medicine[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Gray1083.png/220px-Gray1083.png" width="220" height="366"><br><p>A network of blood vessels</p><p>An anastomosis is the connection of two normally divergent structures.[2] It refers to connections between blood vessels or between other tubular structures such as loops of intestine.</p><h3>Circulatory[edit]</h3><p>In circulatory anastomoses, many arteries naturally anastomose with each other; for example, the inferior epigastric artery and superior epigastric artery, or the anterior and/or posterior communicating arteries in the Circle of Willis in the brain. The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis (e.g., palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial anastomosis (e.g. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). Anastomoses also form alternative routes around capillary beds in areas that don't need a large blood supply, thus helping regulate systemic blood flow.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Surgical[edit]</h3><p>An example of surgical anastomosis occurs when a segment of intestine is resected and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). The procedure is referred to as intestinal anastomosis. Other examples include Roux-en-Y anastomosis or ureteroureterostomy.</p><h3>Pathological[edit]</h3><p>Pathological anastomosis results from trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually referred to as fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the portal circulation and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, or caput medusae.</p><h2>Biology[edit]</h2><h3>Evolution[edit]</h3><p>In evolution, anastomosis is a recombination of evolutionary lineage. Conventional accounts of evolutionary lineage present themselves as the simple branching out of species into novel forms. Under anastomosis, species might recombine after initial branching out, such as in the case of recent research that shows that ancestral populations along human and chimpanzee lineages may have interbred after an initial branching event.[3] The concept of anastomosis also applies to the theory of symbiogenesis, in which new species emerge from the formation of novel symbiotic relationships.</p><h3>Mycology[edit]</h3><p>In mycology, anastomosis is the fusion between branches of the same or different hyphae.[4] Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials in the form of dissolved ions, hormones, and nucleotides, the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores (i.e. by means of conidial anastomosis tubes), several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in pheromonal recognition or by an unknown recognition system, fusing to form a genetic singular clonal colony that can cover hectares called a genet or just microscopical areas.[5]</p><p>For fungi, anastomosis is also a component of reproduction. In some fungi, two different haploid mating types – if compatible – merge. Somatically, they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference, is that each septated unit is binucleate, containing two unfused nuclei, i.e., one from each parent that eventually undergoes karyogamy and meiosis to complete the sexual cycle.</p><p>Also the term anastomosing is used for mushroom gills which interlink and separate to form a network.[6]</p><h2>Geology[edit]</h2><p>In geology, anastomosis refers to quartz (or other) veins displaying this property, which is often related to shearing in metamorphic regions.[citation needed]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><p>Anastomosing streams consist of multiple channels that divide and reconnect and are separated by semi-permanent banks formed of cohesive material, such that they are unlikely to migrate from one channel position to another. They can be confused with braiding, the splitting of a river by sand bars or hard rocks and some definitions require that an anastomosing river be made up of interconnected channels that enclose floodbasins.[7] Rivers with anastomosed reaches include the Magdalena River in Colombia,[8] the upper Columbia River in British Columbia, Canada,[9] and the upper Narew River in Poland.[10] The term anabranch has been used for segments of anastamosing rivers.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

These tupelo and cypress trees show the high-water mark of flooding.</p><p>A floodplain or flood plain is an area of land adjacent to a stream or river that stretches from the banks of its channel to the base of the enclosing valley walls and experiences flooding during periods of high discharge.[1] The soils usually consist of levees, silts, and sands deposited during floods. Levees are the heaviest materials (usually pebble-size) and they fall in first; silts and sands are finer materials.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Formation[edit]</h2><p>Flood plains are made by a meander eroding sideways as it travels downstream. When a river breaks its banks and floods, it leaves behind layers of alluvium (silt). These gradually build up to create the floor of the flood plain. Floodplains generally contain unconsolidated sediments, often extending below the bed of the stream. These are accumulations of sand, gravel, loam, silt, and/or clay, and are often important aquifers, the water drawn from them being pre-filtered compared to the water in the river.</p><p>Geologically ancient floodplains are often represented in the landscape by fluvial terraces. These are old floodplains that remain relatively high above the present floodplain and indicate former courses of a stream.</p><p>Sections of the Missouri River floodplain taken by the United States Geological Survey show a great variety of material of varying coarseness, the stream bed having been scoured at one place and filled at another by currents and floods of varying swiftness, so that sometimes the deposits are of coarse gravel, sometimes of fine sand or of fine silt. It is probable that any section of such an alluvial plain would show deposits of a similar character.</p><p>The floodplain during its formation is marked by meandering or anastomotic streams, oxbow lakes and bayous, marshes or stagnant pools, and is occasionally completely covered with water. When the drainage system has ceased to act or is entirely diverted for any reason, the floodplain may become a level area of great fertility, similar in appearance to the floor of an old lake. The floodplain differs, however, because it is not altogether flat. It has a gentle slope downstream, and often, for a distance, from the side towards the center.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The floodplain is the natural place for a river to dissipate its energy. Meanders form over the floodplain to slow down the flow of water and when the channel is at capacity the water spills over the floodplain where it is temporarily stored. In terms of flood management the upper part of the floodplain (piedmont zone) is crucial as this is where the flood water control starts. Artificial canalisation of the river here will have a major impact on wider flooding. This is the basis of sustainable flood management.</p><h2>Ecology [edit]</h2><p>Floodplains can support particularly rich ecosystems, both in quantity and diversity. Tugay forests form an ecosystem associated with floodplains, especially in Central Asia. They are a category of riparian zones or systems. A floodplain can contain 100 or even 1,000 times as many species as a river. Wetting of the floodplain soil releases an immediate surge of nutrients: those left over from the last flood, and those that result from the rapid decomposition of organic matter that has accumulated since then. Microscopic organisms thrive and larger species enter a rapid breeding cycle. Opportunistic feeders (particularly birds) move in to take advantage. The production of nutrients peaks and falls away quickly; however the surge of new growth endures for some time. This makes floodplains particularly valuable for agriculture. River flow rates are undergoing change following suit with climate change. This change is a threat to the riparian zones and other flood plain forests. These forests have over time synced their seedling deposits after the spring peaks in flow to best take advantage of the nutrient rich soil generated by peak flow. [2]</p><h2>Interaction with society[edit]</h2><p>See also: River civilization</p><p>Historically, many towns have been built on floodplains, where they are highly susceptible to flooding, for a number of reasons:</p><p>Excluding famines and epidemics, some of the worst natural disasters in history (measured by fatalities) have been river floods, particularly in the Yellow River in China – see list of deadliest floods. The worst of these, and the worst natural disaster (excluding famine and epidemics) were the 1931 China floods, estimated to have killed millions. This had been preceded by the 1887 Yellow River flood, which killed around one million people, and is the second-worst natural disaster in history.</p><p>The extent of floodplain inundation depends in part on the flood magnitude, defined by the return period.</p><p>In the United States the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP offers insurance to properties located within a flood prone area, as defined by the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), which depicts various flood risks for a community. The FIRM typically focuses on delineation of the 100-year flood inundation area, also known within the NFIP as the Special Flood Hazard Area.</p><p>Where a detailed study of a waterway has been done, the 100-year floodplain will also include the floodway, the critical portion of the floodplain which includes the stream channel and any adjacent areas that must be kept free of encroachments that might block flood flows or restrict storage of flood waters. Another commonly encountered term is the Special Flood Hazard Area, which is any area subject to inundation by the 100-year flood.[3] A problem is that any alteration of the watershed upstream of the point in question can potentially affect the ability of the watershed to handle water, and thus potentially affects the levels of the periodic floods. A large shopping center and parking lot, for example, may raise the levels of the 5-year, 100-year, and other floods, but the maps are rarely adjusted, and are frequently rendered obsolete by subsequent development.</p><p>In order for flood-prone property to qualify for government-subsidized insurance, a local community must adopt an ordinance that protects the floodway and requires that new residential structures built in Special Flood Hazard Areas be elevated to at least the level of the 100-year flood. Commercial structures can be elevated or flood proofed to or above this level. In some areas without detailed study information, structures may be required to be elevated to at least two feet above the surrounding grade.[4] Many State and local governments have, in addition, adopted floodplain construction regulations which are more restrictive than those mandated by the NFIP. The U.S. government also sponsors flood hazard mitigation efforts to reduce flood impacts. The Hazard Mitigation Program is one funding source for mitigation projects. A number of whole towns such as English, Indiana, have been completely relocated to remove them from the floodplain.

For other uses, see Delta (disambiguation).</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Sacramento_Delta_at_flood_stage%2C_2009.jpg/220px-Sacramento_Delta_at_flood_stage%2C_2009.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Sacramento (California) Delta at flood stage, early-March 2009</p><p>A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or standing water.[1][2] This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot transport away the supplied sediment. The size and shape of a delta is controlled by the balance between watershed processes that supply sediment and receiving basin processes that redistribute, sequester, and export that sediment.[3][4] The size, geometry, and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution. River deltas are important in human civilization, as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers. They can provide coastline defense and can impact drinking water supply.[5] They are also ecologically important, with different species assemblages depending on their landscape position.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Formation[edit]</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. Of course, the river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[6] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).</p><p>As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, gravity makes the water flow in the most direct course down slope. If the river breaches its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it spills out onto a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.[7] Second, as its slope gets lower, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This makes it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the body of standing water at a steeper slope. Often when the channel does this, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. When these channel-switching events occur, a mature delta develops a distributary network.</p><p>Another way these distributary networks form is from deposition of mouth bars (mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth-bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the Wax Lake Delta.</p><p>In both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position results in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. Alluvial fan deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape.</p><h2>Types of deltas[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Lower_Mississippi_River_landloss_over_time.jpg/220px-Lower_Mississippi_River_landloss_over_time.jpg" width="220" height="142"><br><p>Lower Mississippi River land loss over time</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Mississippi_Delta_Lobes.jpg/220px-Mississippi_Delta_Lobes.jpg" width="220" height="133"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Delta lobe switching in the Mississippi Delta,  4600 yrs BP,  3500 yrs BP,  2800 yrs BP,  1000 yrs BP,  300 yrs BP,  500 yrs BP,  current</p><p>Deltas are typically classified according to the main control on deposition, which is a combination of river, wave, and tidal processes,[8] depending on the strength of each.[9] The other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river.[10]</p><h3>Wave-dominated deltas[edit]</h3><p>In wave dominated deltas, wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta, and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line.[8] The relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin. With a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore, waves will make river deltas smoother. Waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta, causing the delta to retreat.[5] For deltas that form further upriver in an estuary, there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds, tides, river discharge, and delta water levels.[11][12]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Ganges_River_Delta%2C_Bangladesh%2C_India.jpg/220px-Ganges_River_Delta%2C_Bangladesh%2C_India.jpg" width="220" height="215"><br><p>The Ganges Delta in India and Bangladesh is the largest delta in the world and it is also one of the most fertile regions in the world.</p><h3>Tide-dominated deltas[edit]</h3><p>Erosion is also an important control in tide dominated deltas, such as the Ganges Delta, which may be mainly submarine, with prominent sand bars and ridges. This tends to produce a dendritic structure.[13] Tidal deltas behave differently from river- and wave-dominated deltas, which tend to have a few main distributaries. Once a wave- or river- distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there's a lot of water around – such as floods or storm surges. These distributaries slowly silt up at a pretty constant rate until they fizzle out.[13]</p><h3>Gilbert deltas[edit]</h3><p>A Gilbert delta (named after Grove Karl Gilbert) is a specific type of delta formed from coarse sediments, as opposed to gently-sloping muddy deltas such as that of the Mississippi. For example, a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta.[14] [15] While some authors describe both lacustrine and marine locations of Gilbert deltas,[14] others note that their formation is more characteristic of the freshwater lakes, where it is easier for the river water to mix with the lakewater faster (as opposed to the case of a river falling into the sea or a salt lake, where less dense fresh water brought by the river stays on top longer).[16]</p><p>G.K. Gilbert himself first described this type of delta on Lake Bonneville in 1885.[16] Elsewhere, similar structures occur, for example, at the mouths of several creeks that flow into Okanagan Lake in British Columbia and forming prominent peninsulas at Naramata (49°35'30?N 119°35'30?W? / ?49.59167°N 119.59167°W? / 49.59167; -119.59167), Summerland (49°34'23?N 119°37'45?W? / ?49.57306°N 119.62917°W? / 49.57306; -119.62917), or Peachland (49°47'00?N 119°42'45?W? / ?49.78333°N 119.71250°W? / 49.78333; -119.71250).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Tidal freshwater deltas[edit]</h3><p>A tidal freshwater delta[17] is a sedimentary deposit formed at the boundary between an upland stream and an estuary, in the region known as the subestuary.[18] Drowned coastal river valleys that were inundated by rising sea levels during the late Pleistocene and subsequent Holocene tend to have dendritic estuaries with many feeder tributaries. Each tributary mimics this salinity gradient from their brackish junction with the mainstem estuary up to the fresh stream feeding the head of tidal propagation. As a result, the tributaries are considered to be “subestuaries”.The origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas[4] as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting.[19][20] The combination of processes that create a tidal freshwater delta result in a distinct morphology and unique environmental characteristics. Many tidal freshwater deltas that exist today are directly caused by the onset of or changes in historical land use, especially deforestation, intensive agriculture, and urbanization.[21] These ideas are well illustrated by the many tidal freshwater deltas prograding into Chesapeake Bay along the east coastline of the United States. Research has demonstrated that the accumulating sediments in this estuary derive from post-European settlement deforestation, agriculture, and urban development.[22][23][24]</p><h3>Estuaries[edit]</h3><p>Other rivers, particularly those on coasts with significant tidal range, do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an estuary. Notable examples include the Saint Lawrence River and the Tagus estuary.</p><h3>Inland deltas[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/OkavangoDelta.png/220px-OkavangoDelta.png" width="220" height="169"><br><p>Okavango Delta</p><p>In rare cases the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an inverted river delta. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an inland delta, and often occurs on former lake beds. The Inner Niger Delta and Peace–Athabasca Delta are notable examples. The Amazon has also an inland delta before the island of Marajó.</p><p>In some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. Okavango Delta in Botswana is one well-known example.</p><h3>Mega deltas[edit]</h3><p>The generic term mega delta can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the Changjiang (Yangtze), Pearl, Red, Mekong, Irrawaddy, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Indus.</p><h2>Sedimentary structure[edit]</h2><p>The formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three part structure may be seen in small scale by crossbedding.[14][25]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Examples of deltas[edit]</h2><p>The Ganges/Brahmaputra combination delta, which spans most of Bangladesh and empties into the Bay of Bengal, is the world's largest delta.</p><p>The St. Clair River delta, between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan, is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water.</p><p>Other rivers with notable deltas include the:</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/EbroRiverDelta_ISS009-E-09985.jpg/300px-EbroRiverDelta_ISS009-E-09985.jpg" width="300" height="300"><br><p>The Ebre River delta at the Mediterranean Sea</p><h2>Ecological threats to deltas[edit]</h2><p>Human activities, such as the creation of dams for hydroelectric power or to create reservoirs can radically alter delta ecosystems. Dams block sedimentation, which can cause the delta to erode away. The use of water upstream can greatly increase salinity levels as less fresh water flows to meet the salty ocean water. While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the Nile Delta and Colorado River Delta are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water. Construction, irrigation, and land alteration have impacted delta formation. As humans have altered surface roughness, runoff, and groundwater storage, studies have shown river delta retreat. However, historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times where there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there were significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.[28]</p><h2>Deltas in the economy[edit]</h2><p>Ancient deltas are a benefit to the economy due to their well sorted sand and gravel. Sand and gravel is often quarried from these old deltas and used in concrete for highways, buildings, sidewalks, and even landscaping. More than 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are produced in the United States alone.[29] Not all sand and gravel quarries are former deltas, but for ones that are, a lot of the sorting is already done by the power of water.</p><p>As lowlands often adjacent to urban areas, deltas often comprise extensive industrial and commercial areas as well as agricultural land. These uses are often in conflict. The Fraser Delta in British Columbia, Canada, includes the Vancouver Airport and the Roberts Bank Superport and the Annacis Island industrial zone, and a mix of commercial, residential and agricultural land. Space is so limited in the Lower Mainland region, and in British Columbia in general, which is very mountainous, that the Agricultural Land Reserve was created to preserve agricultural land for food production.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Deltas on Mars[edit]</h2><p>Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had large amounts of water. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range. Below are pictures of a few.[30]</p><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

									For other uses, see Estuary (disambiguation).</p><p>An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.[1]</p><p>Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments. They are subject both to marine influences—such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water—and to riverine influences—such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.[2]</p><p>Most existing estuaries formed during the Holocene epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000–12,000 years ago.[3] Estuaries are typically classified according to their geomorphological features or to water-circulation patterns. They can have many different names, such as bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or sounds, although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline.</p><p>The banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the world, with about 60% of the world's population living along estuaries and the coast.[citation needed] As a result, many estuaries suffer degradation by many factors, including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation, overgrazing, and other poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands; eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.[3][4]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Definition[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/New_York_STS058-081-038.jpg/220px-New_York_STS058-081-038.jpg" width="220" height="220"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Exe_estuary_from_balloon.jpg/220px-Exe_estuary_from_balloon.jpg" width="220" height="164"><br><p>River Exe estuary</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Estuary_mouth.jpg/220px-Estuary_mouth.jpg" width="220" height="144"><br><p>Estuary mouth located in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Thekkumbhagam_Estuary%2C_Paravur.jpg/220px-Thekkumbhagam_Estuary%2C_Paravur.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>A crowded estuary mouth in Paravur near the city of Kollam, India</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/220px-Estuary-mouth.jpg" width="220" height="148"><br><p>Estuary mouth</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Rio_de_la_Plata_BA_2.JPG/220px-Rio_de_la_Plata_BA_2.JPG" width="220" height="146"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Río de la Plata estuary</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Yachats_River_estuary_mouth.jpg/220px-Yachats_River_estuary_mouth.jpg" width="220" height="151"><br><p>Estuary mouth of the Yachats River in Yachats, Oregon</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Mouths_of_amazon_geocover_1990.png/220px-Mouths_of_amazon_geocover_1990.png" width="220" height="145"><br><p>Amazon estuary</p><p>The word estuary is derived from the Latin word aestuarium meaning tidal inlet of the sea, which in itself is derived from the term aestus, meaning tide. There have been many definitions proposed to describe an estuary. The most widely accepted definition is: a semi-enclosed coastal body of water, which has a free connection with the open sea, and within which sea water is measurably diluted with freshwater derived from land drainage.[1] However, this definition excludes a number of coastal water bodies such as coastal lagoons and brackish seas. A more comprehensive definition of an estuary is a semi-enclosed body of water connected to the sea as far as the tidal limit or the salt intrusion limit and receiving freshwater runoff; however the freshwater inflow may not be perennial, the connection to the sea may be closed for part of the year and tidal influence may be negligible.[3] This broad definition also includes fjords, lagoons, river mouths, and tidal creeks. An estuary is a dynamic ecosystem having a connection to the open sea through which the sea water enters with the rhythm of the tides. The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams. The pattern of dilution varies between different estuaries and depends on the volume of fresh water, the tidal range, and the extent of evaporation of the water in the estuary.[2]</p><h2>Classification based on geomorphology[edit]</h2><h3>Drowned river valleys[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Ria</p><p>Drowned river valleys are also known as coastal plain estuaries. In places where the sea level is rising relative to the land, sea water progressively penetrates into river valleys and the topography of the estuary remains similar to that of a river valley. This is the most common type of estuary in temperate climates. Well-studied estuaries include the Severn Estuary in the United Kingdom and the Ems Dollard along the Dutch-German border.</p><p>The width-to-depth ratio of these estuaries is typically large, appearing wedge-shaped (in cross-section) in the inner part and broadening and deepening seaward. Water depths rarely exceed 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft). Examples of this type of estuary in the U.S. are the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Bay along the Mid-Atlantic coast, and Galveston Bay and Tampa Bay along the Gulf Coast.[5]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Lagoon-type or bar-built[edit]</h3><p>Bar-built estuaries are found in place where the deposition of sediment has kept pace with rising sea level so that the estuaries are shallow and separated from the sea by sand spits or barrier islands. They are relatively common in tropical and subtropical locations.</p><p>These estuaries are semi-isolated from ocean waters by barrier beaches (barrier islands and barrier spits). Formation of barrier beaches partially encloses the estuary, with only narrow inlets allowing contact with the ocean waters. Bar-built estuaries typically develop on gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges of continents and marginal sea coasts. They are extensive along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. in areas with active coastal deposition of sediments and where tidal ranges are less than 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft). The barrier beaches that enclose bar-built estuaries have been developed in several ways:</p><p>Barrier beaches form in shallow water and are generally parallel to the shoreline, resulting in long, narrow estuaries. The average water depth is usually less than 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft), and rarely exceeds 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft). Examples of bar-built estuaries are Barnegat Bay, New Jersey; Laguna Madre,[6] Texas; and Pamlico Sound, North Carolina.</p><h3>Fjord-type[edit]</h3><p>Fjords were formed where pleistocene glaciers deepened and widened existing river valleys so that they become U-shaped in cross sections. At their mouths there are typically rocks bars or sills of glacial deposits, which have the effects of modifying the estuarine circulation.</p><p>Fjord-type estuaries are formed in deeply eroded valleys formed by glaciers. These U-shaped estuaries typically have steep sides, rock bottoms, and underwater sills contoured by glacial movement. The estuary is shallowest at its mouth, where terminal glacial moraines or rock bars form sills that restrict water flow. In the upper reaches of the estuary, the depth can exceed 300&nbsp;m (1,000&nbsp;ft). The width-to-depth ratio is generally small. In estuaries with very shallow sills, tidal oscillations only affect the water down to the depth of the sill, and the waters deeper than that may remain stagnant for a very long time, so there is only an occasional exchange of the deep water of the estuary with the ocean. If the sill depth is deep, water circulation is less restricted, and there is a slow but steady exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean. Fjord-type estuaries can be found along the coasts of Alaska, the Puget Sound region of western Washington state, British Columbia, eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, New Zealand, and Norway.</p><h3>Tectonically produced[edit]</h3><p>These estuaries are formed by subsidence or land cut off from the ocean by land movement associated with faulting, volcanoes, and landslides. Inundation from eustatic sea level rise during the Holocene Epoch has also contributed to the formation of these estuaries. There are only a small number of tectonically produced estuaries; one example is the San Francisco Bay, which was formed by the crustal movements of the San Andreas fault system causing the inundation of the lower reaches of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.[7]</p><h2>Classification based on water circulation[edit]</h2><p>See also: Estuarine water circulation</p><h3>Salt wedge[edit]</h3><p>In this type of estuary, river output greatly exceeds marine input and tidal effects have a minor importance. Fresh water floats on top of the seawater in a layer that gradually thins as it moves seaward. The denser seawater moves landward along the bottom of the estuary, forming a wedge-shaped layer that is thinner as it approaches land. As a velocity difference develops between the two layers, shear forces generate internal waves at the interface, mixing the seawater upward with the freshwater. An example of a salt wedge estuary is the Mississippi River.[7]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Partially mixed[edit]</h3><p>As tidal forcing increases, river output becomes less than the marine input. Here, current induced turbulence causes mixing of the whole water column such that salinity varies more longitudinally rather than vertically, leading to a moderately stratified condition. Examples include the Chesapeake Bay and Narragansett Bay.[7]</p><h3>Well-mixed[edit]</h3><p>Tidal mixing forces exceed river output, resulting in a well mixed water column and the disappearance of the vertical salinity gradient. The freshwater-seawater boundary is eliminated due to the intense turbulent mixing and eddy effects. The lower reaches of Delaware Bay and the Raritan River in New Jersey are examples of vertically homogenous estuaries.[7]</p><h3>Inverse[edit]</h3><p>Inverse estuaries occur in dry climates where evaporation greatly exceeds the inflow of fresh water. A salinity maximum zone is formed, and both riverine and oceanic water flow close to the surface towards this zone.[8] This water is pushed downward and spreads along the bottom in both the seaward and landward direction.[3] An example of an inverse estuary is Spencer Gulf, South Australia.</p><h3>Intermittent[edit]</h3><p>Estuary type varies dramatically depending on freshwater input, and is capable of changing from a wholly marine embayment to any of the other estuary types.[9][10]</p><h2>Physiochemical variation[edit]</h2><p>The most important variable characteristics of estuary water are the concentration of dissolved oxygen, salinity and sediment load. There is extreme spatial variability in salinity, with a range of near zero at the tidal limit of tributary rivers to 3.4% at the estuary mouth. At any one point the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons, making it a harsh environment for organisms. Sediment often settles in intertidal mudflats which are extremely difficult to colonize. No points of attachment exist for algae, so vegetation based habitat is not established.[clarification needed] Sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species, and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem. Lastly, dissolved oxygen variation can cause problems for life forms. Nutrient-rich sediment from man-made sources can promote primary production life cycles, perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water; thus hypoxic or anoxic zones can develop.[11]</p><h2>Implications for marine life[edit]</h2><p>Estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide habitats for many fish nurseries, depending upon their locations in the world, such as salmon and sea trout.[12] Also, migratory bird populations, such as the black-tailed godwit,[13] make essential use of estuaries.</p><p>Two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation. Many species of fish and invertebrates have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Many animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially anoxic conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux.</p><p>Phytoplankton are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the tides. Their productivity is largely dependent upon the turbidity of the water. The main phytoplankton present are diatoms and dinoflagellates which are abundant in the sediment.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>It is important to remember that a primary source of food for many organisms on estuaries, including bacteria, is detritus from the settlement of the sedimentation.</p><h2>Human impact[edit]</h2><p>Of the thirty-two largest cities in the world, twenty-two are located on estuaries.[14] For example, New York City is located at the mouth of the Hudson River estuary.[15]</p><p>As ecosystems, estuaries are under threat from human activities such as pollution and overfishing. They are also threatened by sewage, coastal settlement, land clearance and much more. Estuaries are affected by events far upstream, and concentrate materials such as pollutants and sediments.[16] Land run-off and industrial, agricultural, and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into estuaries. Contaminants can be introduced which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment, such as plastics, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols and heavy metals.</p><p>Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation. They also accumulate in benthic environments, such as estuaries and bay muds: a geological record of human activities of the last century. The elemental composition of biofilm reflect areas of the estuary impacted by human activities, and over time may shift the basic composition of the ecosystem, and the reversible or irreversible changes in the abiotic and biotic parts of the systems from the bottom up.[17]</p><p>For example, Chinese and Russian industrial pollution, such as phenols and heavy metals, has devastated fish stocks in the Amur River and damaged its estuary soil.[18]</p><p>Estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land runoff discharges nutrients into estuaries. With human activities, land run-off also now includes the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans. Excess oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones.[19] This can result in reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations. Overfishing also occurs. Chesapeake Bay once had a flourishing oyster population that has been almost wiped out by overfishing. Oysters filter these pollutants, and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless. Historically the oysters filtered the estuary's entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days. Today that process takes almost a year,[20] and sediment, nutrients, and algae can cause problems in local waters.</p><h2>Examples[edit]</h2><h3>Africa[edit]</h3><h3>Asia[edit]</h3><h3>Europe[edit]</h3><h3>North America[edit]</h3><h3>Oceania[edit]</h3><h3>South America[edit]</h3><p><img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1" title="" width="1" height="1" style="border: none; position: absolute;">

									For other uses, see Alberta (disambiguation).</p><p>Alberta (/æl'b??rt?/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,067,175 as of 2016 census,[1] it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres (250,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September&nbsp;1, 1905.[5] The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015.</p><p>Alberta is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories to the north, and the U.S. state of Montana to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces. It has a predominantly humid continental climate, with stark contrasts over a year; but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than in areas further east, due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming.[6]</p><p>Alberta's capital, Edmonton, is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's crude oil, the Athabasca oil sands and other northern resource industries.[7]</p><p>About 290&nbsp;km (180&nbsp;mi) south of the capital is Calgary, the largest city in Alberta. Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two census metropolitan areas, both of which have populations exceeding one million,[8] while the province has 16 census agglomerations.[9] Tourist destinations in the province include Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper and Sylvan Lake.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848–1939),[10] the fourth daughter of Victoria, Queen of Canada, and Albert, Prince Consort. Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, Governor General of Canada (1878–83). Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour.[11][12]</p><h2>Geography[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Alberta_Topo_Labeled_90_dpi.png/170px-Alberta_Topo_Labeled_90_dpi.png" width="170" height="267"><br><p>Topographic map of Alberta


					Main article: Geography of Alberta</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Alberta, with an area of 661,848&nbsp;km2 (255,500&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), is the fourth largest province after Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.[13] To the south, the province borders on the 49th parallel north, separating it from the US state of Montana, while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories. To the east, the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.</p><p>The province extends 1,223&nbsp;km (760&nbsp;mi) north to south and 660&nbsp;km (410&nbsp;mi) east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is 3,747&nbsp;m (12,293&nbsp;ft) at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is 152&nbsp;m (499&nbsp;ft) on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast.[14]</p><p>With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate water resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire (1,436&nbsp;km2 (554&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Lesser Slave Lake (1,168&nbsp;km2 (451&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)), and Lake Athabasca (7,898 square kilometres (3,049&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi)) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1,538&nbsp;km (956&nbsp;mi) from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.[15] The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s. The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Moraine_Lake_17092005.jpg/220px-Moraine_Lake_17092005.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Moraine Lake in Banff National Park</p><p>Alberta's capital city, Edmonton, is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. Calgary is located approximately 280&nbsp;km (170&nbsp;mi) south of Edmonton and 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;mi) north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor. The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years.[16]</p><p>Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest, while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Alberta Mountain forests and Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests). The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming, with mixed farming more common in the north and centre, while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south.[17]</p><p>The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta, where the Red Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. Dinosaur Provincial Park, near Brooks, Alberta, showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Climate[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Banff_Trail_2.jpg/220px-Banff_Trail_2.jpg" width="220" height="164"><br><p>Winter scene at Banff Trail station in Calgary</p><p>Alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from -54&nbsp;°C (-65&nbsp;°F) in northern Alberta to -46&nbsp;°C (-51&nbsp;°F) in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare. In the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from 32&nbsp;°C (90&nbsp;°F) in the mountains to over 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F) in southeastern Alberta.[18]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Prairie_Alberta.jpg/220px-Prairie_Alberta.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Prairie in Alberta</p><p>Alberta extends for over 1,200&nbsp;km (750&nbsp;mi) from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) in the southwest to -24&nbsp;°C (-11&nbsp;°F) in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a rain shadow over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from 300&nbsp;mm (12&nbsp;in) in the southeast to 450&nbsp;mm (18&nbsp;in) in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach 600&nbsp;mm (24&nbsp;in) annually.[14][19] The province is the namesake of the Alberta clipper, a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of Southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.[20]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/May_2011_Wildfires_in_Alberta%2C_Canada.jpg/220px-May_2011_Wildfires_in_Alberta%2C_Canada.jpg" width="220" height="176"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Satellite image of wildfires in Alberta</p><p>In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21&nbsp;°C (70&nbsp;°F) in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around 28&nbsp;°C (82&nbsp;°F) in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/AB_koppen.svg/220px-AB_koppen.svg.png" width="220" height="440"><br><p>Köppen climate types in Alberta</p><p>Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 up to just under 2600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.[18]</p><p>In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at Pincher Creek, temperatures soared from -19 to 22&nbsp;°C (-2.2 to 72&nbsp;°F) in just one hour.[14] The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year. Calgary has a 56% chance of a white Christmas, while Edmonton has an 86% chance.[21]</p><p>Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate. The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a semi-arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the Palliser Triangle, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.</p><p>After Saskatchewan, Alberta experiences the most tornadoes in Canada with an average of 15 verified per year.[22] Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada, which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Ecology[edit]</h3><p>Flora[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/DinosaurProvincialParkHoodoo.jpg/220px-DinosaurProvincialParkHoodoo.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Hoodoos in Dinosaur Provincial Park</p><p>In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus anemone; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March, though April is the usual month for the general population.[25] Other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean and wild rose.[26] Members of the sunflower family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between July and September.[27] The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by short prairie grass,[28] which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, fleabane, and sage. Both yellow and white sweet clover can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.</p><p>The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically aspen, poplar, and willow. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. Aspen poplar, balsam poplar (or in some parts cottonwood), and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, lodgepole pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack.</p><p>Fauna[edit]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Ovis_canadensis_2.jpg/220px-Ovis_canadensis_2.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>The bighorn sheep is Alberta's provincial animal</p><p>The four climatic regions (alpine, boreal forest, parkland, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals.

Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie rattlesnake.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Mill_woods_edmonton_waterfowl.JPG/220px-Mill_woods_edmonton_waterfowl.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Water birds in Edmonton</p><p>Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, geese, swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. Eagles, hawks, owls and crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other temperate regions, is home to mosquitoes, flies, wasps, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, speckled, brown trout, and sturgeon. Bull trout, native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta.</p><p>Alberta is the only province in Canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of Norwegian rats.[29] Since the early 1950s, the Government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats were found and captured, in small pockets in southern Alberta,[30] putting Alberta's rat-free status in jeopardy. A colony of rats were subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in 2012, and again in 2014.[31][32]</p><h3>Paleontology[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Pachyrhinosaurus_skull.jpg/220px-Pachyrhinosaurus_skull.jpg" width="220" height="139"><br><p>Pachyrhinosaurus skull; large quantities of this genus are preserved in the Wapiti Formation</p><p>Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world.[33] Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even mass graves.[33] At least 38 dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province.[33] The Foremost Formation, Oldman Formation and Dinosaur Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur-bearing strata in Alberta.[33]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta.[33] The Dinosaur Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation.[33] In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Scollard Formation outcrops.[33] In the Drumheller Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies. Other formations have been recorded as well, like the Milk River and Foremost Formations.[33] However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops.[33] Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites.[33] Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the Belly River Group and St. Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Wapiti Formation.[33] The Wapiti Formation contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however.[33] The Bearpaw Formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression.[33] Dinosaurs are known from this Formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments.[33]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Alexander_Rutherford.jpg/170px-Alexander_Rutherford.jpg" width="170" height="228"><br><p>Alexander C.

					Main article: History of Alberta</p><p>Paleo-Indians arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the last ice age. They are thought to have migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Bering Strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the Rocky Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas. Others may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland.[34] Over time they differentiated into various First Nations peoples, including the Plains Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Plains Cree, who generally lived by hunting buffalo (American bison), and the more northerly tribes such as the Woodland Cree and Chipewyan who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.[14]</p><p>After the British arrival in Canada, approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the Athabasca River drainage, became part of Rupert's Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Hudson Bay. This area was granted by Charles II of England to the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of French Canadians in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond, who learned of the Methye Portage, which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the North West Company (NWC) of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the Mackenzie River—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.[35]</p><p>The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of Louisiana, sold to the United States in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the Forty-Ninth Parallel was ceded to Great Britain.[36]</p><p>Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities.[37] The amalgamated Hudson's Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed Canadian Government purchased Rupert's Land. Northern Alberta was included in the North-Western Territory until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's Northwest Territories.</p><p>The District of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of Alexander Cameron Rutherford as the first premier.</p><p>On June 21, 2013, during the 2013 Alberta floods Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.[38]</p><p>In 2016, a wildfire resulted in the largest evacuation of residents in Alberta's history, as more than 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Demographics of Alberta</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Alberta_population.svg/220px-Alberta_population.svg.png" width="220" height="150"><br><p>Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.</p><p>The 2016 census reported Alberta had a population of 4,067,175 living in 1,527,678 of its 1,654,129 total dwellings, an 11.6% change from its 2011 population of 3,645,257. With a land area of 640,330.46&nbsp;km2 (247,232.97&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it had a population density of 6.4/km2 (16.5/sq&nbsp;mi) in 2016.[1] Statistics Canada estimated the province to have a population of 4,280,127 in Q1 of 2017.[2]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years,[when?] mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces.[41]</p><p>About 81% of the population lives in urban areas and only about 19% in rural areas. The Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.[42] Many of Alberta's cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history.[when?] Alberta's population rose from 73,022 in 1901[43] to 3,290,350 according to the 2006 census.[44]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Alberta_Population_by_Mother_Tongue.PNG/220px-Alberta_Population_by_Mother_Tongue.PNG" width="220" height="239"><br><p>English is the most common mother tongue of Albertans.[45]</p><p>The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the population. The next most common mother tongues were Chinese with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).[46]</p><p>Other mother tongues include: Punjabi, with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); Tagalog, with 29,740 (0.92%); Ukrainian, with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); Polish, with 21,990 (0.68%); Arabic, with 20,495 (0.64%); Dutch, with 19,980 (0.62%); and Vietnamese, with 19,350 (0.60%).

					(Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.)[46]</p><p>Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and France, but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably Germany, Ukraine and Scandinavia.[47] According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.</p><p>As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population.</p><p>In the 2006 Canadian census, the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 English (27.2%); 679,705 German (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 Scottish (20.3%); 539,160 Irish (16.6%); 388,210 French (11.9%); 332,180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172,910 Dutch (5.3%); 170,935 Polish (5.2%); 169,355 North American Indian (5.2%); 144,585 Norwegian (4.4%); and 137,600 Chinese (4.2%).

There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta.[51] The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.[51]</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/AB_Pop._by_Religion.jpg/220px-AB_Pop._by_Religion.jpg" width="220" height="161"><br><p>As of 2011, Christians comprised approximately 60% of Alberta's population, while 32% of the province had no religious affiliation.</p><p>As of the 2011 National Household Survey, the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 24.3% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of non-religious residents among the provinces (after British Columbia) at 31.6% of the population. Of the remainder, 7.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the United Church of Canada, while 3.9% were Anglican. Lutherans made up 3.3% of the population while Baptists comprised 1.9%. [52]</p><p>The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. Members of LDS Church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province. Alberta has a population of Hutterites, a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites, and has a significant population of Seventh-day Adventists. Alberta is home to several Byzantine Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada's Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton.</p><p>Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Hindus live in Alberta. Muslims made up 3.2% of the population, Sikhs 1.5%, Buddhists 1.2%, and Hindus 1.0%. Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies. Canada's oldest mosque, the Al-Rashid Mosque, is located in Edmonton,[53] whereas Calgary is home to Canada's largest mosque, the Baitun Nur mosque.[54] Alberta is also home to a growing Jewish population of about 15,400 people who constituted 0.3% of Alberta's population.

					See also: List of Canadian provinces and territories by gross domestic product</p><p>Alberta's economy was one of the strongest in the world, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. In 2013 Alberta's per capita GDP exceeded that of the United States, Norway, or Switzerland,[63] and was the highest of any province in Canada at C$84,390. This was 56% higher than the national average of C$53,870 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces.[64][65] In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.[66] According to the 2006 census,[67] the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).</p><p>Alberta has no financial debt, with a 1.9% asset surplus over all net debt.[68]</p><p>The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).[69] It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a US level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average US metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
					<div class="content"><p>The Fraser Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada,[70] and the second freest economy amongst US states and Canadian provinces.[71] The government of Alberta has invested its earnings wisely; as of September 30, 2013, official statistics reported nearly 500 holdings.[72]</p><p>In 2014, Merchandise exports totalled US$121.4 Billion. Energy revenues totalled $111.7 Billion and Energy resource exports totalled $90.8 Billion. Farm Cash receipts from agricultural products totalled $12.9 Billion. Shipments of forest products totalled $5.4 Billion while exports were $2.7 Billion. Manufacturing sales totaled $79.4 Billion, and Alberta's ICT industries generated over $13 Billion in revenue. In total, Alberta's 2014 GDP amassed $364.5 Billion in 2007 dollars, or $414.3 Billion in 2015 dollars. In 2015, Alberta's GDP grew despite low oil prices, however it was unstable with growth rates as high 4.4% and as low as 0.2%. Should the GDP remain at an average of 2.2% for the last two quarters of 2015, Alberta's GDP should exceed $430 Billion by the end of 2015.[68][73] However, RBC Economics research predicts Alberta's real GDP growth to only average 0.6% for the last 2 quarters of 2015. This estimate predicts a real GDP growth of only 1.4% for 2015. A positive is the predicted 10.8% growth in Nominal GDP, and possibly above 11% in 2016.[74]</p><h3>Industry[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Syncrude_mildred_lake_plant.jpg/220px-Syncrude_mildred_lake_plant.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the Athabasca oil sands</p><p>Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil, synthetic crude, natural gas and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world’s second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer.[75] Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.</p><p>The Athabasca oil sands surrounding Fort McMurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6&nbsp;trillion barrels (254&nbsp;km3). Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.[76]</p><p>Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil. The oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss. By mid-2014 however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects. An example of this was the shelving of the Joslyn north project in the Athabasca region in May 2014.[77]</p><p>With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive liquid-crystal display systems.[78] With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.</p><h3>Agriculture and forestry[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Alberta_July_2011.jpg/220px-Alberta_July_2011.jpg" width="220" height="107"><br><p>Distinctive yellow canola fields</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Warner_Elevator_Row.jpg/220px-Warner_Elevator_Row.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>The Warner elevator row, the last surviving elevator row in Alberta, currently unprotected</p><p>Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of cattle,[79] and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.</p><p>Wheat and canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other grains are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.[80]</p><p>Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.[81]</p><p>Forestry plays a vital role in Alberta's economy, providing over 15,000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually.[82] Uses for harvested timber include pulpwood, hardwood, engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels. Recently, the United States has been Canada and Alberta's largest importer of hardwood and pulpwood[83][84], although continued trades issues (Canada–United_States_softwood_lumber_dispute) with the U.S.[85] have likely been a contributing factor towards Alberta's increased focus on Asian markets.[86]</p><h3>Tourism[edit]</h3><p>Main article: Tourism in Alberta</p><p>Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as West Edmonton Mall, Calgary Stampede, outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like Elk Island National Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, and the Columbia Icefield.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.[87] Alberta tourism relies heavily on Southern Ontario tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many other countries.</p><p>Alberta's Rockies include well-known tourist destinations Banff National Park and Jasper National Park. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Icefields Parkway. Banff is located 128&nbsp;km (80&nbsp;mi) west of Calgary on Highway&nbsp;1, and Jasper is located 366&nbsp;km (227&nbsp;mi) west of Edmonton on Yellowhead Highway.

About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's K-Days (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX).[89][90] Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Chilkoot Pass.</p><p>Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, Dinosaur Capital of The World, offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years.</p><p>Located in east-central Alberta is Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions, a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler, that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.</p><p>Alberta has numerous ski resorts most notably Sunshine Village, Lake Louise, Marmot Basin, Norquay and Nakiska.</p><h2>Government and politics[edit]</h2><p>Main articles: Politics of Alberta and Monarchy in Alberta

Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.</p><p>As Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Lois Mitchell. The Queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention. The lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the Queen. The government is headed by the premier. The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and draws all the members of the Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta.</p><p>The current premier is Rachel Notley, sworn in on May&nbsp;24, 2015.</p><p>The previous premier was Jim Prentice, who became the leader of the then governing Progressive Conservatives on September 6, 2014, following the resignation of Alison Redford and the interim leadership of Dave Hancock. Prentice was sworn in as the 16th Premier of Alberta on September&nbsp;15, 2014. He called an early election on May&nbsp;5, 2015 in which the opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) won a majority of the seats. Prentice immediately resigned his seat and leadership of the PC party, but remained premier until Notley was sworn in on May&nbsp;24, 2015.</p><p>Alberta's elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces. Since the 1960s, Alberta has had three main political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (Conservatives or Tories), the Liberals, and the social democratic New Democrats. The Wildrose Party, a more conservative party formed in early 2008, gained much support in 2012 election and became the official opposition, a role it still holds today. The strongly conservative Social Credit Party was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971.</p><p>For 44 years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta. They lost the 2015 election to the NDP, signalling a possible shift to the left in the province, also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of Alberta's major cities.[92] Since becoming a province in 1905, Alberta has seen only four changes of government - only five parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the United Farmers of Alberta, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015: and the currently governing Alberta New Democratic Party.</p><p>Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has not been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movement or referendum. Several groups are currently active promoting independence for Alberta in some form.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Taxation[edit]</h3><p>Government revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).[93] Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax of 5%). It is also the only Canadian province to have a flat tax for personal income taxes, which is 10% of taxable income.[94] This is likely to change with the election of an NDP government.[95]</p><p>The Alberta personal income tax system maintains a progressive character by granting residents personal tax exemptions of $17,787,[96] in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.[97] Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co-operation with the provincial government.</p><p>Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution. The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.[98] Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million.</p><p>Albertan municipalities raise a significant portion of their income through levying property taxes.[99] The value of assessed property in Alberta was approximately $727 billion in 2011.[100] Most real property is assessed according to its market value.[99] The exceptions to market value assessment are farmland, railways, machinery &amp; equipment and linear property, all of which is assessed by regulated rates.[101] Depending on the property type, property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal 'Local Assessment Review Board', 'Composite Assessment Review Board,' or the Alberta Municipal Government Board.[99][102]</p><h3>Law enforcement[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Alberta_Sheriff.jpg/220px-Alberta_Sheriff.jpg" width="220" height="162"><br><p>Alberta Sheriffs Branch vehicle, part of the disaster response to the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire</p><p>Policing in the province of Alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. In 1917, due to pressures of World War&nbsp;I, the Alberta Provincial Police was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a Great Depression era cost cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the now renamed Royal Canadian Mounted Police resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP K Division. With the advent of the Alberta Sheriffs Branch, the duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the Premier of Alberta have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it. ALERT is made up of members of the RCMP, Sheriffs Branch and various major municipal police forces in Alberta.</p><h3>Military[edit]</h3><p>Military bases in Alberta include Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Cold Lake, CFB Edmonton, CFB Suffield and CFB Wainwright. Air force units stationed at CFB Cold Lake have access to the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range.[103] CFB Edmonton is the headquarters for the 3rd Canadian Division.[104] CFB Suffield hosts British troops and is the largest training facility in Canada.[105]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Transportation[edit]</h2><h3>Road[edit]</h3><p>See also: List of Alberta provincial highways and List of airports in Alberta</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/DavidThompsonHighway.JPG/220px-DavidThompsonHighway.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Alberta Highway 11 beyond Banff National Park</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Alberta_Hwy_63_2.jpg/220px-Alberta_Hwy_63_2.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Alberta Highway 63 north of Fort McMurray</p><p>Alberta has over 181,000&nbsp;km (112,000&nbsp;mi) of highways and roads, of which nearly 41,000&nbsp;km (25,000&nbsp;mi) are paved.[106] The main north-south corridor is Highway 2, which begins south of Cardston at the Carway border crossing and is part of the CANAMEX Corridor. Highway&nbsp;4, which effectively extends Interstate 15 into Alberta and is the busiest US gateway to the province, begins at the Coutts border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. Highway&nbsp;3 joins Lethbridge to Fort Macleod and links Highway&nbsp;2 to Highway&nbsp;4. Highway&nbsp;2 travels north through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.[107]</p><p>North of Edmonton, the highway continues to Athabasca, then northwesterly along the south shore of Lesser Slave Lake into High Prairie, north to Peace River, west to Fairview and finally south to Grande Prairie, where it ends at an interchange with Highway&nbsp;43.[107] The section of Highway&nbsp;2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.[108] Highway&nbsp;2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: Highway 22, west of Highway&nbsp;2, known as Cowboy Trail, and Highway&nbsp;21, east of Highway&nbsp;2. Highway&nbsp;43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the Peace River Country; Highway 63 travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the Athabasca oil sands.[107]</p><p>Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the Trans-Canada Highway system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the Yellowhead Highway (Highway&nbsp;16), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and Jasper National Park into British Columbia.[107] One of the most scenic drives is along the Icefields Parkway, which runs for 228&nbsp;km (142&nbsp;mi) between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length. A third corridor stretches across southern Alberta; Highway&nbsp;3 runs between Crowsnest Pass and Medicine Hat through Lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the Crowsnest Highway.[107] Another major corridor through central Alberta is Highway&nbsp;11 (also known as the David Thompson Highway), which runs east from the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff National Park through Rocky Mountain House and Red Deer, connecting with Highway&nbsp;12 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) west of Stettler. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway&nbsp;2 just west of Red Deer.[107]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called trails. For example, Highway&nbsp;2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called Deerfoot Trail as it passes through Calgary but becomes Calgary Trail (for southbound traffic) and Gateway Boulevard (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of St. Albert. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent First Nations individuals and tribes, such as Crowchild Trail, Deerfoot Trail, and Stoney Trail.[109]</p><h3>Public Transit[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Calgary_LRT-3.JPG/220px-Calgary_LRT-3.JPG" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Calgary Transit C-Train</p><p>Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial public transit systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate light rail transit (LRT) systems. Edmonton LRT, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the CBD, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary C-Train has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.</p><h3>Air[edit]</h3><p>Alberta is well-connected by air, with international airports in both Calgary and Edmonton. Calgary International Airport and Edmonton International Airport are the third and fifth busiest in Canada respectively. Calgary's airport is a hub for WestJet Airlines and a regional hub for Air Canada. Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean.[110] Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.[111]</p><h3>Rail[edit]</h3><p>There are more than 9,000&nbsp;km (5,600&nbsp;mi) of operating mainline railway; the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway companies operate railway freight across the province. Passenger trains include Via Rail's Canadian (Toronto–Vancouver) or Jasper–Prince Rupert trains, which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes. The Rocky Mountaineer operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper.</p><h2>Health care[edit]</h2><p>See also: Health care in Canada</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Alberta_Children%27s_Hospital_3%2B4.jpg/220px-Alberta_Children%27s_Hospital_3%2B4.jpg" width="220" height="74"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary</p><p>Albe<br>

This is Arizona's official state flower.</p><p>Arizona (/??r?'zo?n?, ær?-/&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) (Navajo: Hoozdo Hahoodzo [xò?ztò x?`xò?tsò]; O'odham: Ali ?onak [?a?i ??onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western and the Mountain states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626&nbsp;km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.</p><p>Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.</p><p>Southern Arizona is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; some mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Alpine, and Tucson. In addition to the Grand Canyon National Park, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments.</p><p>About one-quarter of the state[8] is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Although federal law gave all Native Americans the right to vote in 1924, Arizona excluded those living on reservations from voting until its state Supreme Court ruled in 1948 in favor of Native American plaintiffs.[9][10]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology[edit]</h2><p>The state's name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, Arizonac, derived from the O'odham name ali ?onak, meaning small spring, which initially applied only to an area near the silver mining camp of Planchas de Plata, Sonora.[11][12][13][14] To the European settlers, their pronunciation sounded like Arissona.[15] The area is still known as ali ?onak in the O'odham language.[16] Another possible origin is the Basque phrase haritz ona (the good oak), as there were numerous Basque sheepherders in the area.[17][18][19]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>There is a misconception that the state's name originated from the Spanish term Árida Zona (Arid Zone).[15]</p><h2>Geography and geology[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Geography of Arizona</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/AZ_koppen.svg/220px-AZ_koppen.svg.png" width="220" height="325"><br><p>Köppen climate types of Arizona</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Grand_Canyon_Horseshoe_Bend_%28crop_2%29.jpg/220px-Grand_Canyon_Horseshoe_Bend_%28crop_2%29.jpg" width="220" height="144"><br><p>The Horseshoe Bend of the Colorado River.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Monument_Valley_01.jpg/220px-Monument_Valley_01.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>West Mitten at Monument Valley</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Blue_Mesa_Painted_Desert.jpg/220px-Blue_Mesa_Painted_Desert.jpg" width="220" height="147"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Blue Mesa at Petrified Forest National Park</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/USA_09847_Grand_Canyon_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg/220px-USA_09847_Grand_Canyon_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>The Grand Canyon.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Bellemont_Arizona_View.jpg/220px-Bellemont_Arizona_View.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>San Francisco Peaks seen from Bellemont, Arizona</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Saguaro_National_Park_-_Flickr_-_Joe_Parks.jpg/220px-Saguaro_National_Park_-_Flickr_-_Joe_Parks.jpg" width="220" height="147"><br><p>Sonoran Desert at Saguaro National Park</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Cathedral_Rock_Water-27527-1.jpg/220px-Cathedral_Rock_Water-27527-1.jpg" width="220" height="138"><br><p>Cathedral Rock near Red Rock Crossing in Sedona

Arizona is the sixth largest state by area, ranked after New Mexico and before Nevada. Of the state's 113,998 square miles (295,000&nbsp;km2), approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and park land, state trust land and Native American reservations.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Arizona is well known for its desert Basin and Range region in the state's southern portions, which is rich in a landscape of xerophyte plants such as the cactus. This region's topography was shaped by prehistoric volcanism, followed by the cooling-off and related subsidence. Its climate has exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the Colorado Plateau (see Arizona Mountains forests).</p><p>Like other states of the Southwest United States, Arizona has an abundance of mountains and plateaus. Despite the state's aridity, 27% of Arizona is forest,[20] a percentage comparable to modern-day France or Germany[citation needed]. The world's largest stand of ponderosa pine trees is in Arizona.[21]</p><p>The Mogollon Rim, a 1,998-foot (609&nbsp;m) escarpment, cuts across the state's central section and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. In 2002, this was an area of the Rodeo–Chediski Fire, the worst fire in state history.</p><p>Located in northern Arizona, the Grand Canyon is a colorful, deep, steep-sided gorge, carved by the Colorado River. The canyon is one of the seven natural wonders of the world and is largely contained in the Grand Canyon National Park—one of the first national parks in the United States. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area as a National Park, often visiting to hunt mountain lion and enjoy the scenery. The canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years, and is about 277 miles (446&nbsp;km) long, ranges in width from 4 to 18 miles (6 to 29&nbsp;km) and attains a depth of more than 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km). Nearly two billion years of the Earth's history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of sediment as the Colorado Plateau uplifted.</p><p>Arizona is home to one of the most well-preserved meteorite impact sites in the world. Created around 50,000 years ago, the Barringer Meteorite Crater (better known simply as Meteor Crater) is a gigantic hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau, about 25 miles (40&nbsp;km) west of Winslow. A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders, some of them the size of small houses, rises 150 feet (46&nbsp;m) above the level of the surrounding plain. The crater itself is nearly 1&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) wide, and 570 feet (170&nbsp;m) deep.</p><p>Arizona is one of two U.S. states that does not observe Daylight Saving Time (the other being Hawaii). The exception is within the large Navajo Nation (which observes Daylight Saving Time), in the state's northeastern region.</p><h3>Earthquakes[edit]</h3><p>Generally, Arizona is at low risk of earthquakes, except for the southwestern portion which is at moderate risk due to its proximity to Southern California. On the other hand, Northern Arizona is at moderate risk due to numerous faults in the area. The regions near and west of Phoenix have the lowest risk.[22]</p><p>The earliest Arizona earthquakes were recorded at Fort Yuma, on the California side of the Colorado River. They were centered near the Imperial Valley, or Mexico, back in the 1800s. Residents in Douglas felt the 1887 Sonora earthquake with its epicenter 40 miles to the south in the Mexican state of Sonora.[23] The first damaging earthquake known to be centered within Arizona occurred on January 25, 1906, also including a series of other earthquakes centered near Socorro, New Mexico. The shock was violent in Flagstaff.</p><p>In September 1910, a series of fifty-two earthquakes caused a construction crew near Flagstaff to leave the area. In 1912, the year Arizona achieved statehood, on August 18, an earthquake caused a 50-mile crack in the San Francisco Range. In early January 1935, the state experienced a series of earthquakes, in the Yuma area and near the Grand Canyon. Arizona experienced its largest earthquake in 1959, with a tremor of a magnitude 5.6. It was centered near Fredonia, in the state's northwest near the border with Utah. The tremor was felt across the border in Nevada and Utah.[23]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Climate[edit]</h2><p>Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. In the lower elevations, the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and extremely hot summers. Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of 60&nbsp;°F (16&nbsp;°C). November through February are the coldest months, with temperatures typically ranging from 40 to 75&nbsp;°F (4 to 24&nbsp;°C), with occasional frosts.[24]</p><p>About midway through February, the temperatures start to rise, with warm days, and cool, breezy nights. The summer months of June through September bring a dry heat from 90–120&nbsp;°F (32–49&nbsp;°C), with occasional high temperatures exceeding 125&nbsp;°F (52&nbsp;°C) having been observed in the desert area.[24] Arizona's all-time record high is 128&nbsp;°F (53&nbsp;°C) recorded at Lake Havasu City on June 29, 1994, and July 5, 2007; the all-time record low of -40&nbsp;°F (-40&amp;nbnbsp;°C) was recorded at Hawley Lake on January 7, 1971.</p><p>Due to the primarily dry climate, large diurnal temperature variations occur in less-developed areas of the desert above 2,500 feet. The swings can be as large as 83&nbsp;°F (28&nbsp;°C) in the summer months. In the state's urban centers, the effects of local warming result in much higher measured night-time lows than in the recent past.</p><p>Arizona has an average annual rainfall of 12.7&nbsp;in (323&nbsp;mm),[25] which comes during two rainy seasons, with cold fronts coming from the Pacific Ocean during the winter and a monsoon in the summer.[26] The monsoon season occurs toward the end of summer. In July or August, the dewpoint rises dramatically for a brief period. During this time, the air contains large amounts of water vapor. Dewpoints as high as 81&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C)[27] have been recorded during the Phoenix monsoon season. This hot moisture brings lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause flash floods, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the Arizona Legislature enacted the Stupid Motorist Law. It is rare for tornadoes or hurricanes to occur in Arizona.</p><p>Arizona's northern third is a plateau at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert, and has an appreciably cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers, though the climate remains semiarid to arid. Extremely cold temperatures are not unknown; cold air systems from the northern states and Canada occasionally push into the state, bringing temperatures below 0&nbsp;°F (-18&nbsp;°C) to the state's northern parts.</p><p>Indicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C) (Phoenix), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with the most days with a low temperature below freezing (Flagstaff).[28]</p><h2>History[edit]</h2><p>Main article: History of Arizona</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/North_Rim_of_Grand_Canyon%2C_Arizona_2005.jpg/220px-North_Rim_of_Grand_Canyon%2C_Arizona_2005.jpg" width="220" height="166"><br><p>The North Rim of the Grand Canyon.</p><p>For thousands of years before the modern era, Arizona was home to numerous Native American tribes.

He explored parts of the present state and made contact with native inhabitants, probably the Sobaipuri. The expedition of Spanish explorer Coronado entered the area in 1540–1542 during its search for Cíbola.</p><p>Father Kino was the next European in the region. A member of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), he led the development of a chain of missions in the region. He converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the Pimería Alta (now southern Arizona and northern Sonora) in the 1690s and early 18th century. Spain founded presidios (fortified towns) at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775.</p><p>When Mexico achieved its independence from the Kingdom of Spain and its Spanish Empire in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of its Territory of Nueva California, (New California), also known as Alta California (Upper California).[30] Descendants of ethnic Spanish and mestizo settlers from the colonial years still lived in the area, with much deeper roots than later European-American migrants from the United States.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Mexico_1824_%28equirectangular_projection%29.png/220px-Mexico_1824_%28equirectangular_projection%29.png" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Mexico in 1824. Alta California is the northwestern-most state.</p><p>During the Mexican–American War (1847-1848), the U.S. Army occupied the national capital of Mexico City and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico, including what later became Arizona Territory in 1863 and later the State of Arizona in 1912. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) specified that, in addition to language and cultural rights of the existing inhabitants of former Mexican citizens being considered as inviolable, the sum of US$15&nbsp;million dollars in compensation (equivalent to $415,211,538.46 in 2016.) be paid to the Republic of Mexico.[31] In 1853 the U.S. acquired the land south below the Gila River from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase along the southern border area as encompassing the best future southern route for a transcontinental railway. Arizona was administered as part of the larger Territory of New Mexico, established 1850, until southern New Mexico Territory seceded[32] from the Union of the United States during the American Civil War and was set up as the Confederate Territory of Arizona on March 16, 1861.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Apache_chieff_Geronimo_%28right%29_and_his_warriors_in_1886.jpg/220px-Apache_chieff_Geronimo_%28right%29_and_his_warriors_in_1886.jpg" width="220" height="134"><br><p>Geronimo (far right) and his Apache warriors fought against both Mexican and American settlers</p><p>Arizona was recognized as a Confederate Territory by presidential proclamation of Jefferson Davis on February 14, 1862, and sent a delegate to the Confederate States Congress in Richmond. This is the first official use of the name Arizona. Arizona supported the Confederate cause with men, horses, and supplies. Formed in 1862, Arizona Scout Companies fought with the Confederate States Army throughout the war. Arizona has the westernmost recorded engagement of the war, in the Battle of Picacho Pass.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Federal government declared a new U.S. Arizona Territory, consisting of the western half of earlier New Mexico Territory, in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1863. These new boundaries would later form the basis of the state. The first territorial capital, Prescott, was founded in 1864 following a gold rush to central Arizona.[33]</p><p>Although names including Gadsonia, Pimeria, Montezuma, and Arizuma had been considered for the territory,[34] when 16th President Abraham Lincoln signed the final bill, it read Arizona, and that name was adopted. (Montezuma was not derived from the Aztec emperor, but was the sacred name of a divine hero to the Pima people of the Gila River Valley. It was probably considered—and rejected—for its sentimental value before Congress settled on the name Arizona.)</p><p>Brigham Young, patriarchal leader of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City in Utah, sent Mormons to Arizona in the mid- to late 19th century. They founded Mesa, Snowflake, Heber, Safford, and other towns. They also settled in the Phoenix Valley (or Valley of the Sun), Tempe, Prescott, and other areas. The Mormons settled what became northern Arizona and northern New Mexico. At the time these areas were located in a part of the former New Mexico Territory.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/DorotheaLangeMigrantWorkersChildren.jpg/220px-DorotheaLangeMigrantWorkersChildren.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Children of Depression-era migrant workers, Pinal County, 1937</p><h3>20th century to present[edit]</h3><p>During the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920, several battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizona settlements. Throughout the revolution, numerous Arizonans enlisted in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico. Only two significant engagements took place on U.S. soil between U.S. and Mexican forces: Pancho Villa's 1916 Columbus Raid in New Mexico, and the Battle of Ambos Nogales in 1918 in Arizona. The Americans won the latter.</p><p>After U.S. soldiers were fired on by Mexican federal troops, the American garrison launched an assault into Nogales, Mexico. The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties. A few months earlier, just west of Nogales, an Indian War battle had occurred, considered the last engagement in the American Indian Wars, which lasted from 1775 to 1918. U.S. soldiers stationed on the border confronted Yaqui Indians who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements, as part of their wars against Mexico.</p><p>Arizona became a U.S. state on February 14, 1912. Arizona was the 48th state admitted to the U.S. and the last of the contiguous states to be admitted.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Eleanor_Roosevelt_at_Gila_River%2C_Arizona_at_Japanese-American_Internment_Center_-_NARA_-_197094.jpg/220px-Eleanor_Roosevelt_at_Gila_River%2C_Arizona_at_Japanese-American_Internment_Center_-_NARA_-_197094.jpg" width="220" height="172"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Eleanor Roosevelt at the Gila River relocation center, April 23, 1943</p><p>Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. But during the 1920s and even the 1930s, tourism began to develop as the important Arizonan industry it is today. Dude ranches, such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to take part in the flavor and activities of the Old West. Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws. They include the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in central Phoenix (opened 1929) and the Wigwam Resort on the west side of the Phoenix area (opened 1936).</p><p>Arizona was the site of German POW camps during World War II and Japanese-American internment camps. Because of wartime fears of Japanese invasion of the West Coast, the government authorized the removal of all Japanese-American residents from western Washington, western Oregon, all of California, and western Arizona. From 1942 to 1945, they were forced to reside in internment camps built in the interior of the country. Many lost their homes and businesses in the process. The camps were abolished after World War II.</p><p>The Phoenix-area German POW site was purchased after the war by the Maytag family (of major home appliance fame). It was developed as the site of the Phoenix Zoo. A Japanese-American internment camp was located on Mount Lemmon, just outside the state's southeastern city of Tucson. Another POW camp was located near the Gila River in eastern Yuma County.</p><p>Arizona was also home to the Phoenix Indian School, one of several federal Indian boarding schools designed to assimilate Native American children into mainstream European-American culture. Children were often enrolled into these schools against the wishes of their parents and families. Attempts to suppress native identities included forcing the children to cut their hair, to take and use English names, to speak only English, and to practice Christianity rather than their native religions.[35]</p><p>Numerous Native Americans from Arizona fought for the United States during World War II. Their experiences resulted in a rising activism in the postwar years to achieve better treatment and civil rights after their return to the state. After Maricopa County did not allow them to register to vote, in 1948 veteran Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, of the Mojave-Apache Tribe at Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, brought a legal suit, Harrison and Austin v. Laveen, to challenge this exclusion. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in their favor.[10]</p><p>Arizona's population grew tremendously with residential and business development after World War II, aided by the widespread use of air conditioning, which made the intensely hot summers more comfortable. According to the Arizona Blue Book (published by the Arizona Secretary of State's office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970, it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades, and about 60% each decade thereafter.</p><p>In the 1960s, retirement communities were developed. These were special age-restricted subdivisions catering exclusively to the needs of senior citizens; they attracted many retirees who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the Midwest and the Northeast. Sun City, established by developer Del Webb and opened in 1960, was one of the first such communities. Green Valley, south of Tucson, was another such community, designed as a retirement subdivision for Arizona's teachers. Many senior citizens from across the U.S. and Canada come to Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as snowbirds.</p><p>In March 2000, Arizona was the site of the first legally binding election ever held over the internet to nominate a candidate for public office.[36] In the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary, under worldwide attention, Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley. Voter turnout in this state primary increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Three ships named USS Arizona have been christened in honor of the state, although only USS Arizona (BB-39) was so named after statehood was achieved.</p><h2>Demographics[edit]</h2><p>Main article: Demographics of Arizona</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Arizona_population_map.png/350px-Arizona_population_map.png" width="350" height="350"><br><p>A population density map of Arizona.</p><p>The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Arizona was 6,828,065 on July 1, 2015, a 6.82% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[38]</p><p>Arizona remained sparsely settled for most of the 19th century.[39] The 1860 census reported the population of Arizona County to be 6,482, of whom 4,040 were listed as Indians, 21 as free colored, and 2,421 as white.[40][41] Arizona's continued population growth puts an enormous stress on the state's water supply.[42] As of 2011, 61.3% of Arizona's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.[43]</p><p>The population of metropolitan Phoenix increased by 45.3% from 1991 through 2001, helping to make Arizona the second fastest-growing state in the U.S. in the 1990s (the fastest was Nevada).[44] As of January 2012, the population of the Phoenix area is estimated to be over 4.3&nbsp;million.</p><p>According to the 2010 United States Census, Arizona had a population of 6,392,017.

Other prominent cities in the Phoenix metro area include Mesa (the third largest city in Arizona), Chandler (the fourth largest city in Arizona), Glendale, Peoria, Buckeye, Sun City, Sun City West, Fountain Hills, Surprise, Gilbert, El Mirage, Avondale, Tempe, Tolleson and Scottsdale, with a total metropolitan population of just over 4.3&nbsp;million.[56] It has an average July high temperature of 106&nbsp;°F (41&nbsp;°C), one of the highest of any metropolitan area in the United States, offset by an average January high temperature of 67&nbsp;°F (19&nbsp;°C), the basis of its winter appeal.</p><p>Tucson, with a metro population of just over one million, is the state's second-largest city. It is located in Pima County, approximately 110 miles (180&nbsp;km) southeast of Phoenix. Tucson was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest incorporated city in Arizona. It is home to the University of Arizona. Major incorporated suburbs of Tucson include Oro Valley and Marana northwest of the city, Sahuarita south of the city, and South Tucson in an enclave south of downtown. It has an average July temperature of 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C) and winter temperatures averaging 65&nbsp;°F (18&nbsp;°C). Saguaro National Park, just west of the city in the Tucson Mountains, is the locale of the largest collection of Saguaro cacti in the world.</p><p>The Prescott metropolitan area includes the cities of Prescott, Cottonwood, Camp Verde and numerous other towns spread out over the 8,123 square miles (21,000&nbsp;km2) of Yavapai County area. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns forms the third largest metropolitan area in the state. The city of Prescott (population 41,528) lies approximately 100 miles (160&nbsp;km) northwest of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Situated in pine tree forests at an elevation of about 5,500 feet (1,700&nbsp;m), Prescott enjoys a much cooler climate than Phoenix, with average summer highs around 88&nbsp;°F (31&nbsp;°C) and winter temperatures averaging 50&nbsp;°F (10&nbsp;°C).</p><p>Yuma is center of the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Arizona.

(The same month's average in Death Valley is 115&nbsp;°F (46&nbsp;°C).) The city features sunny days about 90% of the year. The Yuma Metropolitan Statistical Area has a population of 160,000. Yuma attracts many winter visitors from all over the United States.</p><p>Flagstaff, in Coconino County, is the largest city in northern Arizona, and is at an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet (2,100&nbsp;m). With its large Ponderosa pine forests, snowy winter weather and picturesque mountains, it is a stark contrast to the desert regions typically associated with Arizona. It is sited at the base of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona, which contain Humphreys Peak, the highest point in Arizona at 12,633 feet (3,851&nbsp;m). Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to numerous tourist attractions including: Grand Canyon National Park, Sedona, and Oak Creek Canyon. Historic U.S. Route 66 is the main east-west street in the town. The Flagstaff metropolitan area is home to 134,421 residents and the main campus of Northern Arizona University.</p><p>Lake Havasu City, in Mohave County, known as Arizona's playground, was developed on the Colorado River and is named after Lake Havasu. Lake Havasu City has a population of about 53,000 people. It is famous for huge spring break parties, sunsets and the London Bridge, relocated from London, England.

The original Capitol building, with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900), when the area was still a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.</p><p>The House of Representatives and Senate buildings were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.</p><p>The Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, named after Wesley Bolin, a governor who died in office in the 1970s. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the anchor and signal mast from the USS Arizona (one of the U.S. Navy ships sunk in Pearl Harbor) and a granite version of the Ten Commandments.</p><h3>State legislative branch[edit]</h3><p>The Arizona Legislature is bicameral (like the legislature of every other state except Nebraska) and consists of a thirty-member Senate and a 60-member House of Representatives. Each of the thirty legislative districts has one senator and two representatives. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.</p><p>Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns sine die (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can only be extended by a majority vote of members present of each house.</p><p>The current majority party is the Republican Party, which has held power in both houses since 1993.</p><p>Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is not uncommon for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.</p><p>The fiscal year 2006–07 general fund budget, approved by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, is slightly less than $10&nbsp;billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, it also includes more than $500&nbsp;million in income- and property tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and additional funding for the K–12 education system.</p><h3>State executive branch[edit]</h3><p>Arizona's executive branch is headed by a governor, who is elected to a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. Arizona is one of the few states that does not maintain a governor's mansion. During office the governors reside within their private residence, and all executive offices are housed in the executive tower at the state capitol. The current governor of Arizona is Doug Ducey (R).</p><p>Former Governor Jan Brewer assumed office after Janet Napolitano had her nomination by Barack Obama for Secretary of Homeland Security confirmed by the United States Senate.[76] Arizona has had four female governors, more than any other state.</p><p>Other elected executive officials include the Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Attorney General, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Mine Inspector and a five-member Corporation Commission. All elected officials hold a term of four years, and are limited to two consecutive terms (except the office of the State Mine Inspector, which is limited to 4 terms[77]).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Arizona is one of seven states that do not have a specified lieutenant governor. The secretary of state is the first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. The line of succession also includes the attorney general, state treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have risen to Arizona's governorship through these means.</p><h3>State judicial branch[edit]</h3><p>The Arizona Supreme Court is the highest court in Arizona. The court currently consists of one chief justice, a vice chief justice, and three associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bipartisan commission, and are re-elected after the initial two years following their appointment. Subsequent re-elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, but almost all other appellate cases go through the Arizona Court of Appeals beforehand. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court may also declare laws unconstitutional, but only while seated en banc. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza).</p><p>The Arizona Court of Appeals, further divided into two divisions, is the intermediate court in the state. Division One is based in Phoenix, consists of sixteen judges, and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state, along with the greater Phoenix area. Division Two is based in Tucson, consists of six judges, and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state, including the Tucson area. Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices.</p><p>Each county of Arizona has a superior court, the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county.</p><h3>Counties[edit]</h3><p>Arizona is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties. As of 1983 there were 15 counties in the state, ranging in size from 1,238 square miles (3,210&nbsp;km2) to 18,661 square miles (48,330&nbsp;km2).</p><h3>Federal representation[edit]</h3><p>Arizona's two United States Senators are John McCain (R), the 2008 Republican Presidential Nominee, and Jeff Flake (R).</p><p>As of the start of the 115th Congress, Arizona's representatives in the United States House of Representatives are Tom O'Halleran (D-1), Martha McSally (R-2), Raul Grijalva (D-3), Paul Gosar (R-4), Andy Biggs (R-5), David Schweikert (R-6), Ruben Gallego (D-7), Trent Franks (R-8), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-9).

During this time period, the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election, with the only exceptions being the elections of 1920, 1924 and 1928—all three of which were national Republican landslides.</p><p>In 1924 Congress had passed a law granting citizenship and suffrage to all Native Americans, some of whom had previously been excluded as members of tribes on reservations. Legal interpretations of Arizona's constitution prohibited Native Americans living on reservations from voting, classifying them as being under guardianship.[10] This interpretation was overturned as being incorrect and unconstitutional in 1948 by the Arizona Supreme Court, following a suit by World War II Indian veterans Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, both of the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation. The landmark case is Harrison and Austin v. Laveen. After the men were refused the opportunity to register in Maricopa County, they filed suit against the registrar. The National Congress of American Indians, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and the American Civil Liberties Union all filed amicus curiae (friends of the court) briefs in the case. The State Supreme Court established the rights of Native Americans to vote in the state; at the time, they comprised about 11% of the population.[10] That year, a similar provision was overturned in New Mexico when challenged by another Indian veteran in court. These were the only two states that had continued to prohibit Native Americans from voting.[9][10]</p><p>Since the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, the majority of state voters have favored Republicans in presidential elections. Arizona voted Republican in every presidential election from 1952 to 1992, with Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan winning the state by particularly large margins. During this forty-year span, it was the only state not to be carried by a Democrat at least once.</p><p>Democrat Lyndon Johnson, in 1964, lost the state by less than 5,000 votes to Arizona Senator and native Barry Goldwater. (This was the most closely contested state in what was otherwise a landslide victory for Johnson that year.) Democrat Bill Clinton ended this streak in 1996, when he won Arizona by a little over two percentage points (Clinton had previously come within less than two percent of winning Arizona's electoral votes in 1992). Since then, the majority of the state has continued to support Republican presidential candidates by solid margins.</p><p>Since the late 20th century, the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general. The fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became increasingly friendly to Republicans from the 1950s onward. During this time, many Pinto Democrats, or conservative Democrats from rural areas, became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level. While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level, Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections. Two of the last five governors have been Democrats.</p><p>On March 4, 2008, Senator John McCain effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008, becoming the first presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964.</p><p>Arizona politics are dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, Maricopa and Pima—home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.</p><p>Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there. It has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1948. This includes the 1964 run of native son Barry Goldwater; he would not have carried his home state without his 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Similarly, while McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008, aided by his 130,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.</p><p>In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically voted more Democratic. While Tucson's suburbs lean Republican, they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Arizona rejected a same-sex marriage ban in a referendum as part of the 2006 elections. Arizona was the first state in the nation to do so. Same-sex marriage was not recognized in Arizona, but this amendment would have denied any legal or financial benefits to unmarried homosexual or heterosexual couples.[80] In 2008, Arizona voters passed Proposition 102, an amendment to the state constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman. It passed by a more narrow majority than similar votes in a number of other states.[81]</p><p>In 2010, Arizona passed SB 1070, called the toughest illegal immigration legislation in the nation. A fierce debate erupted between supporters and detractors of the law.[82]</p><p>The United States Supreme Court heard arguments March 18, 2013, regarding the validity of the Arizona law, which requires individuals to show documents proving U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in national elections.[83]</p><h3>Same-sex marriage[edit]</h3><p>A November 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 44% of Arizona voters supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found that 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56.2%–43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.[84]</p><p>On October 17, 2014, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne announced that his office would no longer object to same-sex marriage, in response to a U.S. District Court Ruling on Arizona Proposition 102. On that day, each county's Clerk of the Superior Court began to issue same-sex marriage licenses, and Arizona became the 31st state to legalize same-sex marriage.</p><h2>Education[edit]</h2><h3>Elementary and secondary education[edit]</h3><p>Public schools in Arizona are separated into about 220 local school districts which operate independently, but are governed in most cases by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the Arizona State Board of Education (a division of the Arizona Department of Education) and the state Superintendent of Public Instruction (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when there is not a presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.</p><h3>Higher education[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/University_of_Arizona_mall.jpg/220px-University_of_Arizona_mall.jpg" width="220" height="100"><br><p>The University of Arizona located in Tucson.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Asubiodesign.jpg/220px-Asubiodesign.jpg" width="220" height="147"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Arizona State University located in Tempe.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Sechrist_Hall.jpg/220px-Sechrist_Hall.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff.</p><p>Arizona is served by three public universities: The University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Northern Arizona University.

The maximum gradient is along the down-valley axis represented by a hypothetical straight channel. Meanders develop, which lengthen the course of the stream, decreasing the gradient.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Rio-cauto-cuba.JPG/220px-Rio-cauto-cuba.JPG" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Meanders of the Rio Cauto at Guamo Embarcadero, Cuba.</p><p>A meander, in general, is a bend in a sinuous watercourse or river. A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a meandering course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a snaking pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.</p><p>There is not yet full consistency or standardization of scientific terminology used to describe watercourses. A variety of symbols and schemes exist. Parameters based on mathematical formulae or numerical data vary as well, depending on the database used by the theorist. Unless otherwise defined in a specific scheme ‘meandering’ and ‘sinuosity’ here are synonymous and mean any repetitious pattern of bends, or waveforms. In some schemes, ‘meandering’ applies only to rivers with exaggerated circular loops or secondary meanders; that is, meanders on meanders.</p><p>Sinuosity is one of the channel types that a stream may assume over all or part of its course. All streams are sinuous at some time in their geologic history over some part of their length. The sinuosity of a meandering stream has a tendency to approach a critical state at which the opposing forces which create and cut off meanders interact in such a way that sinuosity fluctuates around a constant mean, regardless of the original conditions. [1]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Origin of term[edit]</h2><p>The term derives from the Meander River located in present-day Turkey and known to the Ancient Greeks as ?a?a?d??? Maiandros (Latin: Maeander),[2] characterised by a very convoluted path along the lower reach. As such, even in Classical Greece (and in later Greek thought) the name of the river had become a common noun meaning anything convoluted and winding, such as decorative patterns or speech and ideas, as well as the geomorphological feature.[3] Strabo said: ‘…its course is so exceedingly winding that everything winding is called meandering.’[4]</p><p>The Meander River is located south of Izmir, east of the ancient Greek town of Miletus, now Milet, Turkey. It flows through a graben in the Menderes Massif, but has a flood plain much wider than the meander zone in its lower reach. Its modern Turkish name is the Büyük Menderes River.</p><h2>Governing physics[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Bend2.png/220px-Bend2.png" width="220" height="84"><br><p>Straight channel culminating in a single bend</p><p>When a fluid is introduced to an initially straight channel which then bends, the sidewalls induce a pressure gradient that causes the fluid to alter course and follow the bend. From here, two opposing processes occur: (1) irrotational flow and (2) secondary flow. For a river to ‘meander’, secondary flow must dominate.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Irrotational flow: From Bernoulli's equations, high pressure results in low velocity. Therefore, in the absence of secondary flow we would expect low fluid velocity at the outside bend and high fluid velocity at the inside bend. This classic fluid mechanics result is irrotational vortex flow. In the context of meandering rivers, its effects are dominated by those of secondary flow.</p><p>Secondary flow: A force balance exists between pressure forces pointing to the inside bend of the river and centrifugal forces pointing to the outside bend of the river. In the context of meandering rivers, a boundary layer exists within the thin layer of fluid that interacts with the river bed. Inside that layer and following standard boundary-layer theory, the velocity of the fluid is effectively zero. Centrifugal force, which depends on velocity, is also therefore effectively zero. Pressure force, however, remains unaffected by the boundary layer. Therefore, within the boundary layer, pressure force dominates and fluid moves along the bottom of the river from the outside bend to the inside bend. This initiates helicoidal flow: Along the river bed, fluid roughly follows the curve of the channel but is also forced toward the inside bend; away from the river bed, fluid also roughly follows the curve of the channel but is forced, to some extent, from the inside to the outside bend. Ultimately, the downstream velocity of the fluid is convectively transported to the outside bend, resulting in higher velocities at the outside bend. This secondary flow effect dominates over that of irrotational flow: In real meandering rivers, we observe higher downstream fluid velocities at the outside bends.</p><p>The higher (lower) velocities at the outside (inside) bend result in higher (lower) sheer stresses and therefore results in erosion (deposition). Thus meander bends erode at the outside bend, causing the river to becoming increasingly sinuous (until cutoff events occur). Deposition at the inside bend occur such that for most natural meandering rivers, the river width remains nearly constant, even as the river evolves.

Ideal waveforms, such as a sine wave, are one line thick, but in the case of a stream the width must be taken into consideration. The bankfull width is the distance across the bed at an average cross-section at the full-stream level, typically estimated by the line of lowest vegetation.</p><p>As a waveform the meandering stream follows the down-valley axis, a straight line fitted to the curve such that the sum of all the amplitudes measured from it is zero. This axis represents the overall direction of the stream.</p><p>At any cross-section the flow is following the sinuous axis, the centerline of the bed. Two consecutive crossing points of sinuous and down-valley axes define a meander loop. The meander is two consecutive loops pointing in opposite transverse directions. The distance of one meander along the down-valley axis is the meander length or wavelength. The maximum distance from the down-valley axis to the sinuous axis of a loop is the meander width or amplitude. The course at that point is the apex.</p><p>In contrast to sine waves, the loops of a meandering stream are more nearly circular. The curvature varies from a maximum at the apex to zero at a crossing point (straight line), also called an inflection, because the curvature changes direction in that vicinity. The radius of the loop is the straight line perpendicular to the down-valley axis intersecting the sinuous axis at the apex. As the loop is not ideal, additional information is needed to characterize it. The orientation angle is the angle between sinuous axis and down-valley axis at any point on the sinuous axis.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Great_Ouse_Relief_Channel.jpg/220px-Great_Ouse_Relief_Channel.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br><p>Concave bank and convex bank, Great Ouse Relief Channel, England.</p><p>A loop at the apex has an outer or convex bank and an inner or concave bank. The meander belt is defined by an average meander width measured from outer bank to outer bank instead of from centerline to centerline. If there is a flood plain, it extends beyond the meander belt. The meander is then said to be free—it can be found anywhere in the flood plain. If there is no flood plain, the meanders are fixed.</p><p>Various mathematical formulae relate the variables of the meander geometry. As it turns out some numerical parameters can be established, which appear in the formulae. The waveform depends ultimately on the characteristics of the flow but the parameters are independent of it and apparently are caused by geologic factors. In general the meander length is 10-14 times, with an average 11 times, the fullbank channel width and 3 to 5 times, with an average of 4.7 times, the radius of curvature at the apex. This radius is 2-3 times the channel width.</p><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Meander-Cuckmere_River-MT.JPG/220px-Meander-Cuckmere_River-MT.JPG" width="220" height="143"><br><p>Meander of the River Cuckmere in Southern England</p><p>A meander has a depth pattern as well. The cross-overs are marked by riffles, or shallow beds, while at the apices are pools. In a pool direction of flow is downward, scouring the bed material. The major volume, however, flows more slowly on the inside of the bend where, due to decreased velocity, it deposits sediment.</p><p>The line of maximum depth, or channel, is the thalweg or thalweg line. It is typically designated the borderline when rivers are used as political borders. The thalweg hugs the outer banks and returns to center over the riffles. The meander arc length is the distance along the thalweg over one meander. The river length is the length along the centerline.</p><h2>Formation[edit]</h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Meandro.png/110px-Meandro.png" width="110" height="298"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><p>Life history of a meander</p><p>Meander formation is a result of natural factors and processes. The waveform configuration of a stream is constantly changing. Fluid flows around a bend in a vortex.[7] Once a channel begins to follow a sinusoidal path, the amplitude and concavity of the loops increase dramatically due to the effect of helical flow sweeping dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend, and leaving the outside of the bend unprotected and therefore vulnerable to accelerated erosion, forming a positive feedback loop. In the words of Elizabeth A. Wood:[8]</p><p>‘…this process of making meanders seems to be a self-intensifying process…in which greater curvature results in more erosion of the bank, which results in greater curvature…’</p><p>The cross-current along the floor of the channel is part of the secondary flow and sweeps dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend.[9] The cross-current then rises to the surface near the inside and flows towards the outside, forming the helical flow. The greater the curvature of the bend, and the faster the flow, the stronger is the cross-current and the sweeping.[10]</p><p>Due to the conservation of angular momentum the speed on the inside of the bend is faster than on the outside.[11]</p><p>Since the flow velocity is diminished, so is the centrifugal pressure. However, the pressure of the super-elevated column prevails, developing an unbalanced gradient that moves water back across the bottom from the outside to the inside. The flow is supplied by a counter-flow across the surface from the inside to the outside.[12] This entire situation is very similar to the Tea leaf paradox.[13] This secondary flow carries sediment from the outside of the bend to the inside making the river more meandering.[14]</p><p>As to why streams of any size become sinuous in the first place, there are a number of theories, not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p><h3>Stochastic theory[edit]</h3><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Rio_Negro_meanders.JPG/220px-Rio_Negro_meanders.JPG" width="220" height="146"><br><p>Meander scars, oxbow lakes and abandoned meanders in the broad flood plain of the Rio Negro, Argentina. 2010 astronaut photo from ISS.</p><p>The stochastic theory can take many forms but one of the most general statements is that of Scheidegger: ‘The meander train is assumed to be the result of the stochastic fluctuations of the direction of flow due to the random presence of direction-changing obstacles in the river path.’[15] Given a flat, smooth, tilted artificial surface, rainfall runs off it in sheets, but even in that case adhesion of water to the surface and cohesion of drops produce rivulets at random. Natural surfaces are rough and erodible to different degrees. The result of all the physical factors acting at random is channels that are not straight, which then progressively become sinuous. Even channels that appear straight have a sinuous thalweg that leads eventually to a sinuous channel.</p><h3>Equilibrium theory[edit]</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
