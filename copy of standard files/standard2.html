			By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased so much that the Museum building was no longer big enough for them. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the Museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the West, North and East sides of the Museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.</p><p>All the while, the collections kept growing. Emil Torday collected in Central Africa, Aurel Stein in Central Asia, D.G. Hogarth, Leonard Woolley and T. E. Lawrence excavated at Carchemish. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist J Pierpont Morgan donated a substantial number of objects to the museum,[31] including William Greenwell's collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for £10,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir John Evans's coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son John Pierpont Morgan Junior in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth) and a country house near Malvern. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A temporary conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.[32] In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.</p><h3>Disruption and reconstruction (1925–50)</h3><p>New mezzanine floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer Sir Joseph Duveen offered funds to build a gallery for the Parthenon sculptures. Designed by the American architect John Russell Pope, it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.[f] However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids the Parthenon Sculptures along with Museum's most valued collections were dispersed to secure basements, country house, Aldwych tube station, the National Library of Wales and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.[34] Meanwhile, prior to the war, the Nazis had sent a researcher to the British Museum for several years with the aim of compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry.[35] After the war, the Museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC Mesopotamian treasure from Ur, discovered during Leonard Woolley's 1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and garnet grave goods from the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from Mildenhall, Suffolk (1946). The immediate post-war years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the Blitz. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.</p><h3>A new public face (1950–75)</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/The_Duveen_Gallery_%281980s%29.jpg/220px-The_Duveen_Gallery_%281980s%29.jpg" width="220" height="308"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			In 1953, the Museum celebrated its bicentenary. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A Friends organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the Board of Trustees changed and the Natural History Museum became fully independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of Robert Smirke's Classical and Near Eastern galleries.[36] In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.[g]</p><p>By the 1970s the Museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition Treasures of Tutankhamun in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of manuscripts and printed books from the British Museum. This left the Museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints &amp; drawings; and ethnography. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1?1/4 miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at St Pancras for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.</p><h3>The Great Court emerges (1975–2000)</h3><p>The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in Robert Smirke's 19th-century central quadrangle into the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived Museum of Mankind at 6 Burlington Gardens from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.</p><p>The Museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in modern objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as New Guinea, Madagascar, Romania, Guatemala and Indonesia and there were excavations in the Near East, Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The Weston Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered hoards which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The Museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.[38]</p><h3>The British Museum today</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/An_actress_performing_a_play._She_wears_a_laurel_wreath_and_stands_in_front_of_a_statue_of_a_woman_from_the_Mausoleum_at_Halicarnassus._Room_21%2C_The_British_Museum%2C_London.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg" width="220" height="330"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			Today the museum no longer houses collections of natural history, and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The Museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the Natural History Museum and 150 million at the British Library.</p><p>The Round Reading Room, which was designed by the architect Sydney Smirke, opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the Museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at St Pancras. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Centre.</p><p>With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the process of demolition for Lord Foster's glass-roofed Great Court could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the Sainsbury family – with the donation valued at £25 million.[39]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As part of its very large website, the museum has the largest online database of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.[40] There is also a Highlights database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).[41] In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.[42]</p><p>In 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year.[42] Popular exhibitions including Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum and Ice Age Art are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors.[43] Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game Minecraft in conjunction with members of the public.[44]</p><h2>Governance</h2><p>The British Museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the Director. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'Principal Librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the Museum), a role that was renamed 'Director and Principal Librarian' in 1898, and 'Director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).[45]</p><p>A board of 25 trustees (with the Director as their accounting officer for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the Museum, in accordance with the British Museum Act 1963 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992.[46] Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons. The board was formed on the Museum's inception to hold its collections in trust for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. Trustee appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.[47]</p><h2>Senior management</h2><p>On 29 September 2015, the Board of Trustees confirmed Hartwig Fischer as the director of the museum. He assumed his post on 4 April 2016.[48][49]</p><p>Jonathan Williams is deputy director with responsibility for the Museum’s collection and research.[50] Christopher Yates is deputy director with responsibility for strategic planning, finance, human resources, information systems, governance, legal support, fundraising, and events.[51] Joanna Mackle is deputy director with responsibility for international engagement.[52] The post of deputy director with responsibility for the Museum's fabric and infrastructure is currently vacant. The post of deputy director with responsibility for exhibitions is also vacant.[53]</p><h2>Building</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/British_museum_entrance.jpg/220px-British_museum_entrance.jpg" width="220" height="165"><p>

			The Greek Revival façade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir Robert Smirke, with 44 columns in the Ionic order 45&nbsp;ft (14&nbsp;m) high, closely based on those of the temple of Athena Polias at Priene in Asia Minor. The pediment over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir Richard Westmacott depicting The Progress of Civilisation, consisting of fifteen allegorical figures, installed in 1852.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing (The King's Library) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with Montagu House demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public.[54] The Museum is faced with Portland stone, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using Haytor granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique Haytor Granite Tramway.[55]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/BM%3B_%27MF%27_RM1_-_The_King%27s_Library%2C_Enlightenment_1_%27Discovering_the_world_in_the_18th_Century_~_View_South.jpg/220px-BM%3B_%27MF%27_RM1_-_The_King%27s_Library%2C_Enlightenment_1_%27Discovering_the_world_in_the_18th_Century_~_View_South.jpg" width="220" height="151"><p>

			In 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the Museum's architect by his brother Sydney Smirke, whose major addition was the Round Reading Room 1854–1857; at 140 feet (43&nbsp;m) in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the Pantheon in Rome being slightly wider.</p><p>The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir John Taylor.</p><p>In 1895, Parliament gave the Museum Trustees a loan of £200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum building in the five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street.[56] The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir John James Burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by King George V and Queen Mary in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/BM%3B_Archives_-_Impression_of_the_proposed_extension.jpg/220px-BM%3B_Archives_-_Impression_of_the_proposed_extension.jpg" width="220" height="84"><p>

			The Duveen Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek &amp; Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American Beaux-Arts architect John Russell Pope. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during World War II bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south west corner of the Museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.[57]</p><p>The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers Buro Happold and the architects Foster and Partners.[58] The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company,[59] with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/BM_WCEC_July_2015.JPG/220px-BM_WCEC_July_2015.JPG" width="220" height="165"><p>

			Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000&nbsp;m2 (990,000 sq. ft).[4][not in citation given][60] In addition to 21,600&nbsp;m2 (232,000 sq. ft)[61] of on-site storage space, and 9,400&nbsp;m2 (101,000 sq. ft)[61] of external storage space. Altogether the British Museum showcases on public display less than 1%[61] of its entire collection, approximately 50,000 items.[62] There are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing 2 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) of exhibition space, although the less popular ones have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space has led to the £135 million World Conservation and Exhibition Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the Museum's conservation facilities into one Conservation Centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014.[63][64]</p><p>Blythe House in West Kensington is used by the Museum for off-site storage of small and medium-sized artefacts, and Franks House in East London is used for storage and work on the Early Prehistory – Palaeolithic and Mesolithic – and some other collections.[65]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Departments</h2><h3>Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/England%3B_London_-_The_British_Museum%2C_Egypt_Egyptian_Sculpture_~_Colossal_granite_head_of_Amenhotep_III_%28Room_4%29.2.JPG/170px-England%3B_London_-_The_British_Museum%2C_Egypt_Egyptian_Sculpture_~_Colossal_granite_head_of_Amenhotep_III_%28Room_4%29.2.JPG" width="170" height="223"><p>

			The British Museum houses the world's largest[h] and most comprehensive collection of Egyptian antiquities (with over 100,000[66] pieces) outside the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in Egypt and the Sudan. Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the Nile Valley (including Nubia), from the Predynastic Neolithic period (c. 10,000 BC) through to the Coptic (Christian) times (12th century AD), a time-span over 11,000 years.</p><p>Egyptian antiquities have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects[67] from Sir Hans Sloane. After the defeat of the French forces under Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the British army and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed Rosetta Stone, were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed Henry Salt as consul in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the Musée du Louvre.</p><p>By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund under the efforts of E.A. Wallis Budge. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from Amarna, Bubastis and Deir el-Bahari. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including Flinders Petrie's Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the Oxford University Expedition to Kawa and Faras in Sudan.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Egypt_Gallery_British_Museum.jpg/250px-Egypt_Gallery_British_Museum.jpg" width="250" height="167"><p>

			Active support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including Asyut (1907), Mostagedda and Matmar (1920s), Ashmunein (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as Soba, Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.[68]</p><p>In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of Egyptian and Sudanese Prehistory.[69] These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of Southern Methodist University in Texas, and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the Sahara Desert between 1963 and 1997.

			The British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the Classical world, with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the Greek Bronze Age (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the Edict of Milan under the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were Charles Newton, John Turtle Wood, Robert Murdoch Smith and Charles Fellows.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of Magna Graecia that include Sicily and southern Italy. The Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean cultures are represented, and the Greek collection includes important sculpture from the Parthenon in Athens, as well as elements of two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos.</p><p>Beginning from the early Bronze Age, the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of Italic and Etruscan antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from Cyprus and non-Greek colonies in Lycia and Caria on Asia Minor. There is some material from the Roman Republic, but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the Roman Empire, with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).</p><p>The collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, Greek vases (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of Sir William Hamilton's and Chevalier Durand's collections), Roman glass including the famous Cameo glass Portland Vase, Roman mosaics from Carthage and Utica in North Africa that were excavated by Nathan Davis, and silver hoards from Roman Gaul (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee Richard Payne Knight), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir Robert Hamilton Lang's collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the Townley collection as well as residual sculptures from the famous Farnese collection.</p><p>Objects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the architectural monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.</p><p>Key highlights of the collections include:</p><p>Parthenon</p><p>Erechtheion</p><p>Temple of Athena Nike</p><p>Temple of Bassae</p><p>Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</p><p>Temple of Artemis in Ephesus</p><p>Knidos in Asia Minor</p><p>Xanthos in Asia Minor</p><p>Wider Collection</p><p>Prehistoric Greece and Italy (3300 BC – 8th century BC)</p><p>Etruscan (8th century BC – 1st century BC)</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Ancient Greece (8th century BC – 4th century AD)</p><p>Ancient Rome (1st century BC – 4th century AD)</p><h3>Department of the Middle East</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/BM%3B_RM7_-_ANE%2C_Nineveh_Palace_Reliefs_Southwest_Palace_of_Sennacherib_%28701-681_B.C%29_~_Full_Elevation_%2B_Viewing_South.4.JPG/220px-BM%3B_RM7_-_ANE%2C_Nineveh_Palace_Reliefs_Southwest_Palace_of_Sennacherib_%28701-681_B.C%29_~_Full_Elevation_%2B_Viewing_South.4.JPG" width="220" height="165"><p>


		Room 9 – Assyrian palace reliefs, Nineveh, 701–681 BC

			With a collection numbering some 330,000 works,[71] the British Museum possesses the world's largest and most important collection of Mesopotamian antiquities outside Iraq. The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover Mesopotamia, Persia, the Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, parts of Central Asia, Syria, the Holy Land and Phoenician settlements in the western Mediterranean from the prehistoric period and include objects from the beginning of Islam in the 7th century. A collection of immense importance, the holdings of Assyrian sculpture, Babylonian and Sumerian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster Assyrian palace reliefs from Nimrud, Nineveh and Khorsabad. Outside the Middle East, this is the best collection,[72] and unaffected by recent terrorist destruction.</p><p>The first significant addition of Mesopotamian objects was from the collection of Claudius James Rich in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of A. H. Layard at the Assyrian sites of Nimrud and Nineveh between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of Lamassu's, palace reliefs, stelae, including the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, were brought to the British Museum.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/BM%3B_RM6_-_ANE%2C_Assyrian_Sculpture_14_West_Wall_%28M_%2B_N%29_~_Assyrian_Empire_%2B_Lamassu%2C_Gates_at_Balawat%2C_Relief_Panel%27s_%26_Full_Projection.3.jpg/170px-BM%3B_RM6_-_ANE%2C_Assyrian_Sculpture_14_West_Wall_%28M_%2B_N%29_~_Assyrian_Empire_%2B_Lamassu%2C_Gates_at_Balawat%2C_Relief_Panel%27s_%26_Full_Projection.3.jpg" width="170" height="227"><p>

			Layard's work was continued by his assistant, Hormuzd Rassam and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal and Lachish reliefs. He also discovered the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal, a large collection of cuneiform tablets of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. W. K. Loftus excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of ivories in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the Museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the Cyrus Cylinder from Babylon, the bronze gates from Balawat, important objects from Sippar, and a fine collection of Urartian bronzes from Toprakkale.</p><p>In the early 20th century excavations were carried out at Carchemish, Turkey by D. G. Hogarth and Leonard Woolley, the latter assisted by T. E. Lawrence. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern Iraq after the First World War. From Tell al-Ubaid came the bronze furnishings of a Sumerian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by H. R. Hall in 1919–24. Woolley went onto to excavate Ur between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the 'Standard of Ur', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the 'Royal Game of Ur', and two bull-headed lyres. The department also has three diorite statues of the ruler Gudea from the ancient state of Lagash and a series of limestone kudurru or boundary stones from different locations across ancient Mesopotamia.</p><p>Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The Achaemenid collection was enhanced with the addition of the Oxus Treasure in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar Ernst Herzfeld and the Hungarian-British explorer Sir Aurel Stein. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of Persepolis were donated by Sir Gore Ouseley in 1825 and the 5th Earl of Aberdeen in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid silverware in the world. The later Sasanian Empire is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer.

					</p><br><h1 lang="en">Vienna</h1><p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p><p> This article is about the capital of Austria. For other uses, see Vienna (disambiguation).</p><p>Vienna (i/vi'?n?/;[8][9] German: Wien, pronounced [vi?n]&nbsp;(&nbsp;listen)) is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8&nbsp;million[1] (2.6&nbsp;million within the metropolitan area,[4] nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants.[10] Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin.[11][12] Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3&nbsp;million inhabitants.[citation needed] In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[13]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Apart from being regarded as the City of Music[14] because of its musical legacy, Vienna is also said to be The City of Dreams because it was home to the world's first psycho-analyst – Sigmund Freud.[15] The city's roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city, and then the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is well known for having played an essential role as a leading European music centre, from the great age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.[16]</p><p>Vienna is known for its high quality of life. In a 2005 study of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver, Canada and San Francisco, USA) for the world's most liveable cities. Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne, Australia.[17][18][19][20][21] For eight consecutive years (2009–2016), the human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Vienna first in its annual Quality of Living survey of hundreds of cities around the world, a title the city still held in 2016.[22][23][24][25][26][27][28] Monocle's 2015 Quality of Life Survey ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world to make a base within.[29][30][31][32][33]</p><p>The UN-Habitat has classified Vienna as being the most prosperous city in the world in 2012/2013.[34] The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets.[35][36][37] Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners.[38]</p><p>Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions.[39] It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.[40]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><p>The English name Vienna is borrowed from the homonymous Italian version of the city's name or the French Vienne. The etymology of the city's name is still subject to scholarly dispute. Some claim that the name comes from Vedunia, meaning forest stream, which subsequently produced the Old High German Uuenia (Wenia in modern writing), the New High German Wien and its dialectal variant Wean.[41]</p><p>Others believe that the name comes from the Roman settlement name of Celtic extraction Vindobona, probably meaning fair village, white settlement from the Celtic roots vindo-, meaning bright or fair&nbsp;– as in the Irish fionn and the Welsh gwyn&nbsp;–, and -bona village, settlement.[42] A variant of this Celtic name could be preserved in the Czech and Slovak names of the city (Víden and Vieden respectively) and in that of the city's district Wieden.[43]</p><p>The name of the city in Hungarian (Bécs), Serbo-Croatian (Bec) and Ottoman Turkish (Beç) has a different, probably Slavonic origin, and originally referred to an Avar fort in the area.[44] Slovene-speakers call the city Dunaj, which in other Central European Slavic languages means the Danube River, on which the city stands.</p><h2>History</h2><p> Main articles: History of Vienna and Timeline of Vienna</p><h3>Early history</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_098v99r_1.png/220px-Nuremberg_chronicles_f_098v99r_1.png" width="220" height="97"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			Evidence has been found of continuous habitation since 500 BC, when the site of Vienna on the Danube River was settled by the Celts. In 15 BC, the Romans fortified the frontier city they called Vindobona to guard the empire against Germanic tribes to the north. One of the earliest references to Vienna is from the Jewish historian, Josephus, who recounts that the king of Judea, Herod Archelaus (ca. 23 BCE – 18 CE) was banished to the city of Vienna in Gaul by Caesar.[45]</p><p>Close ties with other Celtic peoples continued through the ages. The Irish monk Saint Colman (or Koloman, Irish Colmán, derived from colm dove) is buried in Melk Abbey and Saint Fergil (Virgil the Geometer) was Bishop of Salzburg for forty years, and twelfth-century monastic settlements were founded by Irish Benedictines. Evidence of these ties is still evident in Vienna's great Schottenstift monastery, once home to many Irish monks.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Bernardo_Bellotto%2C_il_Canaletto_-_View_of_Vienna_from_the_Belvedere.jpg/220px-Bernardo_Bellotto%2C_il_Canaletto_-_View_of_Vienna_from_the_Belvedere.jpg" width="220" height="138"><p>

			In 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a 60-mile district centering on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1145, Duke Henry II Jasomirgott moved the Babenberg family residence from Klosterneuburg to Vienna. Since that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty.[46]</p><p>In 1440, Vienna became the resident city of the Habsburg dynasty. It eventually grew to become the de facto capital of the Holy Roman Empire (1483–1806) and a cultural centre for arts and science, music and fine cuisine. Hungary occupied the city between 1485–1490.</p><p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ottoman armies were stopped twice outside Vienna (see Siege of Vienna, 1529 and Battle of Vienna, 1683). A plague epidemic ravaged Vienna in 1679, killing nearly a third of its population.[47]</p><h3>Austro-Hungarian Empire and the early 20th century</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Rudolf_von_Alt-Opera_Crossroads_in_Vienna.jpg/220px-Rudolf_von_Alt-Opera_Crossroads_in_Vienna.jpg" width="220" height="152"><p>

			In 1804, during the Napoleonic Wars, Vienna became the capital of the Austrian Empire and continued to play a major role in European and world politics, including hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Vienna remained the capital of what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city was a centre of classical music, for which the title of the First Viennese School is sometimes applied.</p><p>During the latter half of the 19th century, the city developed what had previously been the bastions and glacis into the Ringstraße, a new boulevard surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after World War I, Vienna became capital of the Republic of German-Austria, and then in 1919 of the First Republic of Austria.</p><p>From the late 19th century to 1938, the city remained a centre of high culture and modernism. A world capital of music, the city played host to composers such as Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler and Richard Strauss. The city's cultural contributions in the first half of the 20th century included, among many, the Vienna Secession movement, psychoanalysis, the Second Viennese School, the architecture of Adolf Loos and the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle. In 1913, Adolf Hitler, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Tito, Sigmund Freud and Joseph Stalin all lived within a few miles of each other in central Vienna, some of them being regulars at the same coffeehouses.[48] Within Austria, Vienna was seen as a centre of socialist politics, for which it was sometimes referred to as Red Vienna. The city was a stage to the Austrian Civil War of 1934, when Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss sent the Austrian Army to shell civilian housing occupied by the socialist militia.</p><h3>Anschluss and World War II</h3><p> Main article: Anschluss</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 1938, after a triumphant entry into Austria, Austrian-born Adolf Hitler spoke to the Austrian Germans from the balcony of the Neue Burg, a part of the Hofburg at the Heldenplatz. Viennese Jews were looted and deported.[49][50] Between 1938 (after the Anschluss) and the end of the Second World War, Vienna lost its status as a capital to Berlin as Austria ceased to exist and became a part of Nazi Germany. It was not until 1955 that Austria regained full sovereignty.</p><p>On 2 April 1945, the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive against the Germans holding the city and besieged it. British and American air raids and artillery duels between the SS and Wehrmacht and the Red Army crippled infrastructure, such as tram services and water and power distribution, and destroyed or damaged thousands of public and private buildings. Vienna fell eleven days later. Austria was separated from Germany, and Vienna was restored as the republic's capital city, but the Soviet hold on the city remained until 1955.</p><h3>Four-power Vienna</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Wien_Besatzungszonen.png/300px-Wien_Besatzungszonen.png" width="300" height="153"><p>


		Occupation zones in Vienna, 1945–55



		</p><p> Further information: Allied-occupied Austria</p><p>
			After the war, Vienna was part of Soviet-occupied Eastern Austria until September 1945. As in Berlin, Vienna in September 1945 was divided into sectors by the four powers: the US, the UK, France and the Soviet Union and supervised by an Allied Commission. The four-power occupation of Vienna differed in one key respect from that of Berlin: the central area of the city, known as the first district, constituted an international zone in which the four powers alternated control on a monthly basis. The control was policed by the four powers on a de facto day-to-day basis, the famous four soldiers in a jeep method.[51] The Berlin Blockade of 1948 raised Western concerns that the Soviets might repeat the blockade in Vienna. The matter was raised in the UK House of Commons:</p><p>What plans have the Government for dealing with a similar situation in Vienna? Vienna is in exactly a similar position to Berlin. It is surrounded by a Soviet Zone of occupation and we have our sector of responsibility in Vienna the same as the Americans and the French. What plans have the Government to deal with a similar situation arising in Vienna in the near future? I hope we shall have an answer, because this is of vital importance. – Sir Anthony Nutting, Honourable Member for Melton, 30 June 1948, House of Commons, London.[52]</p><p>There was a lack of airfields in the Western sectors, and authorities drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade. Plans included the laying down of metal landing mats at Schönbrunn. The Soviets did not blockade the city. The Potsdam Agreement included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna became a hot-bed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the Cold War in Vienna took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in Austria and Vienna. Here, the Soviet forces controlled districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21 and 22 and all areas incorporated into Vienna in 1938.</p><p>They put up barbed wire fences around the perimeter of West Berlin in 1953, but not in Vienna. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the Austrian State Treaty, agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern Austria as well as their sector in Vienna. In exchange they required that Austria declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that Austria would not be a member of NATO and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between Italy and West Germany.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The atmosphere of four-power Vienna is the background for Graham Greene's screenplay for the film The Third Man (1949). Later he adapted the screenplay as a novel and published it. Occupied Vienna is also depicted in the Philip Kerr novel, A German Requiem.</p><h3>Austrian State Treaty and afterwards</h3><p>The four-power control of Vienna lasted until the Austrian State Treaty was signed in May 1955. That year, after years of reconstruction and restoration, the State Opera and the Burgtheater, both on the Ringstraße, reopened to the public. The Soviet Union signed the State Treaty only after having been provided with the political guarantee by the federal government to declare Austria's neutrality after the withdrawal of the allied troops. This law of neutrality, passed in late October 1955 (and not the State Treaty itself), ensured that modern Austria would align with neither NATO nor the Soviet bloc, and is considered one of the reasons for Austria's late entry into the European Union.</p><p>In the 1970s, Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky inaugurated the Vienna International Centre, a new area of the city created to host international institutions. Vienna has regained much of its former international stature by hosting international organizations, such as the United Nations (United Nations Industrial Development Organization, United Nations Office at Vienna and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p><h2>Demographics</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Population_of_Vienna.svg/300px-Population_of_Vienna.svg.png" width="300" height="150"><p>


		Population of Vienna 1590 to 2013



		 
		</p><p>
			Because of the industrialization and migration from other parts of the Empire, the population of Vienna increased sharply during its time as the capital of Austria-Hungary (1867–1918). In 1910, Vienna had more than two million inhabitants, and was the fourth largest city in Europe after London, Paris and Berlin.[54] Around the start of the 20th century, Vienna was the city with the second-largest Czech population in the world (after Prague).[55] After World War I, many Czechs and Hungarians returned to their ancestral countries, resulting in a decline in the Viennese population. After World War II, the Soviets used force to repatriate key workers of Czech, Slovak and Hungarian origins to return to their ethnic homelands to further the Soviet bloc economy.</p><p>Under the Nazi regime, 65,000 Jewish people were deported and murdered in concentration camps by Nazi forces; approximately 130,000 fled.[56]</p><p>By 2001, 16% of people living in Austria had nationalities other than Austrian, nearly half of whom were from former Yugoslavia;[57][58] the next most numerous nationalities in Vienna were Turks (39,000; 2.5%), Poles (13,600; 0.9%) and Germans (12,700; 0.8%).[59]</p><p>As of 2012[update], an official report from Statistics Austria showed that more than 660,000 (38.8%) of the Viennese population have full or partial migrant background, mostly from Ex-Yugoslavia, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Romania and Hungary.[1][2]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From 2005 to 2015 the city's population grew by 10.1%.[60] According to UN-Habitat, Vienna could be the fastest growing city out of 17 European metropolitan areas until 2025 with an increase of 4.65% of its population, compared to 2010.[61]</p><h2>Geography and climate</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Vienna_20021024.JPG/220px-Vienna_20021024.JPG" width="220" height="145"><p>

			Vienna is located in northeastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the Vienna Basin. The earliest settlement, at the location of today's inner city, was south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from 151 to 542&nbsp;m (495 to 1,778&nbsp;ft). The city has a total area of 414.65 square kilometres (160.1 sq mi), making it the largest city in Austria by area.</p><p>Vienna lies within a transition of oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate (hovering just below 22&nbsp;°C in July and August), and features, according to the Köppen classification, a Cfb (oceanic) -climate. The city has warm summers with average high temperatures of 24 to 33&nbsp;°C (75 to 91&nbsp;°F), with maximum exceeding 38&nbsp;°C (100&nbsp;°F) and lows of around 17&nbsp;°C (63&nbsp;nbsp;°F). Winters are relatively dry and cold with average temperatures at about freezing point. Spring and autumn are mild. Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging 550&nbsp;mm (21.7&nbsp;in) annually, with considerable local variations, the Vienna Woods region in the west being the wettest part (700 to 800&nbsp;mm (28 to 31&nbsp;in) annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part (500 to 550&nbsp;mm (20 to 22&nbsp;in) annually). Snow in the winter is not uncommon, but rare compared to Western and Southern regions in Austria.</p><h2>Districts and enlargement</h2><p> Main article: Districts of Vienna</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Vienna%2C_administrative_divisions_-_Nmbrs.svg/220px-Vienna%2C_administrative_divisions_-_Nmbrs.svg.png" width="220" height="173"><p>

			Vienna is composed of 23 districts (Bezirke). Administrative district offices in Vienna (called Magistratische Bezirksämter) serve functions similar to those in the other Austrian states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften), the officers being subject to the mayor of Vienna; with the notable exception of the police, which is under federal supervision.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>District residents in Vienna (Austrians as well as EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a District Assembly (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councillor (amtsführender Stadrat).</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Opera-Vienna-Austria-2005.jpg/220px-Opera-Vienna-Austria-2005.jpg" width="220" height="165"><p>

			The heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today's Innere Stadt, was a fortress surrounded by fields in order to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, Vienna with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages,[63] called Vorstädte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently, the walls were razed after 1857,[64] making it possible for the city centre to expand.</p><p>In their place, a broad boulevard called the Ringstraße was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the Rathaus (town hall), the Burgtheater, the University, the Parliament, the twin museums of natural history and fine art, and the Staatsoper. It is also the location of New Wing of the Hofburg, the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly Gothic Stephansdom is located at the centre of the city, on Stephansplatz. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Urania_3904-Christian_Michelides.jpg/220px-Urania_3904-Christian_Michelides.jpg" width="220" height="165"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			From 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called Linienwall at which a road toll called the Liniengeld was charged. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called Gürtel was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892[65] and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894.[66] In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district.</p><p>From 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the right bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868–1875, i.e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938 the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding Lower Austria in 1954.[65] Since then Vienna has 23 districts.</p><p>Industries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the main flow of the Danube, but is bounded by the Donaukanal (Danube canal). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube River. Across the Danube, where the Vienna International Centre is located (districts 21–22), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.</p><h2>Politics</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Reichsrat_Vienna_Okt_2007_P2.jpg/220px-Reichsrat_Vienna_Okt_2007_P2.jpg" width="220" height="222"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			In the twenty years before the First World War and until 1918, Viennese politics were shaped by the Christian Social Party, in particular long-term mayor Karl Lueger; he was able to not apply the general voting rights for men introduced by and for the parliament of imperial Austria, the Reichsrat, in 1907, thereby excluding most of the working class from taking part in decisions. For Adolf Hitler, who spent some years in Vienna, Lueger was a remarkable teacher of how to use antisemitism in politics.</p><p>Vienna is today considered the center of the Social Democratic Party. During the period of the First Republic (1918–1934), the Vienna Social Democrats undertook many social reforms. At that time, Vienna's municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as Red Vienna (Rotes Wien). In February 1934 troops of the Austrian federal government under Engelbert Dollfuss, who had closed down the first chamber of the federal parliament, the Nationalrat, in 1933, and paramilitary socialist organisations were engaged in the Austrian Civil War, which led to the ban of the Social Democratic party.</p><p>For most of the time since after the First World War, the city has been governed by the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with absolute majorities in the city parliament. Only between 1934 and 1945, when the Social Democratic Party was illegal, mayors were appointed by the austro-fascist and later by the Nazi authorities. The current mayor of Vienna is Michael Häupl of the SPÖ. As rural Austria is dominated by conservative citizens, if the Social Democrats would not maintain their nearly unbreakable hold on Vienna, the rival Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) would dominate Austrian politics.</p><p>The city has enacted many social democratic policies. The Gemeindebauten are social housing assets that are well integrated into the city architecture outside the first or inner district. The low rents enable comfortable accommodation and good access to the city amenities. Many of the projects were built after the Second World War on vacant lots that were destroyed by bombing during the war. The city took particular pride in building them to a high standard.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Since Vienna obtained federal state (Bundesland) status of its own by the federal constitution of 1920, the mayor (except 1934–1945) also holds the function of the state governor (Landeshauptmann). The Rathaus accommodates the offices of the mayor (Magistrat der Stadt Wien) and the state government (Landesregierung). The city is administered by a multitude of departments (Magistratsabteilungen), politically supervised by amtsführende Stadträte (members of the city government leading offices; according to the Vienna constitution opposition parties have the right to designate members of the city government not leading offices).</p><p>In the 1996 City Council election, the SPÖ lost its overall majority in the 100-seat chamber, winning 43 seats and 39.15% of the vote. In 1996 the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), which won 29 seats (up from 21 in 1991), beat the ÖVP into third place for the second time running. From 1996–2001, the SPÖ governed Vienna in a coalition with the ÖVP. In 2001 the SPÖ regained the overall majority with 52 seats and 46.91% of the vote; in October 2005 this majority was increased further to 55 seats (49.09%). In course of the 2010 city council elections the SPÖ lost their overall majority again and consequently forged a coalition with the Green Party – the first SPÖ/Green coalition in Austria.[67]</p><h2>Economy</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg/220px-13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg" width="220" height="146"><p>

			A number of museums are located in the Museumsquartier (museum quarter), the former Imperial Stalls which were converted into a museum complex in the 1990s. It houses the Museum of Modern Art, commonly known as the MUMOK (Ludwig Foundation), the Leopold Museum (featuring the largest collection of paintings in the world by Egon Schiele, as well as works by the Vienna Secession, Viennese Modernism and Austrian Expressionism), the AzW (museum of architecture), additional halls with feature exhibitions, and the Tanzquartier. The Liechtenstein Palace contains much of one of the world's largest private art collections, especially strong in the Baroque. Castle Belvedere, built under Prinz Eugen, has a gallery containing paintings by Gustav Klimt (The Kiss), Egon Schiele, and other painters of the early 20th century, also sculptures by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, and changing exhibitions too.</p><p>There are a multitude of other museums in Vienna, including the Albertina, the Military History Museum, the Technical Museum, the Burial Museum, the Museum of Art Fakes, the KunstHausWien, Museum of Applied Arts, the Sigmund Freud Museum, and the Mozarthaus Vienna. The museums on the history of the city, including the former Historical Museum of the City of Vienna on Karlsplatz, the Hermesvilla, the residences and birthplaces of various composers, the Museum of the Romans, and the Vienna Clock Museum, are now gathered together under the group umbrella Vienna Museum. In addition there are museums dedicated to Vienna's individual districts. They provide a record of individual struggles, achievements and tragedy as the city grew and survived two world wars.

			A variety of architectural styles can be found in Vienna, such as the Romanesque Ruprechtskirche and the Baroque Karlskirche. Styles range from classicist buildings to modern architecture. Art Nouveau left many architectural traces in Vienna. The Secession, Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station, and the Kirche am Steinhof by Otto Wagner rank among the best known examples of Art Nouveau in the world. Wagner's prominent student Jože Plecnik from Slovenia also left important traces in Vienna. His works include the Langer House (1900) and the Zacherlhaus (1903–1905). Plecnik's 1910–1913 Church of the Holy Spirit (Heilig-Geist-Kirche&nbsp;(de)) in Vienna is remarkable for its innovative use of poured-in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church's crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases.</p><p>Concurrent to the Art Nouveau movement was the Wiener Moderne, during which some architects shunned the use of extraneous adornment. A key architect of this period was Adolf Loos, whose works include the Looshaus (1909), the Kärntner Bar or American Bar (1908) and the Steiner House (1910).</p><p>The Hundertwasserhaus by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, designed to counter the clinical look of modern architecture, is one of Vienna's most popular tourist attractions. Another example of unique architecture is the Wotrubakirche by sculptor Fritz Wotruba. In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around Donaustadt (north of the Danube) and Wienerberg (in southern Vienna).</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Stephansdom_Vienna_July_2008_%2827%29-Stephansdom_Vienna_July_2008_%2831%29.jpg/220px-Stephansdom_Vienna_July_2008_%2827%29-Stephansdom_Vienna_July_2008_%2831%29.jpg" width="220" height="158"><p>

			The 220-meter high DC Tower 1 located on the Northern bank of the Danube, completed in 2013, is the tallest skyscraper in Vienna.[109][110] In recent years, Vienna has seen numerous architecture projects completed which combine modern architectural elements with old buildings, such as the remodelling and revitalisation of the old Gasometer in 2001. Most buildings in Vienna are relatively low; in early 2006 there were around 100 buildings higher than 40 metres (130 feet). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation aimed at preserving green areas and districts designated as world cultural heritage. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings. Consequently, much of the inner city is a high-rise free zone.</p><h3>Vienna balls</h3><p>Vienna is the last great capital of the 19th-century ball. There are over 450 balls per year, some featuring as many as nine live orchestras.[111] Balls are held in the many beautiful palaces in Vienna, with the principal venue being the Hofburg Palace in Heldenplatz. While the Opera Ball is the best known internationally of all the Austrian balls, other balls such as the Kaffeesiederball (Cafe Owners Ball), the Jägerball (Hunter's Ball) and the Life Ball (AIDS charity event) are almost as well known within Austria and even better appreciated for their cordial atmosphere. Viennese of at least middle class may visit a number of balls in their lifetime.[clarification needed]</p><p>Dancers and opera singers from the Vienna State Opera often perform at the openings of the larger balls.</p><p>A Vienna ball is an all-night cultural attraction. Major Viennese balls generally begin at 9&nbsp;pm and last until 5&nbsp;am, although many guests carry on the celebrations into the next day. The Viennese balls are being exported with the support of the City of Vienna in around 30 cities worldwide such as New York, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Rome, Prague, Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow.[111][112][113]</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Vienna is Austria's main centre of education and home to many universities, professional colleges and gymnasiums (high schools).</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Friedrich_von_Schiller.JPG/220px-Friedrich_von_Schiller.JPG" width="220" height="147"><p>

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies.[1] Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.[2][3][4]</p><p>The causes of the French Revolution are complex and are still debated among historians. Following the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War,[5] the French government was deeply in debt and attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes. Years of bad harvests leading up to the Revolution also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and the aristocracy. Demands for change were formulated in terms of Enlightenment ideals and contributed to the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate taking control, the assault on the Bastille in July, the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August, and a women's march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. A central event of the first stage, in August 1789, was the abolition of feudalism and the old rules and privileges left over from the Ancien Régime. The next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. The Republic was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French victory at Valmy. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation, Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.</p><p>External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine – achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 until 1794, established price controls on food and other items, abolished slavery in French colonies abroad, dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures, and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror, with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000.[6] After the Thermidorian Reaction, an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795. The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections, debt repudiations, financial instability, persecutions against the Catholic clergy, and significant military conquests abroad.[7] Dogged by charges of corruption, the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The modern era has unfolded in the shadow of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements looked back to the Revolution as their predecessor.[8] Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as La Marseillaise and Liberté, égalité, fraternité, became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the Russian Revolution over a century later.[9]</p><p>The values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. The Revolution resulted in the suppression of the feudal system, the emancipation of the individual, the greater division of landed property, the abolition of the privileges of noble birth and the establishment of equality. The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.[10]</p><p>Globally, the Revolution accelerated the rise of republics and democracies. It became the focal point for the development of all modern political ideologies, leading to the spread of liberalism, radicalism, nationalism, socialism, feminism, and secularism, among many others. The Revolution also witnessed the birth of total war by organising the resources of France and the lives of its citizens towards the objective of military conquest.[11] Some of its central documents, like the Declaration of the Rights of Man, expanded the arena of human rights to include women and slaves, leading to movements for abolitionism and universal suffrage in the next century.[12]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Causes</h2><p> Main article: Causes of the French Revolution</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Antoine-Fran%C3%A7ois_Callet_-_Louis_XVI%2C_roi_de_France_et_de_Navarre_%281754-1793%29%2C_rev%C3%AAtu_du_grand_costume_royal_en_1779_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Antoine-Fran%C3%A7ois_Callet_-_Louis_XVI%2C_roi_de_France_et_de_Navarre_%281754-1793%29%2C_rev%C3%AAtu_du_grand_costume_royal_en_1779_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="310"><p>


		The French government faced fiscal crises in the 1780s, and King Louis XVI was blamed for mishandling these affairs.


		</p><p>
			Historians have pointed to many events and factors within the Ancien Régime that led to the Revolution. Rising social and economic inequality,[13][14] new political ideas emerging from the Enlightenment,[15] economic mismanagement, environmental factors leading to agricultural failure, unmanageable national debt,[16] and political mismanagement on the part of King Louis XVI have all been cited as laying the groundwork for the Revolution.[17][18][19][20]</p><p>Over the course of the 18th century, there emerged what the philosopher Jürgen Habermas called the idea of the public sphere in France and elsewhere in Europe.[21] Habermas argued that the dominant cultural model in 17th century France was a representational culture, which was based on a one-sided need to represent power with one side active and the other passive.[21] A perfect example would be the Palace of Versailles which was meant to overwhelm the senses of the visitor and convince one of the greatness of the French state and Louis XIV.[21] Starting in the early 18th century saw the appearance of the public sphere which was critical in that both sides were active.[22] Examples of the public sphere included newspapers, journals, masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs where people either in person or virtually via the printed word debated and discussed issues.[23] In France, the emergence of the public sphere outside of the control of the state saw the shift from Versailles to Paris as the cultural capital of France.[23] Likewise, in the 17th century it was the court that decided what was culturally good and what was not; in the 18th century, the opinion of the court mattered less and it was the consumers who became the arbiters of cultural taste.[24] In the 1750s, during the Querelle des Bouffons over the question of the quality of Italian vs. French music, the partisans of both sides appealed to the French public because it alone has the right to decide whether a work will be preserved for posterity or will be used by grocers as wrapping-paper.[25] In 1782, Louis-Sébastien Mercier wrote: The word court no longer inspires awe amongst us as in the time of Louis XIV. Reigning opinions are no longer received from the court; it no longer decides on reputations of any sort ... The court's judgments are countermanded; one says openly that it understands nothing; it has no ideas on the subject and could have none.[26] Inevitably, the belief that public opinion had the right to decide cultural questions instead of deferring to the court transformed itself into the demand that the public also have a say on political questions as well.[27]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The economy in the Ancien Régime during the years preceding the Revolution suffered from instability; poor harvests lasting several years and an inadequate transportation system both contributed to making food more expensive.[28][29] The sequence of events leading to the Revolution included the national government's fiscal troubles caused by an inefficient tax system and expenditure on numerous large wars.[16] The attempt to challenge British naval and commercial power in the Seven Years' War was a costly disaster, with the loss of France's colonial possessions in continental North America and the destruction of the French Navy.[30] French forces were rebuilt and performed more successfully in the American Revolutionary War, but only at massive additional cost, and with no real gains for France except the knowledge that Britain had been humbled.[citation needed] France's inefficient and antiquated financial system could not finance this debt.[31] Faced with a financial crisis, the king called an Estates General, recommended by the Assembly of Notables in 1787 for the first time in over a century.[32]</p><p>Meanwhile, the royal court at Versailles was isolated from and indifferent to the escalating crisis. While in theory King Louis XVI was an absolute monarch, in practice he was often indecisive and known to back down when faced with strong opposition. While he did reduce government expenditures, opponents in the parliaments successfully thwarted his attempts at enacting much needed reforms. The Enlightenment had produced many writers, pamphleteers and publishers who could inform or inflame public opinion. The opposition used this resource to mobilise public opinion against the monarchy, which in turn tried to repress the underground literature.[31]</p><p>Many other factors involved resentments and aspirations given focus by the rise of Enlightenment ideals. These included resentment of royal absolutism; resentment by peasants, labourers and the bourgeoisie towards the traditional seigneurial privileges possessed by the nobility; resentment of the Catholic Church's influence over public policy and institutions; aspirations for freedom of religion; resentment of aristocratic bishops by the poorer rural clergy; aspirations for social, political and economic equality, and (especially as the Revolution progressed) republicanism; hatred of Queen Marie-Antoinette, who was falsely accused of being a spendthrift and an Austrian spy; and anger towards the King for dismissing ministers, including finance minister Jacques Necker, who were popularly seen as representatives of the people.[33]</p><p>Freemasonry played an important role in the revolution. Originally largely apolitical, Freemasonry was radicalised in the late 18th century through the introduction of higher grades which emphasised themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Virtually every major player in the Revolution was a Freemason and these themes became the widely recognised slogan of the revolution.[34]</p><h2>Ancien Régime</h2><h3>Financial crisis</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Troisordres.jpg/220px-Troisordres.jpg" width="220" height="272"><p>

			Louis XVI ascended to the throne in the middle of a financial crisis in which the state was faced with a budget deficit and was nearing bankruptcy.[35] This was due in part to France's costly involvements in the Seven Years' War and later the American Revolution.[36] In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, Jacques Necker, a foreigner, was appointed Comptroller-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.[37]</p><p>Necker realised that the country's extremely regressive tax system subjected the lower classes to a heavy burden,[37] while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy.[38] He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36&nbsp;million livres, and proposed restricting the power of the parlements.[37]</p><p>This was not received well by the King's ministers, and Necker, hoping to bolster his position, argued to be made a minister. The King refused, Necker was dismissed, and Charles Alexandre de Calonne was appointed to the Comptrollership.[37] Calonne initially spent liberally, but he quickly realised the critical financial situation and proposed a new tax code.[39]</p><p>The proposal included a consistent land tax, which would include taxation of the nobility and clergy. Faced with opposition from the parlements, Calonne organised the summoning of the Assembly of Notables. But the Assembly failed to endorse Calonne's proposals and instead weakened his position through its criticism. In response, the King announced the calling of the Estates-General for May 1789, the first time the body had been summoned since 1614. This was a signal that the Bourbon monarchy was in a weakened state and subject to the demands of its people.[40]</p><h3>Estates-General of 1789</h3><p> Main article: Estates General of 1789 in France</p><p>The Estates-General was organised into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the rest of France. It had last met in 1614. Elections were held in the spring of 1789; suffrage requirements for the Third Estate were for French-born or naturalised males, aged 25 years or more, who resided where the vote was to take place and who paid taxes. Strong turnout produced 1,201 delegates, including 303 clergy, 291 nobles and 610 members of the Third Estate. The First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10% of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) on peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.[41] The Second Estate represented the nobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of these deputies were nobles, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 610 men, representing 95% of the population. Half were well educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.[42][43]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Estatesgeneral.jpg/220px-Estatesgeneral.jpg" width="220" height="138"><p>


		The meeting of the Estates General on 5 May 1789 at Versailles.


		</p><p>
			To assist delegates, Books of grievances (cahiers de doléances) were compiled to list problems.[44] The books articulated ideas which would have seemed radical only months before; however, most supported the monarchical system in general. Many assumed the Estates-General would approve future taxes, and Enlightenment ideals were relatively rare.[45][46]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Pamphlets by liberal nobles and clergy became widespread after the lifting of press censorship.[47] The Abbé Sieyès, a theorist and Catholic clergyman, argued the paramount importance of the Third Estate in the pamphlet Qu'est-ce que le tiers état? (What is the Third Estate?) published in January, 1789. He asserted: What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until now in the political order? Nothing. What does it want to be? Something.[45][48]</p><p>The Estates-General convened in the Grands Salles des Menus-Plaisirs in Versailles on 5 May 1789 and opened with a three-hour speech by Necker. The Third Estate demanded that the credentials of deputies should be verified by all deputies, rather than each estate verifying the credentials of its own members, but negotiations with the other estates failed to achieve this.[46][49] The commoners appealed to the clergy, who asked for more time. Necker then stated that each estate should verify its own members' credentials and that the king should act as arbitrator.[50]</p><h3>National Assembly (1789)</h3><p> Main article: National Assembly (French Revolution)</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg/220px-Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg" width="220" height="143"><p>


		The National Assembly taking the Tennis Court Oath (sketch by Jacques-Louis David).


		</p><p>
			On 10 June 1789 Abbé Sieyès moved that the Third Estate, now meeting as the Communes (English: Commons) proceed with verifying its own powers and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them. They proceeded to do so two days later, completing the process on 17 June.[51] Then they voted a measure far more radical, declaring themselves the National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of the People. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them.[52]</p><p>In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met, making an excuse that the carpenters needed to prepare the hall for a royal speech in two days. Weather did not allow an outdoor meeting, so the Assembly moved their deliberations to a nearby indoor real tennis court, where they proceeded to swear the Tennis Court Oath (20 June 1789) under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution.[53] A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them, as did 47 members of the nobility. By 27 June, the royal party had overtly given in, although the military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles.

		The Storming of the Bastille in July 1789 is widely regarded as the most iconic event of the Revolution.


		</p><p>
			Many Parisians presumed Louis' actions to be aimed against the Assembly and began open rebellion when they heard the news the next day. They were also afraid that arriving soldiers – mostly foreign mercenaries – had been summoned to shut down the National Constituent Assembly. The Assembly, meeting at Versailles, went into nonstop session to prevent another eviction from their meeting place. Paris was soon consumed by riots, chaos, and widespread looting. The mobs soon had the support of some of the French Guard, who were armed and trained soldiers.[55]</p><p>On 14 July, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress, which was also perceived to be a symbol of royal power. After several hours of combat, the prison fell that afternoon. Despite ordering a ceasefire, which prevented a mutual massacre, Governor Marquis Bernard-René de Launay was beaten, stabbed and decapitated; his head was placed on a pike and paraded about the city. Although the fortress had held only seven prisoners (four forgers, two noblemen kept for immoral behaviour, and a murder suspect) the Bastille served as a potent symbol of everything hated under the Ancien Régime. Returning to the Hôtel de Ville (city hall), the mob accused the prévôt des marchands (roughly, mayor) Jacques de Flesselles of treachery and butchered him.[56]</p><p>The King, alarmed by the violence, backed down, at least for the time being. The Marquis de Lafayette took up command of the National Guard at Paris. Jean-Sylvain Bailly, president of the Assembly at the time of the Tennis Court Oath, became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the commune. The King visited Paris, where, on 17 July he accepted a tricolore cockade, to cries of Vive la Nation (Long live the Nation) and Vive le Roi (Long live the King).[57]</p><p>Necker was recalled to power, but his triumph was short-lived. An astute financier but a less astute politician, Necker overplayed his hand by demanding and obtaining a general amnesty, losing much of the people's favour.</p><p>As civil authority rapidly deteriorated, with random acts of violence and theft breaking out across the country, members of the nobility, fearing for their safety, fled to neighbouring countries; many of these émigrés, as they were called, funded counter-revolutionary causes within France and urged foreign monarchs to offer military support to a counter-revolution.[58]</p><p>By late July, the spirit of popular sovereignty had spread throughout France. In rural areas, many commoners began to form militias and arm themselves against a foreign invasion: some attacked the châteaux of the nobility as part of a general agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur (the Great Fear). In addition, wild rumours and paranoia caused widespread unrest and civil disturbances that contributed to the collapse of law and order.[59]</p><p> Main article: Abolition of feudalism in France</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg/220px-Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen_in_1789.jpg" width="220" height="289"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 26 August 1789


		</p><p>
			On 4 and 11 August 1789 the National Constituent Assembly abolished privileges and feudalism (numerous peasant revolts had almost brought feudalism to an end) in the August Decrees, sweeping away personal serfdom,[60] exclusive hunting rights and other seigneurial rights of the Second Estate (nobility).</p><p>Also the tithe (a 10% tax for the Church, gathered by the First Estate (clergy)) was abolished which had been the main source of income for many clergymen.[61] During the course of a few hours nobles, clergy, towns, provinces, companies and cities lost their special privileges.[62]</p><p>Historian Georges Lefebvre summarises the night's work:</p><p>Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude—which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office,[63] conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices ... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.[64]</p><p>Originally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a fourth of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners.[65] The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.[66]</p><p>Furet emphasises that the decisions of August 1789 survived and became an integral part of</p><p>the founding texts of modern France. They destroyed aristocratic society from top to bottom, along with its structure of dependencies and privileges. For this structure they substituted the modern, autonomous individual, free to do whatever was not prohibited by law ... The Revolution thus distinguished itself quite early by its radical individualism [67]</p><p>The old judicial system, based on the 13 regional parlements, was suspended in November 1789, and officially abolished in September 1790. The main institutional pillars of the old regime had vanished overnight.[68]</p><p> Main article: Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</p><p>On 26 August 1789 the Assembly published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which comprised a statement of principles rather than a constitution with legal effect.

The bulk of the nobles argued for an aristocratic upper house elected by the nobles. The popular party carried the day: France would have a single, unicameral assembly. The King retained only a suspensive veto; he could delay the implementation of a law, but not block it absolutely. The Assembly eventually replaced the historic provinces with 83 départements, uniformly administered and roughly equal in area and population.[68]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Amid the Assembly's preoccupation with constitutional affairs, the financial crisis had continued largely unaddressed, and the deficit had only increased.

		</p><p>
			Fuelled by rumours of a reception for the King's bodyguards on 1 October 1789, at which the national cockade had been trampled upon, on 5 October 1789, crowds of women began to assemble at Parisian markets. The women first marched to the Hôtel de Ville, demanding that city officials address their concerns.[70] The women were responding to the harsh economic situations they faced, especially bread shortages. They also demanded an end to royal efforts to block the National Assembly, and for the King and his administration to move to Paris as a sign of good faith in addressing the widespread poverty.</p><p>Getting unsatisfactory responses from city officials, as many as 7,000 women joined the march to Versailles, bringing with them cannons and a variety of smaller weapons. Twenty thousand National Guardsmen under the command of Lafayette responded to keep order, and members of the mob stormed the palace, killing several guards.[71] Lafayette ultimately persuaded the king to accede to the demand of the crowd that the monarchy relocate to Paris.</p><p>On 6 October 1789, the King and the royal family moved from Versailles to Paris under the protection of the National Guards, thus legitimising the National Assembly.</p><p> Main articles: Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution and Civil Constitution of the Clergy</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Decret_de_l%27Assembl%C3%A9e_National_qui_supprime_les_Ordres_Religieux_et_Religieuses.jpg/220px-Decret_de_l%27Assembl%C3%A9e_National_qui_supprime_les_Ordres_Religieux_et_Religieuses.jpg" width="220" height="161"><p>

			The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Roman Catholic Church to the state.[72] Under the Ancien Régime, the Church had been the largest single landowner in the country, owning about 10% of the land in the kingdom.[73] The Church was exempt from paying taxes to the government, while it levied a tithe—a 10% tax on income, often collected in the form of crops—on the general population, only a fraction of which it then redistributed to the poor.[73]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Resentment towards the Church weakened its power during the opening of the Estates General in May 1789. The Church composed the First Estate with 130,000 members of the clergy. When the National Assembly was later created in June 1789 by the Third Estate, the clergy voted to join them, which perpetuated the destruction of the Estates General as a governing body.[74] The National Assembly began to enact social and economic reform. Legislation sanctioned on 4 August 1789 abolished the Church's authority to impose the tithe. In an attempt to address the financial crisis, the Assembly declared, on 2 November 1789, that the property of the Church was at the disposal of the nation.[75] They used this property to back a new currency, the assignats. Thus, the nation had now also taken on the responsibility of the Church, which included paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned.[76] In December, the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder to raise revenue, effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25% in two years.[77] In autumn 1789, legislation abolished monastic vows and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved.[78] Monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life and a small percentage did eventually marry.[79]</p><p>The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, passed on 12 July 1790, turned the remaining clergy into employees of the state. This established an election system for parish priests and bishops and set a pay rate for the clergy. Many Catholics objected to the election system because it effectively denied the authority of the Pope in Rome over the French Church. In October a group of 30 bishops wrote a declaration saying they could not accept that law, and this protest fueled also civilian opposition against that law.[61] Eventually, in November 1790, the National Assembly began to require an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution from all the members of the clergy.[79] This led to a schism between those clergy who swore the required oath and accepted the new arrangement and those who remained loyal to the Pope. Priests swearing the oath were indicated as 'constitutional', those not taking the oath as 'non-juring' or 'refractory' clergy.[80] Overall, 24% of the clergy nationwide took the oath.[81] This decree stiffened the resistance against the state’s interference with the church, especially in the west of France like in Normandy, Brittany and the Vendée, where only few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution.[61]</p><p>Widespread refusal led to legislation against the clergy, forcing them into exile, deporting them forcibly, or executing them as traitors.[77] Pope Pius VI never accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, further isolating the Church in France.</p><p>A new Republican Calendar was established in 1793, with 10-day weeks that made it very difficult for Catholics to remember Sundays and saints' days. Workers complained it reduced the number of first-day-of-the-week holidays from 52 to 37.[82]</p><p>During the Reign of Terror, extreme efforts of de-Christianisation ensued, including the imprisonment and massacre of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether, with civic festivals replacing religious ones. The establishment of the Cult of Reason was the final step of radical de-Christianisation. These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter-rebellions across France. Locals often resisted de-Christianisation by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted. Eventually, Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety were forced to denounce the campaign,[83] replacing the Cult of Reason with the deist but still non-Christian Cult of the Supreme Being. The Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and the Church ended the de-Christianisation period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the Third Republic via the separation of church and state on 11 December 1905. The persecution of the Church led to a counter-revolution known as the Revolt in the Vendée.[84]</p><p>Historians Lynn Hunt and Jack Censer argue that some French Protestants, the Huguenots, wanted an anti-Catholic regime, and that Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire helped fuel this resentment.[85] Historian John McManners writes, In eighteenth-century France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.[86]</p><p>Factions within the Assembly began to clarify. The aristocrat Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès and the abbé Jean-Sifrein Maury led what would become known as the right wing, the opposition to revolution (this party sat on the right-hand side of the Assembly). The Royalist democrats or monarchiens, allied with Necker, inclined towards organising France along lines similar to the British constitutional model; they included Jean Joseph Mounier, the Comte de Lally-Tollendal, the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre, and Pierre Victor Malouet, comte de Virieu.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The National Party, representing the centre or centre-left of the assembly, included Honoré Mirabeau, Lafayette, and Bailly; while Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre Lameth represented somewhat more extreme views. Almost alone in his radicalism on the left was the Arras lawyer Maximilien Robespierre. Abbé Sieyès led in proposing legislation in this period and successfully forged consensus for some time between the political centre and the left. In Paris, various committees, the mayor, the assembly of representatives, and the individual districts each claimed authority independent of the others. The increasingly middle-class National Guard under Lafayette also slowly emerged as a power in its own right, as did other self-generated assemblies.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Federation.jpg/220px-Federation.jpg" width="220" height="136"><p>


		The Fête de la Fédération on 14 July 1790 celebrated the establishment of the constitutional monarchy


		</p><p>
			The Assembly abolished the symbolic paraphernalia of the Ancien Régime – armorial bearings, liveries, etc. – which further alienated the more conservative nobles, and added to the ranks of the émigrés. On 14 July 1790, and for several days following, crowds in the Champ de Mars celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille with the Fête de la Fédération; Talleyrand performed a mass; participants swore an oath of fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king; the King and the royal family actively participated.[87]</p><p>The electors had originally chosen the members of the Estates-General to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of the Tennis Court Oath, the communes had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution. Right-wing elements now argued for a new election, but Mirabeau prevailed, asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no new election should take place before completing the constitution.[88]</p><p>In late 1790 the French army was in considerable disarray. The military officer corps was largely composed of noblemen, who found it increasingly difficult to maintain order within the ranks. In some cases, soldiers (drawn from the lower classes) had turned against their aristocratic commanders and attacked them. At Nancy, General Bouillé successfully put down one such rebellion, only to be accused of being anti-revolutionary for doing so. This and other such incidents spurred a mass desertion as more and more officers defected to other countries, leaving a dearth of experienced leadership within the army.[89]</p><p>This period also saw the rise of the political clubs in French politics. Foremost among these was the Jacobin Club; 152 members had affiliated with the Jacobins by 10 August 1790. The Jacobin Society began as a broad, general organisation for political debate, but as it grew in members, various factions developed with widely differing views. Several of these factions broke off to form their own clubs, such as the Club of '89.[90]</p><p>Meanwhile, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organisation made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The King would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war. The Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers and suppressed guilds, masterships, and workers' organisations: any individual gained the right to practise a trade through the purchase of a license; strikes became illegal.[91]</p><p> Main article: Flight to Varennes</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Retour_Varennes_1791.jpg/220px-Retour_Varennes_1791.jpg" width="220" height="138"><p>


		The return of the royal family to Paris on 25 June 1791, after their failed flight to Varennes


		</p><p>
			Louis XVI was increasingly dismayed by the direction of the revolution. His brother, the Comte d'Artois and his queen, Marie Antoinette, urged a stronger stance against the revolution and support for the émigrés, while he was resistant to any course that would see him openly side with foreign powers against the Assembly. Eventually, fearing for his own safety and that of his family, he decided to flee Paris to the Austrian border, having been assured of the loyalty of the border garrisons.</p><p>Louis cast his lot with General Bouillé, who condemned both the emigration and the Assembly, and promised him refuge and support in his camp at Montmédy. On the night of 20 June 1791 the royal family fled the Tuileries Palace dressed as servants, while their servants dressed as nobles.</p><p>However, late the next day, the King was recognised and arrested at Varennes and returned to Paris. The Assembly provisionally suspended the King. He and Queen Marie Antoinette remained held under guard.[92] The King's flight had a profound impact on public opinion, turning popular sentiment further against the clergy and nobility, and built momentum for the institution of a constitutional monarchy.[92]</p><p> Main article: The Last Days of the National Constituent Assembly</p><p>As most of the Assembly still favoured a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI as little more than a figurehead: he was forced to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication.</p><p>However, Jacques Pierre Brissot drafted a petition, insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight. An immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign the petition. Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins gave fiery speeches. The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to preserve public order. The National Guard under Lafayette's command confronted the crowd. The soldiers responded to a barrage of stones by firing into the crowd, killing between 13 and 50 people.[93] The incident cost Lafayette and his National Guard much public support.</p><p>In the wake of the massacre the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs, as well as radical newspapers such as Jean-Paul Marat's L'Ami du Peuple. Danton fled to England; Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding.[94]</p><p>Meanwhile, in August 1791, a new threat arose from abroad: the King's brother-in-law Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, King Frederick William II of Prussia, and the King's brother Charles-Philippe, comte d'Artois, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, declaring their intention to bring the French king in the position to consolidate the basis of a monarchical government and that they were preparing their own troops for action,[95] hinting at an invasion of France on the King's behalf.[96]</p><p>Although Leopold himself sought to avoid war and made the declaration to satisfy the Comte d'Artois and the other émigrés, the reaction within France was ferocious. The French people expressed no respect for the dictates of foreign monarchs, and the threat of force merely hastened their militarisation.[97]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Even before the Flight to Varennes, the Assembly members had determined to debar themselves from the legislature that would succeed them, the Legislative Assembly. They now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution, and submitted it to the recently restored Louis XVI, who accepted it, writing I engage to maintain it at home, to defend it from all attacks from abroad, and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal. The King addressed the Assembly and received enthusiastic applause from members and spectators. With this capstone, the National Constituent Assembly adjourned in a final session on 30 September 1791.[98]</p><h3>Legislative Assembly (Oct.1791–Sept.1792)</h3><p>The Legislative Assembly first met on 1 October 1791, elected by those 4 million men – out of a population of 25 million – who paid a certain minimum amount of taxes.[99] Under the Constitution of 1791, France would function as a constitutional monarchy. The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly, but he retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers.</p><p>Early on, the King vetoed legislation that threatened the émigrés with death and that decreed that every non-juring clergyman must take within eight days the civic oath mandated by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Over the course of a year, such disagreements would lead to a constitutional crisis.</p><p>Late 1791, a group of Assembly members who propagated war against Austria and Prussia was, after some remark of politician Maximilien Robespierre, henceforth indicated as the 'Girondins', although not all of them really came from the southern province of Gironde. A group around Robespierre – later indicated as 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' – pleaded against that war; this opposition between those groups would harden and embitter in the next 1½ years.[95]</p><p>In response to the threat of war of August 1791 from Austria and Prussia, leaders of the Assembly saw such a war as a means to strengthen support for their revolutionary government, and the French people as well as the Assembly thought that they would win a war against Austria and Prussia. On 20 April 1792, France declared war on Austria.[95][100] Late April 1792, France invaded and conquered the Austrian Netherlands (roughly present-day Belgium and Luxembourg).[95]</p><p>The Legislative Assembly degenerated into chaos before October 1792. Francis Charles Montague concluded in 1911, In the attempt to govern, the Assembly failed altogether. It left behind an empty treasury, an undisciplined army and navy, and a people debauched by safe and successful riot.[101]</p><p>Lyons argues that the Constituent Assembly had liberal, rational, and individualistic goals that seem to have been largely achieved by 1791. However, it failed to consolidate the gains of the Revolution, which continued with increasing momentum and escalating radicalism until 1794. Lyons identifies six reasons for this escalation. First, the king did not accept the limitations on his powers, and mobilised support from foreign monarchs to reverse it. Second, the effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic Church, sell off its lands, close its monasteries and its charitable operations, and replace it with an unpopular makeshift system caused deep consternation among the pious and the peasants. Third, the economy was badly hurt by the issuance of ever increasing amounts of paper money (assignats), which caused more and more inflation; the rising prices hurt the urban poor who spent most of their income on food. Fourth, the rural peasants demanded liberation from the heavy system of taxes and dues owed to local landowners. Fifth, the working class of Paris and the other cities—the sans-culottes—resented the fact that the property owners and professionals had taken all the spoils of the Revolution. Finally, foreign powers threatened to overthrow the Revolution, which responded with extremism and systematic violence in its own defence.[102]</p><p> Main articles: 10 August (French Revolution), September Massacres, and Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy</p><br><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Jacques_Bertaux_-_Prise_du_palais_des_Tuileries_-_1793.jpg/260px-Jacques_Bertaux_-_Prise_du_palais_des_Tuileries_-_1793.jpg" width="260" height="171"><p>


		On 10 August 1792 the Paris Commune stormed the Tuileries Palace and killed the Swiss Guards


		</p><p>
			In the summer of 1792, all of Paris was against the king, and hoped that the Assembly would depose the king, but the Assembly hesitated.[103]</p><p>At dawn of 10 August 1792, a large, angry crowd of Parisians and soldiers from all over France,[103] insurgents and popular militias, supported by the revolutionary Paris Commune,[104] marched on the Tuileries Palace where the king resided,[103] assailed the Palace and killed the Swiss Guards who were assigned for the protection of the king.[104]</p><p>Around 8:00am the king decided to leave his palace and seek safety with his wife and children in the Assembly that was gathered in permanent session in Salle du Manège opposite to the Tuileries.[103] The royal family became prisoners.[105] After 11:00am, a rump session of the Legislative Assembly 'temporarily relieved the king from his task'[103] and thus suspended the monarchy; little more than a third of the deputies were present, almost all of them Jacobins.[105] In reaction, on 19 August the Prussian general Duke of Brunswick invaded France[106] and besieged Longwy.[107]</p><p>26 August, the Assembly decreed the deportation of refractory priests in the west of France, as causes of danger to the fatherland, to destinations like French Guiana. In reaction, peasants in the Vendée took over a town, in another step toward civil war.[107] What remained of a national government depended on the support of the insurrectionary Commune. With enemy troops advancing, the Commune looked for potential traitors in Paris.[108][109]</p><p>On 2, 3 and 4 September 1792, hundreds of Parisians, supporters of the revolution, infuriated by Verdun being captured by the Prussian enemy, the uprisings in the west of France, and rumours that the incarcerated prisoners in Paris were conspiring with the foreign enemy, raided the Parisian prisons and murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners, many of them Catholic priests but also common criminals. Jean-Paul Marat, a political ally of Robespierre, in an open letter on 3 September incited the rest of France to follow the Parisian example; Robespierre kept a low profile in regard to the murder orgy;[110] the Assembly and the city council of Paris (la Commune) seemed inapt and hardly motivated to call a halt to the unleashed bloodshed.[103]</p><p>The Commune sent gangs of National Guardsmen and fereres into the prisons to kill 10 or more victims, mostly nonjuring priests. The Commune then sent a circular letter to the other cities of France inviting them to follow this example, and many cities launched their own massacres of prisoners and priests in the September massacres. The Assembly could offer only feeble resistance. In October, however, there was a counterattack accusing the instigators, especially Marat, of being terrorists. This led to a political contest between the more moderate Girondists and the more radical Montagnards inside the Convention, with rumour used as a weapon by both sides. The Girondists lost ground when they seemed too conciliatory. But the pendulum swung again and after Thermidor, the men who had endorsed the massacres were denounced as terrorists.[108][109]</p><p>Chaos persisted until the Convention, elected by universal male suffrage and charged with writing a new constitution, met on 20 September 1792 and became the new de facto government of France. The next day it abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. The following day – 22 September 1792, the first morning of the new Republic – was later retroactively adopted as the beginning of Year One of the French Republican Calendar.[111]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars</h2><p> Main articles: French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars</p><p>From 1793 to 1815 France was engaged almost continuously (with two short breaks) in wars with Britain and a changing coalition of other major powers.

However, the final defeat of Napoleon in 1814 (and 1815) brought a reaction that reversed some – but not all – of the revolutionary achievements in France and Europe.

		French victory over the Prussians at the Battle of Valmy on 29 September 1792


		</p><p>
			The politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, many of the Feuillants, and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to export the Revolution throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. The forces opposing war were much weaker. Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater radicalisation of the revolution. On the other end of the political spectrum Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds, fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution, and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere. The Austrian emperor Leopold II, brother of Marie Antoinette, may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792.[112] France preemptively declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and Prussia joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later.

			The new-born Republic followed up on this success with a series of victories in Belgium and the Rhineland in the fall of 1792. The French armies defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November, and had soon taken over most of the Austrian Netherlands. This brought them into conflict with Britain and the Dutch Republic, which wished to preserve the independence of the southern Netherlands from France. After the king's execution in January 1793, these powers, along with Spain and most other European states, joined the war against France. Almost immediately, French forces faced defeat on many fronts, and were driven out of their newly conquered territories in the spring of 1793. At the same time, the republican regime was forced to deal with rebellions against its authority in much of western and southern France. But the allies failed to take advantage of French disunity, and by the autumn of 1793 the republican regime had defeated most of the internal rebellions and halted the allied advance into France itself.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The stalemate was broken in the summer of 1794 with dramatic French victories. They defeated the allied army at the Battle of Fleurus, leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands. They followed up by a campaign which swept the allies to the east bank of the Rhine and left the French, by the beginning of 1795, conquering the Dutch Republic itself. The House of Orange was expelled and replaced by the Batavian Republic, a French satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the coalition against France. Prussia, having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794, made peace with revolutionary France at Basel in April 1795, and soon thereafter Spain, too, made peace with France. Of the major powers, only Britain and Austria remained at war with France.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Fire_in_Saint-Domingo_1791%2C_German_copper_engraving.jpg/230px-Fire_in_Saint-Domingo_1791%2C_German_copper_engraving.jpg" width="230" height="147"><p>


		Slave revolt in Saint Domingue


		</p><h3>Colonial uprisings</h3><p>
			Although the French Revolution had a dramatic impact in numerous areas of Europe, the French colonies felt a particular influence. As the Martinican author Aimé Césaire put it, there was in each French colony a specific revolution, that occurred on the occasion of the French Revolution, in tune with it.[113] The Haitian Revolution (Saint Domingue) became a central example of slave uprisings in French colonies.</p><h2>First Republic</h2><h3>National Convention (Sept.1792–95)</h3><p> Main article: National Convention</p><p>Late August 1792, elections were held, now under male universal suffrage, for the new National Convention.[110]</p><p>On 20 September 1792, the new National Convention replaced the Legislative Assembly. From the start the Convention suffered from the bitter division between a group around Robespierre, Danton and Marat referred to as 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' or 'left' and a group referred to as 'Girondins' or 'right'. But the majority of the representatives, referred to as 'la Plaine', were member of neither of those two antagonistic groups and managed to preserve some speed in the Convention's debates.[110][114]</p><p>Immediately on 21 September the Convention abolished the monarchy, making France the French First Republic.[103] A new French Republican Calendar was introduced to replace the Christian Gregorian calendar, renaming the year 1792 as year 1 of the Republic.[60]</p><p>With wars against Prussia and Austria having started earlier in 1792, in November 1792 France also declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic.[114] In the course of 1793, the Holy Roman Empire, the kings of Portugal and Naples and the Grand-Duke of Tuscany declared war against France.[115]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Execution_of_Louis_XVI.jpg/250px-Execution_of_Louis_XVI.jpg" width="250" height="150"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			 Main article: Execution of Louis XVI</p><p>In the Brunswick Manifesto, the Imperial and Prussian armies threatened retaliation on the French population if it were to resist their advance or the reinstatement of the monarchy. This among other things made Louis appear to be conspiring with the enemies of France. On 17 January 1793 Louis was condemned to death for conspiracy against the public liberty and the general safety by a close majority in Convention: 361 voted to execute the king, 288 voted against, and another 72 voted to execute him subject to a variety of delaying conditions. The former Louis XVI, now simply named Citoyen Louis Capet (Citizen Louis Capet) was executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793 on the Place de la Révolution, former Place Louis XV, now called the Place de la Concorde.[116] Conservatives across Europe were horrified and monarchies called for war against revolutionary France.[117][118]</p><p>When war went badly, prices rose and the sans-culottes&nbsp;– poor labourers and radical Jacobins – rioted; counter-revolutionary activities began in some regions. This encouraged the Jacobins to seize power through a parliamentary coup, backed up by force effected by mobilising public support against the Girondist faction, and by utilising the mob power of the Parisian sans-culottes. An alliance of Jacobin and sans-culottes elements thus became the effective centre of the new government. Policy became considerably more radical, as The Law of the Maximum set food prices and led to executions of offenders.[119]</p><p>This policy of price control w<br>

Although he died young, he was one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Early life</h2><p>Born in Rouen, France, Géricault was educated in the tradition of English sporting art by Carle Vernet and classical figure composition by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, a rigorous classicist who disapproved of his student's impulsive temperament yet recognized his talent.[1] Géricault soon left the classroom, choosing to study at the Louvre, where from 1810 to 1815 he copied paintings by Rubens, Titian, Velázquez and Rembrandt. During this period at the Louvre he discovered a vitality he found lacking in the prevailing school of Neoclassicism.[1] Much of his time was spent in Versailles, where he found the stables of the palace open to him, and where he gained his knowledge of the anatomy and action of horses.[2]</p><h2>Success</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/GericaultHorseman.jpg/170px-GericaultHorseman.jpg" width="170" height="222"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The Charging Chasseur, 1812


		</p><p>
			Géricault's first major work, The Charging Chasseur, exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1812, revealed the influence of the style of Rubens and an interest in the depiction of contemporary subject matter. This youthful success, ambitious and monumental, was followed by a change in direction: for the next several years Géricault produced a series of small studies of horses and cavalrymen.[3] He exhibited Wounded Cuirassier at the Salon in 1814, a work more labored and less well received.[3] Géricault in a fit of disappointment entered the army and served for a time in the garrison of Versailles.[2] In the nearly two years that followed the 1814 Salon, he also underwent a self-imposed study of figure construction and composition, all the while evidencing a personal predilection for drama and expressive force.[4]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Th%C3%A9odore_Gericault_-_Head_of_a_Youth_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/170px-Th%C3%A9odore_Gericault_-_Head_of_a_Youth_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="170" height="206"><p>

			A trip to Florence, Rome, and Naples (1816–17), prompted in part by the desire to flee from a romantic entanglement with his aunt,[5] ignited a fascination with Michelangelo. Rome itself inspired the preparation of a monumental canvas, the Race of the Barberi Horses, a work of epic composition and abstracted theme that promised to be entirely without parallel in its time.[6] In the event, Géricault never completed the painting, and returned to France. In 1821, he painted The Derby of Epsom.</p><h2>The Raft of the Medusa</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/JEAN_LOUIS_TH%C3%89ODORE_G%C3%89RICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_%28Museo_del_Louvre%2C_1818-19%29.jpg/220px-JEAN_LOUIS_TH%C3%89ODORE_G%C3%89RICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_%28Museo_del_Louvre%2C_1818-19%29.jpg" width="220" height="150"><p>


		The Raft of the Medusa, 1819



		</p><p>
			 Main article: The Raft of the Medusa</p><p>Géricault continually returned to the military themes of his early paintings, and the series of lithographs he undertook on military subjects after his return from Italy are considered some of the earliest masterworks in that medium. Perhaps his most significant, and certainly most ambitious work, is The Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), which depicted the aftermath of a contemporary French shipwreck, Meduse, in which the captain had left the crew and passengers to die.[7] The incident became a national scandal, and Géricault's dramatic interpretation presented a contemporary tragedy on a monumental scale. The painting's notoriety stemmed from its indictment of a corrupt establishment, but it also dramatized a more eternal theme, that of man's struggle with nature.[8] It surely excited the imagination of the young Eugène Delacroix, who posed for one of the dying figures.[9]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The classical depiction of the figures and structure of the composition stand in contrast to the turbulence of the subject, so that the painting constitutes an important bridge between neo-classicism and romanticism.

While in London, Géricault witnessed urban poverty, made drawings of his impressions, and published lithographs based on these observations which were free of sentimentality.[11] He associated much there with Charlet, the lithographer and caricaturist.[2]</p><h2>Later life</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Perelachaise-Gericault-p1000405.jpg/220px-Perelachaise-Gericault-p1000405.jpg" width="220" height="165"><p>


		Monument at Géricault's tomb, by sculptor Antoine Étex


		</p><p>
			After his return to France in 1821, Géricault was inspired to paint a series of ten portraits of the insane, the patients of a friend, Dr. Étienne-Jean Georget, a pioneer in psychiatric medicine, with each subject exhibiting a different affliction.[12] There are five remaining portraits from the series, including Insane Woman. The paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in Géricault's family, as well as the artist's own fragile mental health.[13] His observations of the human subject were not confined to the living, for some remarkable still-lifes—painted studies of severed heads and limbs—have also been ascribed to the artist.[14] Géricault's last efforts were directed toward preliminary studies for several epic compositions, including the Opening of the Doors of the Spanish Inquisition and the African Slave Trade.[15] The preparatory drawings suggest works of great ambition, but Géricault's waning health intervened. Weakened by riding accidents and chronic tubercular infection, Géricault died in Paris in 1824 after a long period of suffering. His bronze figure reclines, brush in hand, on his tomb at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, above a low-relief panel of The Raft of the Medusa.</p><h2>Works</h2><h2>Les Monomanes (Portraits of the Insane)</h2><h2>Sources</h2><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Théodore_Géricault&amp;oldid=784097442"

		Manet's portrait painted by Fantin-Latour


		</p><p>
			Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, in the ancestral hôtel particulier (mansion) on the rue des Petits Augustins (now rue Bonaparte) to an affluent and well-connected family.[1] His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the daughter of a diplomat and goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince Charles Bernadotte, from whom the Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet, was a French judge who expected Édouard to pursue a career in law. His uncle, Edmond Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and took young Manet to the Louvre.[2] In 1841 he enrolled at secondary school, the Collège Rollin. In 1845, at the advice of his uncle, Manet enrolled in a special course of drawing where he met Antonin Proust, future Minister of Fine Arts and subsequent lifelong friend.</p><p>At his father's suggestion, in 1848 he sailed on a training vessel to Rio de Janeiro. After he twice failed the examination to join the Navy,[3] his father relented to his wishes to pursue an art education. From 1850 to 1856, Manet studied under the academic painter Thomas Couture. In his spare time, Manet copied the Old Masters in the Louvre.</p><p>From 1853 to 1856, Manet visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he was influenced by the Dutch painter Frans Hals, and the Spanish artists Diego Velázquez and Francisco José de Goya.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>In 1856, Manet opened a studio. His style in this period was characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details and the suppression of transitional tones. Adopting the current style of realism initiated by Gustave Courbet, he painted The Absinthe Drinker (1858–59) and other contemporary subjects such as beggars, singers, Gypsies, people in cafés, and bullfights. After his early career, he rarely painted religious, mythological, or historical subjects; examples include his Christ Mocked, now in the Art Institute of Chicago, and Christ with Angels, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Manet had two canvases accepted at the Salon in 1861. A portrait of his mother and father, who at the time was paralysed and robbed of speech by a stroke, was ill-received by critics. The other, The Spanish Singer, was admired by Theophile Gautier, and placed in a more conspicuous location as a result of its popularity with Salon-goers. Manet's work, which appeared slightly slapdash when compared with the meticulous style of so many other Salon paintings, intrigued some young artists. The Spanish Singer, painted in a strange new fashion [-] caused many painters' eyes to open and their jaws to drop.[4]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Music in the Tuileries</h3><p> Main article: Music in the Tuileries</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/MANET_-_M%C3%BAsica_en_las_Tuller%C3%ADas_%28National_Gallery%2C_Londres%2C_1862%29.jpg/220px-MANET_-_M%C3%BAsica_en_las_Tuller%C3%ADas_%28National_Gallery%2C_Londres%2C_1862%29.jpg" width="220" height="140"><p>


		Music in the Tuileries, 1862


		</p><p>
			Music in the Tuileries is an early example of Manet's painterly style. Inspired by Hals and Velázquez, it is a harbinger of his lifelong interest in the subject of leisure.</p><p>While the picture was regarded as unfinished by some,[2] the suggested atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.</p><p>Here, Manet has depicted his friends, artists, authors, and musicians who take part, and he has included a self-portrait among the subjects.</p><h3>Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)</h3><p> Main article: Le déjeuner sur l'herbe</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Edouard_Manet_-_Luncheon_on_the_Grass_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Edouard_Manet_-_Luncheon_on_the_Grass_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="171"><p>


		The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863


		</p><p>
			A major early work is The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe). The Paris Salon rejected it for exhibition in 1863 but Manet exhibited it at the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the Rejected) later in the year. Emperor Napoleon III had initiated The Salon des Refusés after the Paris Salon rejected 2,783 paintings in 1863. Manet employed model Victorine Meurent, his wife Suzanne, future brother-in-law Ferdinand Leenhoff, and one of his brothers to pose. Meurent also posed for several more of Manet's important paintings including Olympia; and by the mid-1870s she became an accomplished painter in her own right.</p><p>The painting's juxtaposition of fully dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving of the Judgement of Paris (c. 1515) based on a drawing by Raphael.[2]</p><p>Two additional works cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l'herbe are Pastoral Concert (c. 1510, The Louvre) and The Tempest (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), both of which are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian.[5] The Tempest is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and breastfeeding a baby; the relationship between the two figures is unclear.[6] In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>Olympia</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Edouard_Manet_-_Olympia_-_Google_Art_Project_3.jpg/220px-Edouard_Manet_-_Olympia_-_Google_Art_Project_3.jpg" width="220" height="149"><p>


		Olympia, 1863



		</p><p>
			 Main article: Olympia (Manet)</p><p>As he had in Luncheon on the Grass, Manet again paraphrased a respected work by a Renaissance artist in the painting Olympia (1863), a nude portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose pose was based on Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538). The painting is also reminiscent of Francisco Goya's painting The Nude Maja (1800).</p><p>Manet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn by offended viewers.[7] The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed.[2] That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.</p><p>Olympia's body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's shamelessly flexed left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus.[8] Likewise, the alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.</p><p>Olympia was the subject of caricatures in the popular press, but was championed by the French avant-garde community, and the painting's significance was appreciated by artists such as Gustave Courbet, Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet, and later Paul Gauguin.</p><p>As with Luncheon on the Grass, the painting raised the issue of prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within society.[2]</p><h3>Life and times</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Edouard_Manet_-_Berthe_Morisot_With_a_Bouquet_of_Violets_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/170px-Edouard_Manet_-_Berthe_Morisot_With_a_Bouquet_of_Violets_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="170" height="231"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets, 1872


		</p><p>
			After the death of his father in 1862, Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff in 1863. Leenhoff was a Dutch-born piano teacher of Manet's age with whom he had been romantically involved for approximately ten years. Leenhoff initially had been employed by Manet's father, Auguste, to teach Manet and his younger brother piano. She also may have been Auguste's mistress. In 1852, Leenhoff gave birth, out of wedlock, to a son, Leon Koella Leenhoff. Manet painted his wife in The Reading, among other paintings.</p><p>Eleven-year-old Leon Leenhoff, whose father may have been either of the Manets, posed often for Manet. Most famously, he is the subject of the Boy Carrying a Sword of 1861 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He also appears as the boy carrying a tray in the background of The Balcony.[9]</p><p>He became friends with the Impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne and Camille Pissarro through another painter, Berthe Morisot, who was a member of the group and drew him into their activities. The grand niece of the painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot had her first painting accepted in the Salon de Paris in 1864, and she continued to show in the salon for the next ten years.</p><p>Manet became the friend and colleague of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is credited with convincing Manet to attempt plein air painting, which she had been practicing since she was introduced to it by another friend of hers, Camille Corot. They had a reciprocating relationship and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In 1874, she became his sister-in-law when she married his brother, Eugène.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Edouard_Manet_060.jpg/170px-Edouard_Manet_060.jpg" width="170" height="208"><p>


		Self-Portrait with Palette, 1879


		</p><p>
			Unlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern artists should seek to exhibit at the Paris Salon rather than abandon it in favor of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was excluded from the International Exhibition of 1867, he set up his own exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.</p><p>Although his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. Eva Gonzalès, a daughter of the novelist Emmanuel Gonzalès, was his only formal student.</p><p>He was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot. Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors: after the early 1870s he made less use of dark backgrounds but retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor (plein air) pieces, but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the studio.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Manet enjoyed a close friendship with composer Emmanuel Chabrier, painting two portraits of him; the musician owned 14 of Manet's paintings and dedicated his Impromptu to Manet's wife.[10]</p><p>Throughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could number as his champions Émile Zola, who supported him publicly in the press, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Charles Baudelaire, who challenged him to depict life as it was. Manet, in turn, drew or painted each of them.</p><h3>Cafe scenes</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Edouard_Manet_-_At_the_Caf%C3%A9_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/170px-Edouard_Manet_-_At_the_Caf%C3%A9_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="170" height="209"><p>

		</p><p>
			Manet's paintings of café scenes are observations of social life in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based At the Cafe in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a flâneur. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing Hals and Velázquez, yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of bohemianism, urban working people, as well as some of the bourgeoisie.</p><p>In Corner of a Cafe Concert, a man smokes while behind him a waitress serves drinks. In The Beer Drinkers a woman enjoys her beer in the company of a friend. In The Cafe Concert, shown at right, a sophisticated gentleman sits at a bar while a waitress stands resolutely in the background, sipping her drink. In The Waitress, a serving woman pauses for a moment behind a seated customer smoking a pipe, while a ballet dancer, with arms extended as she is about to turn, is on stage in the background.</p><p>Manet also sat at the restaurant on the Avenue de Clichy called Pere Lathuille's, which had a garden in addition to the dining area. One of the paintings he produced here was Chez le père Lathuille (At Pere Lathuille's), in which a man displays an unrequited interest in a woman dining near him.</p><p>In Le Bon Bock (1873), a large, cheerful, bearded man sits with a pipe in one hand and a glass of beer in the other, looking straight at the viewer.</p><h3>Paintings of social activities</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Edouard_Manet_053.jpg/220px-Edouard_Manet_053.jpg" width="220" height="112"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		The Races at Longchamp, 1864


		</p><p>
			Manet painted the upper class enjoying more formal social activities. In Masked Ball at the Opera, Manet shows a lively crowd of people enjoying a party. Men stand with top hats and long black suits while talking to women with masks and costumes. He included portraits of his friends in this picture.</p><p>His 1868 painting The Luncheon was posed in the dining room of the Manet house.</p><p>Manet depicted other popular activities in his work. In The Races at Longchamp, an unusual perspective is employed to underscore the furious energy of racehorses as they rush toward the viewer.

			Manet's response to modern life included works devoted to war, in subjects that may be seen as updated interpretations of the genre of history painting.[12] The first such work was the Battle of the Kearsarge and Alabama (1864), a sea skirmish known as the Battle of Cherbourg from the American Civil War which took place off the French coast, and may have been witnessed by the artist.[13]</p><p>Of interest next was the French intervention in Mexico; from 1867 to 1869 Manet painted three versions of the Execution of Emperor Maximilian, an event which raised concerns regarding French foreign and domestic policy.[14] The several versions of the Execution are among Manet's largest paintings, which suggests that the theme was one which the painter regarded as most important. Its subject is the execution by Mexican firing squad of a Habsburg emperor who had been installed by Napoleon III. Neither the paintings nor a lithograph of the subject were permitted to be shown in France.[15] As an indictment of formalized slaughter the paintings look back to Goya,[16] and anticipate Picasso's Guernica.</p><p>In January 1871, Manet traveled to Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the Pyrenees. In his absence his friends added his name to the Fédération des artistes (see: Courbet) of the Paris Commune. Manet stayed away from Paris, perhaps, until after the semaine sanglante: in a letter to Berthe Morisot at Cherbourg (10 June 1871) he writes, We came back to Paris a few days ago... (the semaine sanglante ended on 28 May).</p><p>The prints and drawings collection of the Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest) has a watercolour/gouache by Manet, The Barricade, depicting a summary execution of Communards by Versailles troops based on a lithograph of the execution of Maximilian. A similar piece, The Barricade (oil on plywood), is held by a private collector.</p><p>On 18 March 1871, he wrote to his (confederate) friend Félix Bracquemond in Paris about his visit to Bordeaux, the provisory seat of the French National Assembly of the Third French Republic where Émile Zola introduced him to the sites: I never imagined that France could be represented by such doddering old fools, not excepting that little twit Thiers...[17] If this could be interpreted as support of the Commune, a following letter to Bracquemond (21 March 1871) expressed his idea more clearly: Only party hacks and the ambitious, the Henrys of this world following on the heels of the Milliéres, the grotesque imitators of the Commune of 1793... He knew the communard Lucien Henry to have been a former painter's model and Millière, an insurance agent. What an encouragement all these bloodthirsty caperings are for the arts! But there is at least one consolation in our misfortunes: that we're not politicians and have no desire to be elected as deputies.</p><h3>Paris</h3><p>Manet depicted many scenes of the streets of Paris in his works. The Rue Mosnier Decked with Flags depicts red, white, and blue pennants covering buildings on either side of the street; another painting of the same title features a one-legged man walking with crutches. Again depicting the same street, but this time in a different context, is Rue Mosnier with Pavers, in which men repair the roadway while people and horses move past.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Edouard_Manet_-_Le_Chemin_de_fer_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/220px-Edouard_Manet_-_Le_Chemin_de_fer_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" width="220" height="179"><p>


		The Railway, 1873


		</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>
			The Railway, widely known as The Gare Saint-Lazare, was painted in 1873. The setting is the urban landscape of Paris in the late 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, Victorine Meurent, also the model for Olympia and the Luncheon on the Grass, sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl with her back to the painter, watching a train pass beneath them.</p><p>Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opts for the iron grating which boldly stretches across the canvas[18] The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. In the distance, modern apartment buildings are seen. This arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored.</p><p>Historian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. Caricaturists ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today.[19] The painting is currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.[20]</p><p>Manet painted several boating subjects in 1874. Boating, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, exemplifies in its conciseness the lessons Manet learned from Japanese prints, and the abrupt cropping by the frame of the boat and sail adds to the immediacy of the image.[21]</p><p>In 1875, a book-length French edition of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven included lithographs by Manet and translation by Mallarmé.[22]</p><p>In 1881, with pressure from his friend Antonin Proust, the French government awarded Manet the Légion d'honneur.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Edouard_Manet%2C_A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Berg%C3%A8re.jpg/220px-Edouard_Manet%2C_A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Berg%C3%A8re.jpg" width="220" height="164"><p>

			In his mid-forties Manet's health deteriorated, and he developed severe pain and partial paralysis in his legs. In 1879 he began receiving hydrotherapy treatments at a spa near Meudon intended to improve what he believed was a circulatory problem, but in reality he was suffering from locomotor ataxia, a known side-effect of syphilis.[23][24] In 1880, he painted a portrait there of the opera singer Émilie Ambre as Carmen. Ambre and her lover Gaston de Beauplan had an estate in Meudon and had organized the first exhibition of Manet's The Execution of Emperor Maximilian in New York in December 1879.[25]</p><p>In his last years Manet painted many small-scale still lifes of fruits and vegetables, such as Bunch of Asparagus and The Lemon (both 1880).[26] He completed his last major work, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère), in 1882 and it hung in the Salon that year. Afterwards he limited himself to small formats. His last paintings were of flowers in glass vases.[27]</p><h2>Death</h2><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In April 1883, his left foot was amputated because of gangrene, and he died eleven days later in Paris.

His extant works, as catalogued in 1975 by Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein, comprise 430 oil paintings, 89 pastels, and more than 400 works on paper.[28]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Manet-grave.jpg/170px-Manet-grave.jpg" width="170" height="227"><p>


		The grave of Manet at Passy

			Although harshly condemned by critics who decried its lack of conventional finish, Manet's work had admirers from the beginning. One was Émile Zola, who wrote in 1867: We are not accustomed to seeing such simple and direct translations of reality. Then, as I said, there is such a surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it is a truly charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality.[29]</p><p>The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in Manet's paintings was seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance works he copied or used as source material. He rejected the technique he had learned in the studio of Thomas Couture – in which a painting was constructed using successive layers of paint on a dark-toned ground – in favor of a direct, alla prima method using opaque paint on a light ground. Novel at the time, this method made possible the completion of a painting in a single sitting. It was adopted by the Impressionists, and became the prevalent method of painting in oils for generations that followed.[30] Manet's work is considered early modern, partially because of the opaque flatness of his surfaces, the frequent sketchlike passages, and the black outlining of figures, all of which draw attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint.</p><p>The art historian Beatrice Farwell says Manet has been universally regarded as the Father of Modernism. With Courbet he was among the first to take serious risks with the public whose favour he sought, the first to make alla prima painting the standard technique for oil painting and one of the first to take liberties with Renaissance perspective and to offer ‘pure painting’ as a source of aesthetic pleasure. He was a pioneer, again with Courbet, in the rejection of humanistic and historical subject-matter, and shared with Degas the establishment of modern urban life as acceptable material for high art.[30]</p><p>Short introductory works:</p><p>Longer works:</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Édouard_Manet&amp;oldid=784150117"

Madame X was painted not as a commission, but at the request of Sargent.[1] It is a study in opposition. Sargent shows a woman posing in a black satin dress with jeweled straps, a dress that reveals and hides at the same time. The portrait is characterized by the pale flesh tone of the subject contrasted against a dark colored dress and background.</p><p>For Sargent, the scandal resulting from the painting's controversial reception at the Paris Salon of 1884 amounted to the temporary set-back to Sargent while in France,[2] though it may have helped him later establish a successful career in Britain and America.[3]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Background</h2><p>The model was an American expatriate who married a French banker, and became notorious in Parisian high society for her beauty and rumored infidelities. She wore lavender powder and prided herself on her appearance. The English-language term professional beauty was used to refer to her and to a woman in general who uses personal skills to advance herself socially.[4] Her unconventional beauty made her an object of fascination for artists; the American painter Edward Simmons claimed that he could not stop stalking her as one does a deer.[5] Sargent was also impressed, and anticipated that a portrait of Gautreau would garner much attention at the upcoming Paris Salon, and increase interest in portrait commissions. He wrote to a friend:</p><p>I have a great desire to paint her portrait and have reason to think she would allow it and is waiting for someone to propose this homage to her beauty. If you are 'bien avec elle' and will see her in Paris, you might tell her I am a man of prodigious talent.[6]</p><p>Although she had refused numerous similar requests from artists, Gautreau accepted Sargent's offer in February 1883.[7] Sargent was an expatriate like Gautreau, and their collaboration has been interpreted as motivated by a shared desire to attain high status in French society.[8]</p><h2>Studies</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Madame_Gautreau_by_John_Singer_Sargent_circa_1883.jpeg/220px-Madame_Gautreau_by_John_Singer_Sargent_circa_1883.jpeg" width="220" height="307"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		A figure study by Sargent in watercolor and graphite, c. 1883


		</p><p>
			Little progress was made during the winter of 1883, as Gautreau was distracted by social engagements, and was not by nature inclined to the discipline of sitting for a portrait. At her suggestion, Sargent traveled to her estate in Brittany in June, where he commenced a series of preparatory works in pencil, watercolors, and oils.[9] About thirty drawings resulted from these sessions, in which many poses were attempted. Like the eventual portrait, an oil sketch entitled Madame Gautreau Drinking a Toast (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), shows the subject's profile and bare arms against a dark background, but is of a more freely brushed and informal character.</p><p>Just as she had been in Paris, in the country Gautreau was bored by the process of sitting; here, too, there were social engagements, as well as the responsibilities of tending to her four-year-old daughter, her mother, house guests, and a full domestic staff. Sargent complained of the unpaintable beauty and hopeless laziness of Madame Gautreau.[10]</p><h2>Execution</h2><p>As in his previous entries to the Salon, The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit and El Jaleo, Sargent chose a canvas of dimensions large enough to ensure notice on the crowded Salon walls. The pose proved to be different from any of those tried in the preliminary works. It necessitated that Gautreau stand with her body facing the artist while her head was turned away, her right arm extended behind her for support, her hand on a low table; the result was to create tension in the neck and arm as well as to emphasize the subject's elegant contours.[11] For painting the artificial tone of Gautreau's pale skin, Sargent used a palette composed of lead white, rose madder, vermilion, viridian, and bone black.[11]</p><p>Even when composition had been decided upon and painting started, work progressed slowly. In a letter to a friend Sargent wrote One day I was dissatisfied with it and dashed a tone of light rose over the former gloomy background... The élancée figure of the model shows to much greater advantage.[12] On September 7, Sargent wrote still at Paramé, basking in the sunshine of my beautiful model's countenance.[12] By the fall, Sargent's interest in the venture was nearing completion: The summer is definitely over and with it, I admit, is my pleasure at being at Les Chênes [Gautreau's estate].[13]</p><h2>Description</h2><p>There is an assertion and showiness in the expanse of white skin – from her high forehead down her graceful neck, shoulders, and arms. Although the black of her dress is bold, it is also deep, recessive and mysterious. She is surrounded by a rich brown which is at once luminous and dark enough to provide contrast to the skin tones. Most disconcerting is the whiteness of the skin, an overt contrivance of aristocratic pallor; by contrast her red ear is a jarring reminder of the color of flesh unadorned.[8]</p><p>Sargent chose the pose for Gautreau carefully: her body boldly faces forward while her head is turned in profile. A profile is both assertion and retreat; half of the face is hidden while, at the same time, the part that shows can seem more defined than full face.</p><p>The table provides support for Gautreau, and echoes her curves and stance. At the time, her pose was considered sexually suggestive. As originally exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down Gautreau's right shoulder, suggesting the possibility of further revelation; One more struggle, wrote a critic in Le Figaro, and the lady will be free. (Perhaps unknown to the critic, the bodice was constructed over a metal and whalebone foundation and could not have possibly fallen; the shoulder straps were ornamental).</p><p>The image's erotic suggestion is of a distinctly upper-class sort: unnaturally pale skin, cinched waist, severity of profile and an emphasis on aristocratic bone structure all imply a distant sexuality under the professional control of the sitter, rather than offered for the viewer's delectation.[8]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
<div class="content"><p>Classical sources, such as the figures in a fresco by Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati), have been suggested as inspiration for the pose.[14] The painting features several subtle classical references: sirens of Greek mythology adorn the table's legs, and the crescent tiara worn by Gautreau symbolizes the goddess Diana. The latter was not contrived by the artist, but was part of Gautreau's self-display.[12]</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>While the work was in progress, Gautreau was enthusiastic; she believed that Sargent was painting a masterpiece.[15] When the painting first appeared at the Paris Salon under the title Portrait de Mme *** in 1884, people were shocked and scandalized; the attempt to preserve the subject's anonymity was unsuccessful, and the sitter's mother requested that Sargent withdraw the painting from the exhibition. Sargent refused, saying he had painted her exactly as she was dressed, that nothing could be said of the canvas worse than had been said in print of her appearance.[16] Later, Sargent overpainted the shoulder strap to raise it up and make it look more securely fastened. He also changed the title, from the original Portrait de Mme ***, to Madame X – a name more assertive, dramatic and mysterious, and, by accenting the impersonal, giving the illusion of the woman archetype.</p><p>The poor public and critical reception was a disappointment to both artist and model. Gautreau was humiliated by the affair, and Sargent would soon leave Paris and move to London permanently.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p>Sargent hung Madame X first in his Paris studio, and later in his studio in London. Starting in 1905, he displayed it in a number of international exhibitions. In 1916, Sargent sold the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, writing to its director I suppose it is the best thing I have ever done.[17][18] A second, unfinished version of the same pose, in which the position of the right shoulder strap remained unresolved, is in Tate, London.[18]</p><p>Seven years after Sargent painted Madame Gautreau, Gustave Courtois painted her. As in the earlier painting, the portrait shows her face in profile. She wears the same style of dress, with Courtois's portrait showing a bit more skin. The strap of her dress hangs off her shoulder much as it had in Sargent's portrait. This time, however, the portrait was well received by the public. In 1897 Gautreau posed yet again for a standing portrait, for what would be her favorite version, by Antonio de La Gándara.[13]</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portrait_of_Madame_X&amp;oldid=777833593"

The painting, which uses a palette of gray, black, and white, is regarded by many art critics as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history.[2] Standing at 3.49 meters (11&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in) tall and 7.76 meters (25&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in) wide, the large mural shows the suffering of people wrenched by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, and flames.</p><p>The painting was created in response to the bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country village in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italian warplanes at the request of the Spanish Nationalists. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (Paris International Exposition) in the 1937 World's Fair in Paris and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.[3] The painting became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Commission</h2><p>In January 1937, the Spanish Republican government commissioned Picasso to create a large mural for the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. At the time, Picasso was living in Paris, where he had been named Honorary Director-in-Exile of the Prado Museum. He had last visited Spain in 1934 and never returned.[4] His initial sketches for the project, on which he worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April, depicted his perennial theme of the artist's studio.[1] Immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, the poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso and urged him to make the bombing his subject.[1] However, it was only on 1 May, having read George Steer's eyewitness account of the bombing (originally published in both The Times and The New York Times on 28 April), that he abandoned his initial project and started sketching a series of preliminary drawings for Guernica.[5]</p><h2>Historical context</h2><h3>Bombing of 26 April 1937</h3><p>Guernica is a town in the province of Biscay in Basque Country. During the Spanish Civil War, it was regarded as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture, adding to its significance as a target.[6]</p><p>The Republican forces were made up of assorted factions (Communists, Socialists, Anarchists and others) with differing goals, but united in their opposition to the Nationalists. The Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, sought a return to pre-Republican Spain, based on law, order, and traditional Catholic values.[7]</p><p>At about 16:30 on Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the German Condor Legion, commanded by Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, bombed Guernica for about two hours. Germany, at this time led by Hitler, had lent material support to the Nationalists. Later, intense aerial bombardment became a crucial preliminary step in the Blitzkrieg tactic.[8][6]</p><p>In his journal for 30 April 1937, von Richthofen wrote:</p><p>When the first Junkers squadron arrived, there was smoke already everywhere (from the VB [VB/88] which had attacked with 3 aircraft); nobody would identify the targets of roads, bridge, and suburb, and so they just dropped everything right into the center. The 250s toppled a number of houses and destroyed the water mains. The incendiaries now could spread and become effective. The materials of the houses: tile roofs, wooden porches, and half-timbering resulted in complete annihilation. Most inhabitants were away because of a holiday; a majority of the rest left town immediately at the beginning [of the bombardment]. A small number perished in shelters that were hit.[9]</p><p>Other accounts state that the town's inhabitants were in fact congregated in the center of town, as it was market day, and when the bombardment commenced, were unable to escape because the roads were full of debris and the bridges leading out of town had been destroyed.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H25224%2C_Guernica%2C_Ruinen.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-H25224%2C_Guernica%2C_Ruinen.jpg" width="220" height="169"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Guernica in ruins, 1937


		</p><p>
			Guernica's location was at a major crossroads 10 kilometers from the front lines and between the front lines and Bilbao, the capital of Bizkaia (Biscay). Any Republican retreat towards Bilbao and any Nationalist advance towards Bilbao had to pass through Guernica. During 25 April, many of the demoralized (Republican) troops from Marquina fell back on Guernica, which lay 10 kilometers behind the lines.[10] Wolfram von Richthofen's war diary entry for 26 April 1937 states, K/88 [the Condor Legion bomber force] was targeted at Guernica in order to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here. Under the German concept of tactical bombing, areas that were routes of transportation and troop movement were considered to be legitimate military targets, and tactical aircraft tended to operate just outside the range of friendly artillery; in the German mindset, Guernica was thus a major target in support of the Republican offensive. The following day, Richthofen wrote in his war diary, Guernica burning.[11] The Republican retreat towards Bilbao did pass through Guernica, before and after the bombing, and, as Beevor points out, At Guernica the communist Rosa Luxemburg Battalion under Major Cristobal held back the nationalists for a time.[11]</p><p>Guernica was a quiet village. The nearest military target of any consequence was a factory on the outskirts of the town, which manufactured various war products. The factory went through the attack unscathed. Thus, the motivation of the bombing was one of intimidation.</p><h3>Aftermath</h3><p>Because a majority of the town's men were away, engaged in fighting on behalf of the Republicans, the town at the time of the bombing was populated mostly by women and children.[12] These demographics are reflected in the painting because, as Rudolf Arnheim writes, for Picasso: The women and children make Guernica the image of innocent, defenseless humanity victimized. Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind. Clearly, the Nationalists sought to demoralize the Republicans and the civilian population as a whole by demonstrating their military might on a town that stood for traditional Basque culture and innocent civilians.[6]</p><p>After the bombing, the work of the Basque and Republican sympathizer and The Times journalist George Steer propelled this event onto the international scene and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention. Steer's eyewitness account was published on 28 April in both The Times and The New York Times, and on the 29th appeared in L'Humanité, a French Communist daily. Steer wrote:</p><p>Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basques and the centre of their cultural tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium incendiary projectiles. The fighters, meanwhile, plunged low from above the centre of the town to machinegun those of the civilian population who had taken refuge in the fields.[12]</p><p>While Picasso was living in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II, one German officer allegedly asked him, upon seeing a photo of Guernica in his apartment, Did you do that? Picasso responded, No, you did.[13]</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The photographer Dora Maar—who had worked with Picasso since mid-1936, photographing his studio and teaching him the technique of cameraless photography—[14] documented the stages Guernica went through on its way to completion. Apart from their documentary and publicity value, Maar's photographs helped Picasso to eschew color and give the work the black-and-white immediacy of a photograph, according to John Richardson.[1] The work was painted using a matte house paint specially formulated at Picasso's request to have the least possible gloss.[1] Previously, Picasso had rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work, but he admitted influential visitors to his studio to observe the progress of the painting, believing that the publicity to be gained would help the antifascist cause.[1]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>As he worked on the mural, Picasso said: The Spanish struggle is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death.[15]</p><p>After 35 days of work, he finished the painting on 4 June 1937.[1]</p><h2>Composition</h2><p>The scene is within a room where, at an open end on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is occupied by a horse falling in agony as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. The large gaping wound in the horse's side is a major focus of the painting. Under the horse is a dead, apparently dismembered soldier; his hand on a severed arm still grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. On the open palm of the dead soldier is a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head (the bare bulb of the torturer's cell).</p><p>To the upper right of the horse, a frightened female figure, who seems to be witnessing the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned very close to the bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.</p><p>Two hidden images formed by the horse appear in Guernica:</p><p>The bull's tail forms the image of a flame with smoke rising from it, seemingly appearing in a window created by the lighter shade of gray surrounding it.</p><h2>Symbolism and interpretations</h2><p>Interpretations of Guernica vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso's career.</p><p>When pressed to explain the elements in Guernica, Picasso said,</p><p>...this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse... If you give a meaning to certain things in my paintings it may be very true, but it is not my idea to give this meaning. What ideas and conclusions you have got I obtained too, but instinctively, unconsciously. I make the painting for the painting. I paint the objects for what they are.[16]</p><p>In The Dream and Lie of Franco, a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World's Fair, Franco is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.</p><p>According to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: The shape and posture of the bodies express protest; Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos; flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war; the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre; The light bulb in the painting represents the sun; and The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors.[8]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Alejandro Escalona said, The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you—especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room.[17]</p><p>In drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project,[18] that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of Guernica, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez. In his chef d'oeuvre, Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, Guernica should be seen as Picasso’s comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.[19]</p><h2>Exhibition</h2><h3>1937 Paris International Exhibition</h3><p>Guernica was initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition.[20] The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government's struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition's technology theme. The Pavilion's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:</p><p>The display of Guernica was accompanied by a poem by Paul Éluard, and the pavilion displayed The Reaper by Joan Miró and Mercury Fountain by Alexander Calder, both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.</p><p>At its unveiling at the Paris Exhibition it garnered little attention. The public's reaction to Guernica was mixed.[21] Max Aub, one of the officials in charge of the Spanish pavilion, was compelled to defend the work against a group of Spanish officials who objected to the mural's modernist style and sought to replace it with a more traditional painting that was also commissioned for the exhibition, Madrid 1937 (Black Aeroplanes) by Horacio Ferrer de Morgado.[1] Some Marxist groups criticized Picasso's painting as lacking in political commitment and faulted it for not offering a vision of a better future.[22] In contrast, Morgado's painting was a great success with Spanish Communists and with the public.[1] The art critic Clement Greenberg was also critical of Guernica, but for different reasons.[23] In a later essay, Greenberg termed Guernica jerky and too compressed for its size, and compared it unfavorably to the magnificently lyrical The Charnel House (1944–48), a later antiwar painting by Picasso.[24]</p><p>Among the painting's admirers were the art critic Jean Cassou and the poet José Bergamín, both of whom praised the painting as quintessentially Spanish.[25] Michel Leiris perceived in the painting a foreshadowing: On a black and white canvas that depicts ancient tragedy ... Picasso also writes our letter of doom: all that we love is going to be lost...[26]</p><h3>European tour</h3><p>Guernica, for which Picasso was paid Fr200,000 for his costs by the Spanish Republican government, was one of the few major paintings that were not sold directly from artist to his exclusive contracted art dealer and friend, Paul Rosenberg.[27]</p><p>However, after its exhibition Rosenberg organised a four-man extravaganza Scandinavian tour of 118 works by Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Henri Laurens. The main attraction was Guernica, and from January to April 1938 the tour visited Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Göteborg. In September 1938 the painting travelled to England, exhibited in London's Whitechapel Art Gallery organized by Roland Penrose with Clement Attlee, where it arrived on 30 September 1938, the same day the Munich Agreement was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled onwards to Leeds, Liverpool and in early 1939 Manchester. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn &amp; Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks.[28] It then returned briefly to France.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h3>American tour</h3><p>After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later SFMOMA) gave the work its first public, free appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City then mounted an important Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940, entitled: Picasso: 40 Years of His Art, that was organized by Alfred H. Barr in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibition contained 344 works, including Guernica and its studies.[29]</p><p>At Picasso's request the safekeeping of the piece was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.[4] Between 1939 and 1952, the painting traveled extensively in the United States; between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in Brazil, at the first-ever Picasso retrospective in Milan, Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities, before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso's seventy-fifth birthday. It then went on to Chicago and Philadelphia. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA's third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso's preliminary studies and some of Dora Maar's photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, Guernica itself remained at MoMA.[4]</p><p>During the Vietnam War, the room containing the painting became the site of occasional anti-war vigils. These were usually peaceful and uneventful, but on 28 February 1974, Tony Shafrazi—ostensibly protesting Second Lieutenant William Calley's petition for habeas corpus following his indictment and sentencing for the murder of 109 Vietnamese civilians during the My Lai massacre—defaced the painting with red spray paint, painting the words KILL LIES ALL; the paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.[30]</p><h2>Establishment in Spain</h2><p>As early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having Guernica come to Spain.[4] However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of public liberties and democratic institutions. Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic constitutional monarchy, ratified by a new constitution in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of their greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981. The Spanish historian Javier Tusell was one of the negotiators.</p><p>Upon its arrival in Spain in September 1981,[31] it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens[32] at the Casón del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, 25 October.[31] The exhibition was visited by almost a million people in the first year.[33] Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Mural_del_Gernika.jpg/220px-Mural_del_Gernika.jpg" width="220" height="115"><p>

			In 1992, the painting was moved from the Museo del Prado to a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works.[34] This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso's will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to. At the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.[35]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Basque nationalists have advocated that the picture should be brought to the Basque country,[36] especially after the building of the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum. Officials at the Reina Sofía claim[37] that the canvas is now thought to be too fragile to move. Even the staff of the Guggenheim do not see a permanent transfer of the painting as possible, although the Basque government continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in Bilbao.[35]</p><h2>Tapestry at the United Nations</h2><p>A tapestry copy of Picasso's Guernica is displayed on the wall of the United Nations Building in New York City at the entrance to the Security Council room. It was displayed first from 1985 to 2009, and returned in 2015. It was commissioned in 1955 by Nelson Rockefeller, since Picasso refused to sell him the original.[38] The tapestry was placed on loan to the United Nations by the Rockefeller estate in 1985.[39] The tapestry is less monochromatic than the original and uses several shades of brown.</p><p>On 5 February 2003 a large blue curtain was placed to cover this work at the UN, so that it would not be visible in the background when Colin Powell and John Negroponte gave press conferences at the United Nations.[40] On the following day, it was claimed that the curtain was placed there at the request of television news crews, who had complained that the wild lines and screaming figures made for a bad backdrop, and that a horse's hindquarters appeared just above the faces of any speakers. Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush Administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq.[3] In a critique of the covering, columnist Alejandro Escalona hypothesized that Guernica's unappealing ménage of mutilated bodies and distorted faces proved to be too strong for articulating to the world why the US was going to war in Iraq, while referring to the work as an inconvenient masterpiece.[17]</p><p>On 17 March 2009, Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Marie Okabe announced that the Guernica tapestry had been moved to a gallery in London in advance of extensive renovations at UN Headquarters. The Guernica tapestry was the showcase piece for the grand reopening of the Whitechapel Gallery. It was located in the 'Guernica room' which was originally part of the old Whitechapel Library.[41] In 2012 the tapestry was on temporary loan to the San Antonio Museum of Art in San Antonio, Texas from the Rockefeller family.[42] It was returned to the UN by March 2015.[43]</p><h2>Significance and legacy</h2><p>Guernica is to painting what Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is to music: a cultural

		Kazimir Malevich, Suprematist Composition: White On White, 1918, Museum of Modern Art New York City


		</p><p>
			Monochromatic painting has been an important component of avant-garde visual art throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Painters have created the exploration of one color, the examination of values changing across a surface, the expressivity of texture and nuance, expressing a wide variety of emotions, intentions and meanings in a wide variety of ways and means.[1] From geometric precision to expressionism, the monochrome has proved to be a durable idiom in Contemporary art.[2]</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Origins</h2><p>Monochrome painting was initiated at the first Incoherent arts' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet Paul Bilhaud entitled Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel (Negroes fight in a tunnel). (Although Bilhaud was not the first to create an all-black artwork: for example, Robert Fludd published an image of Darkness in his 1617 book on the origin and structure of the cosmos; and Bertall published his black Vue de La Hogue (effet de nuit) in 1843.) In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer Alphonse Allais proposed other monochrome paintings, such as Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige (First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow, white), or Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge (Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea, red). Allais published his Album primo-avrilesque in 1897, a monograph with seven monochrome artworks. However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century Dada, or Neo-Dada, and particularly the works of the Fluxus group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.</p><p>Jean Metzinger, following the Succès de scandale created from the Cubist showing at the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, in an interview with Cyril Berger published in Paris-Journal 29 May 1911, stated:</p><p>We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)[3][4]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Metzinger's (then) audacious prediction that artists would take abstraction to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the primordial white unity, a completely white canvas would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto entitled Manifeste de l'école amorphiste, published in Les Hommes du Jour (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.[4][5][6] With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, Vers Amorphisme may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity.[7]</p><p>In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the geometric abstractions of painters associated with the Bauhaus, in the works of Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian and other artists associated with the De Stijl movement, and the Russian Constructivist movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncu?i.[8][9] Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Josef Albers, and the works of artists as diverse as Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Giorgio Morandi, and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of Abstract Expressionism that had been dominant in the New York School during the 1940s and 1950s.[10]</p><p>The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting high modernism, or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of aesthetic and sociopolitical upheavals.[11]</p><h3>Suprematism and Constructivism</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%81%D1%83%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82._1915._%D0%93%D0%A2%D0%93.png/220px-%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%81%D1%83%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82._1915._%D0%93%D0%A2%D0%93.png" width="220" height="221"><p>


		Kazimir Malevich, Black Square, 1915, oil on canvas, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow[12]


		</p><p>
			Monochrome painting as it is usually understood today began in Moscow, with Suprematist Composition: White on White [13] of 1918 by Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich. This was a variation on or sequel to his 1915 work “Black Square on a White Field”, a very important work in its own right to 20th century geometric abstraction.</p><p>In 1921, Constructivist artist Alexander Rodchenko exhibited three paintings together, each a monochrome of one of the three primary colours. He intended this work to represent The Death of Painting.[14]</p><p>While Rodchenko intended his monochrome to be a dismantling of the typical assumptions of painting, Malevich saw his work as a concentration on them, a kind of meditation on art’s essence (“pure feeling”).</p><p>These two approaches articulated very early on in its history this kind of work’s almost paradoxical dynamic: that one can read a monochrome either as a flat surface (material entity or “painting as object”) which represents nothing but itself, and therefore representing an ending in the evolution of illusionism in painting (i.e. Rodchenko); or as a depiction of multidimensional (infinite) space, a fulfillment of illusionistic painting, representing a new evolution—a new beginning—in Western painting’s history (Malevich). Additionally, many have pointed out that it may be difficult to deduce the artist’s intentions from the painting itself, without referring to the artist’s comment.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Artists</h2><h3>New York</h3><h3>Abstract Expressionists</h3><p> Main article: Abstract Expressionism</p><p>(January 7, 1917 Bratslav, Rodolia, Ukraine - March 12, 2004 New York, New York, USA) had a long career as an Abstract Expressionist painter. Initially, during the 1940s, he explored the then-current style of Action Painting. His later work, from the 1950s through the 1970s is often characterized as Abstract Impressionist - largely because he constructed his allover compositions with multiple, repetitive, and close-valued brushstrokes, in the manner of Claude Monet in the famous Waterlilies series. During the final two and a half decades of his painting career Resnick's paintings became monochromatic, albeit with thickly brushed and layered surfaces.</p><p>(1913 Buffalo, New York, USA - 1967 New York, New York, USA) was an Abstract Expressionist artist notable for painting nearly “pure” monochromes over a considerable span of time (roughly from 1952 to his death in 1967), in red or blue, and lastly and most (in)famously, in black. Like the Johns works mentioned below, Reinhardt’s black paintings contained faint indications of geometrical shape, but the actual dilineations are not readily visible until the viewer spends time with the work. This tends to encourage a state of contemplative meditation in the viewer, and to create uncertainty about perception; in terms of Frank Stella's famous quote, you may question whether what you see is actually what you are seeing.[15]</p><p>Although Pousette-Dart (1916 Saint-Paul, Minnesota, USA - 1992 Suffern, New York, USA) created several distinct series of paintings during his long career as an Abstract Expressionist painter, his monochromatic series called Presences spanning the late 1950s through the early 1990s, was among his most powerful.</p><h3>Color field</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Voice_of_Fire_photo.jpg/170px-Voice_of_Fire_photo.jpg" width="170" height="380"><p>

In the White Paintings (1951) series, Rauschenberg applied everyday house paint with paint rollers to achieve smooth blank surfaces. White panels were exhibited alone or in modular groupings. The Black Paintings (1951–53) incorporated texture under the painted surface by way of collaged newspaper that sometimes indicates a grid-like structure. The Red Paintings (1953–54) incorporate still more materials such as wood and fabric under the heavily worked painted surface, and seem to foreshadow Rauschenberg's development of assemblage in his Combine Paintings as well as his stated intention to act in the gap between Art and Life.</p><p>(born 1930, Augusta, Georgia, USA) was a friend of Rauschenberg, and both were often categorized as Neo-Dadaist, pointing to their rejection of the Abstract Expressionist aesthetic which was dominant in the 1950s.

		</p><p>
			(born 1938, Bronxville, New York, USA) in his earliest mature works explored a reductive strategy which seemed similar to that of Jasper Johns’s and Ellsworth Kelly's contemporaneous works, yet more formalist: paintings such as Return 1 consist of subtly grey fields painted in encaustic (wax-medium) with a narrow strip along the bottom of the canvas where Marden left bare evidence of process (i.e., drips and spatters of paint). During the late 1980s Brice Marden, who held a spiritual/emotional view of abstraction, began a more multi-colored and calligraphic form of abstract painting.</p><p>(born 1936, Malden, Massachusetts, USA) echoed composer Igor Stravinsky’s famous assertion that “music is powerless to express anything but itself” when he said “What you see is what you see,” a remark he later qualified by saying his early paintings were influenced to a degree by the writing of Samuel Beckett (see above). In his work he was attempting to minimize any inference of “spiritual” or even “emotional” response on the part of the viewer, and this is perhaps most striking in his pinstripe Black Paintings (Marriage of Reason and Squalor - detail - 1959) beginning in the late ’50s, where the pinstripes are articulated by unpainted canvas. Later, Stella abandoned not only monochrome, but also eventually geometric painting.</p><p>(born 1934, Berkeley, California, USA) is characteristically Minimalist in that his objects aren't adequately categorized as painting or sculpture. Famous since 1965 for slabs, columns, planks ... Neutral forms, his meticulously finished, polished monochrome objects are often simply leaned up against gallery walls, in what some critics describe as a casual West Coast-lean. Although he draws from techniques characteristic of surfboard manufacture, his works are personally and meticulously handcrafted, unlike those of John M. Miller and other more recent artists, which are typically factory-made according to the artist's specifications.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Mccollum_100ps.jpeg/220px-Mccollum_100ps.jpeg" width="220" height="162"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Allan McCollum, Collection of One Hundred Plaster Surrogates, 1982/1990, Enamel on cast Hydrostone. Collection: Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst Antwerp, Belgium


		 
		</p><p>
			(born 1944, Los Angeles, California, USA) determined in the mid-1970s that the social forces that give paintings meaning may be better understood if the painting itself could be reduced to a generic form—a painting that could read as a sign for a painting, which could function of a placeholder, or a kind of prop. In the 1970s and early 80s he painted what he called Surrogate Paintings, and ultimately began casting them in plaster, frame and all. These hundreds of objects that looked like framed, matted, fields of painted blackness, worked as neutral, generic signs that might inspire the viewer to think about the social expectations that constructed the idea of a painting, more than the actual painting itself. By reducing paintings to mere signs of themselves, McCollum turned the gallery and the museum setting into a kind of theater, highlighting the drama of presenting, displaying, buying and selling, exchanging, photographing, assessing, criticising, choosing, and writing about the works; the object-paintings at the center of the action were purposely rendered moot, in order to turn one's attention to the supplementary devices and social practices that, in the end, bestow the value on the work.

		Yves Klein, IKB 191, 1962.


		</p><p>
			Although Klein had painted monochromes as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950, his first public showing was the publication of the Artist's book Yves: Peintures in November 1954. Parodying a traditional catalogue, the book featured a series of intense monochromes linked to various cities he had lived in during the previous years. Yves: Peintures anticipated his first two shows of oil paintings, at the Club des Solitaires, Paris, October 1955 and Yves: Proposition monochromes at Gallery Colette Allendy, February 1956. These shows, displaying orange, yellow, red, pink and blue monochromes, deeply disappointed Klein, as people went from painting to painting, linking them together as a sort of mosaic.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From the reactions of the audience, [Klein] realized that...viewers thought his various, uniformly colored canvases amounted to a new kind of bright, abstract interior decoration. Shocked at this misunderstanding, Klein knew a further and decisive step in the direction of monochrome art would have to be taken...From that time onwards he would concentrate on one single, primary color alone: blue. Hannah Weitemeier[19]</p><p>The next exhibition, 'Proposte Monochrome, Epoca Blu' (Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch) at the Gallery Apollinaire, Milan, (January 1957), featured 11 identical blue canvases, using ultramarine pigment suspended in a synthetic resin 'Rhodopas'. Discovered with the help of Edouard Adam, a Parisian paint dealer, the effect was to retain the brilliance of the pigment which tended to become dull when suspended in linseed oil. Klein later patented this recipe to maintain the authenticity of the pure idea.[20] This colour, reminiscent of the lapis lazuli used to paint the Madonna's robes in medieval paintings, was to become famous as 'International Klein Blue' (IKB). The paintings were attached to poles placed 20&nbsp;cm away from the walls to increase their spatial ambiguities.</p><p>The show was a critical and commercial success, traveling to Paris, Düsseldorf and London. The Parisian exhibition, at the Iris Clert Gallery, May 1957, became a seminal happening;[21] As well as 1001 blue balloons being released to mark the opening, blue postcards were sent out using IKB stamps that Klein had bribed the postal service to accept as legitimate.[22] An exhibition of tubs of blue pigment and fire paintings was held concurrently at Gallery Collette Allendy.</p><p>(born 1932, Dresden, Germany) is an artist who is probably best known for his technically stunning photo-realist paintings, which overshadow his abstract and monochrome works. Both his abstract and representational works seem to cover similar emotional terrain, a kind of ironic pessimism which made his work very fashionable in the late 1980s. His grey paintings, are made by drawing “expressive” gestures in wet paint.</p><p>(born 1944, Bern, Switzerland) also has spent considerable time in New York and Paris. In Paris in the 1960s he was a member of the BMPT group, along with Daniel Buren, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni. The group brought forth questions about the notions of authorship and originality, implying that they often did each other's works, and that the art object was more important than its authorship. Later, in New York in the late 1970s, Mosset undertook a long series of monochrome paintings, during the heyday of Neo-expressionism. He became a founding member of the New York Radical Painting group, radical referring both to an implied radical social stance, as well as a returning to the radical “root” of painting. This re-assertion of social relevance for abstraction, and even the monochrome, hadn’t been emphasized to such a degree since Malevich and Rodchenko. 1980s neo-geo artists such as Peter Halley who assert a socially relevant, critical role for geometric abstraction, cite Mosset as an influence.

		</p><p>
			The crucifixion of Jesus occurred in 1st century Judea, most probably between the years 30 and 33 AD. Jesus' crucifixion is described in the four canonical gospels, referred to in the New Testament epistles, attested to by other ancient sources, and is established as a historical event confirmed by non-Christian sources,[1] although, among historians, there is no consensus on the precise details of what exactly occurred.[2][3][4]</p><p>According to the canonical gospels, Jesus, the Christ, was arrested, tried, and sentenced by Pontius Pilate to be scourged, and finally crucified by the Romans.[5][6][7][8] Jesus was stripped of his clothing and offered wine mixed with gall to drink, before being crucified. He was then hung between two convicted thieves and according to Mark's Gospel, died some six hours later. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews in three languages. They then divided his garments among them, but cast lots for his seamless robe. After Jesus' death they pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died. The Bible describes seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several supernatural events that occurred.</p><p>Collectively referred to as the Passion, Jesus' suffering and redemptive death by crucifixion are the central aspects of Christian theology concerning the doctrines of salvation and atonement.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Historicity</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Hortus_Deliciarum%2C_Die_Kreuzigung_Jesu_Christi.JPG/220px-Hortus_Deliciarum%2C_Die_Kreuzigung_Jesu_Christi.JPG" width="220" height="167"><p>

			The baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be two historically certain facts about Jesus.[9][10] James Dunn states that these two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent and rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.[9] Bart Ehrman states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of Pontius Pilate is the most certain element about him.[11] John Dominic Crossan states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be.[12] Eddy and Boyd state that it is now firmly established that there is non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.[13] Craig Blomberg states that most scholars in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable.[4] Christopher M. Tuckett states that, although the exact reasons for the death of Jesus are hard to determine, one of the indisputable facts about him is that he was crucified.[14]</p><p>While scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it. For example, both E. P. Sanders and Paula Fredriksen support the historicity of the crucifixion but contend that Jesus did not foretell his own crucifixion and that his prediction of the crucifixion is a church creation (p.&nbsp;126).[15] Geza Vermes also views the crucifixion as a historical event but provides his own explanation and background for it.[15]</p><p>John P. Meier views the crucifixion of Jesus as historical fact and states that, based on the criterion of embarrassment, Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.[16] Meier states that a number of other criteria, e.g., the criterion of multiple attestation (i.e., confirmation by more than one source) and the criterion of coherence (i.e., that it fits with other historical elements) help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event.[17]</p><p>Although almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary, the 1968 archeological discovery just northeast of Jerusalem of the body of a crucified man dated to the 1st century provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the Roman period roughly according to the manner in which the crucifixion of Jesus is described in the gospels.[18] The crucified man was identified as Yehohanan ben Hagkol and probably died about 70 AD, around the time of the Jewish revolt against Rome. The analyses at the Hadassah Medical School estimated that he died in his late 20s. Another relevant archaeological find, which also dates to the 1st century AD, is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite, now held by the Israel Antiquities Authority and displayed in the Israel Museum.[19][20]</p><h2>New Testament narrative</h2><p>The earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels. There are other, more implicit references in the New Testament epistles. In the synoptic gospels, Jesus predicts his death in three separate episodes.[21] All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of Jesus' arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and accounts of resurrection. In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening.[22]:p.91</p><p>Combining statements in the canonical Gospels produces the following account: Jesus was arrested in Gethsemane following the Last Supper with the Twelve Apostles, and then stood trial before the Sanhedrin (a Jewish judicial body), Pontius Pilate (a Roman authority in Judaea), and Herod Antipas (king of Judea, appointed by Rome), before being handed over for crucifixion by the chief priests of the Jews.[23] After being flogged, Jesus was mocked by Roman soldiers as the King of the Jews, clothed in a purple robe, crowned with thorns, beaten and spat on. Jesus then had to make his way to the place of his crucifixion.</p><p>Once at Golgotha, Jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink. Matthew's and Mark's Gospels record that he refused this. He was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves. According to some translations from the original Greek, the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels.[24] According to Mark's Gospel, he endured the torment of crucifixion for some six hours from the third hour, at approximately 9 am,[25] until his death at the ninth hour, corresponding to about 3 pm.[26] The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews in three languages, divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe. The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as they did to the other two men crucified (breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process), as Jesus was dead already. Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, seven statements altogether.[27] In the Synoptic Gospels, various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion, including darkness, an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints. Following Jesus' death, his body was removed from the cross by Joseph of Arimathea and buried in a rock-hewn tomb, with Nicodemus assisting.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/The_Crucifixion_Christ_on_the_Cross_between_two_thieves_%28f._80%29_Cropped.jpg/220px-The_Crucifixion_Christ_on_the_Cross_between_two_thieves_%28f._80%29_Cropped.jpg" width="220" height="282"><p>

			According to all four gospels, Jesus was brought to the Place of a Skull[28] and crucified with two thieves,[29] with the charge of claiming to be King of the Jews,[30] and the soldiers divided his clothes[31] before he bowed his head and died.[32] Following his death, Joseph of Arimathea requested the body from Pilate,[33] which Joseph then placed in a new garden tomb.[34]</p><p>The three Synoptic gospels also describe Simon of Cyrene bearing the cross,[35] the multitude mocking Jesus[36] along with the thieves/robbers/rebels,[37] darkness from the 6th to the 9th hour,[38] and the temple veil being torn from top to bottom.[39] The Synoptics also mention several witnesses, including a centurion,[40] and several women who watched from a distance[41] two of whom were present during the burial.[42]</p><p>Luke is the only gospel writer to omit the detail of sour wine mix that was offered to Jesus on a reed,[43] while only Mark and John describe Joseph actually taking the body down off the cross.[44]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>There are several details that are only found in one of the gospel accounts. For instance, only Matthew's gospel mentions an earthquake, resurrected saints who went to the city and that Roman soldiers were assigned to guard the tomb,[45] while Mark is the only one to state the actual time of the crucifixion (the third hour, or 9&nbsp;am) and the centurion's report of Jesus' death.[46] The Gospel of Luke's unique contributions to the narrative include Jesus' words to the women who were mourning, one criminal's rebuke of the other, the reaction of the multitudes who left beating their breasts, and the women preparing spices and ointments before resting on the Sabbath.[47] John is also the only one to refer to the request that the legs be broken and the soldier's subsequent piercing of Jesus' side (as fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy), as well as that Nicodemus assisted Joseph with burial.[48]</p><p>According to the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 15:4), Jesus was raised from the dead (on the third day counting the day of crucifixion as the first) and according to the canonical Gospels, appeared to his disciples on different occasions before ascending to heaven.[49] The account given in Acts of the Apostles, which says Jesus remained with the apostles for forty days, appears to differ from the account in the Gospel of Luke, which makes no clear distinction between the events of Easter Sunday and the Ascension.[50][51] However, most biblical scholars agree that St. Luke also wrote the Acts of the Apostles as a follow-up volume to his Gospel account, and the two works must be considered as a whole.[52]</p><p>In Mark, Jesus is crucified along with two rebels, and the day goes dark for three hours.[53] Jesus calls out to God, then gives a shout and dies.[53] The curtain of the Temple is torn in two.[53] Matthew follows Mark, adding an earthquake and the resurrection of saints.[54] Luke also follows Mark, though he describes the rebels as common criminals, one of whom defends Jesus, who in turn promises that he (Jesus) and the criminal will be together in paradise.[55] Luke portrays Jesus as impassive in the face of his crucifixion.[56] John includes several of the same elements as those found in Mark, though they are treated differently.[57]</p><h2>Other accounts and references</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Buhl_StJeanBaptiste27.JPG/220px-Buhl_StJeanBaptiste27.JPG" width="220" height="165"><p>

			An early non-Christian reference to the crucifixion of Jesus is likely to be Mara Bar-Serapion's letter to his son, written sometime after AD 73 but before the 3rd century AD.[58][5][59] The letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be a pagan.[58][5][60] The letter refers to the retributions that followed the unjust treatment of three wise men: Socrates, Pythagoras, and the wise king of the Jews.[58][59] Some scholars see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the king of the Jews is about the crucifixion of Jesus, while others place less value in the letter, given the possible ambiguity in the reference.[60][61]</p><p>In the Antiquities of the Jews (written about 93 AD) Jewish historian Josephus, stated (Ant 18.3) that Jesus was crucified by Pilate, writing that:[62]</p><p>Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man,&nbsp;... He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles&nbsp;... And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross&nbsp;...</p><p>Most modern scholars agree that while this Josephus passage (called the Testimonium Flavianum) includes some later interpolations, it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate.[6][7][8] James Dunn states that there is broad consensus among scholars regarding the nature of an authentic reference to the crucifixion of Jesus in the Testimonium.[63]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Early in the second century another reference to the crucifixion of Jesus was made by Tacitus, generally considered one of the greatest Roman historians.[64][65] Writing in The Annals (c. 116 AD), Tacitus described the persecution of Christians by Nero and stated (Annals 15.44) that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus:[62][66]</p><p>Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus.</p><p>Scholars generally consider the Tacitus reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate to be genuine, and of historical value as an independent Roman source.[64][67][68][69][70][71] Eddy and Boyd state that it is now firmly established that Tacitus provides a non-Christian confirmation of the crucifixion of Jesus.[13]</p><p>Another possible reference to the crucifixion (hanging cf. Luke 23:39; Galatians 3:13) is found in the Babylonian Talmud:</p><p>On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, 'He is going forth to be stoned because he has practised sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy. Anyone who can say anything in his favour, let him come forward and plead on his behalf.' But since nothing was brought forward in his favour he was hanged on the eve of the Passover!</p><p>Although the question of the equivalence of the identities of Yeshu and Jesus has at times been debated, many historians agree that the above 2nd-century passage is likely to be about Jesus, Peter Schäfer stating that there can be no doubt that this narrative of the execution in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth.[72] Robert Van Voorst states that the Sanhedrin 43a reference to Jesus can be confirmed not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it.[73]</p><p>Muslims maintain that Jesus was not crucified and that those who thought they had killed him had mistakenly killed Judas Iscariot, Simon of Cyrene, or someone else in his place.[74] They hold this belief based on various interpretations of Quran&nbsp;4:157–158, which states: they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them [or it appeared so unto them],&nbsp;... Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself.[74]</p><p>Some early Christian Gnostic sects, believing Jesus did not have a physical substance, denied that he was crucified.[75][76] In response, Ignatius of Antioch insisted that Jesus was truly born and was truly crucified and wrote that those who held that Jesus only seemed to suffer only seemed to be Christians.[77][78]</p><h2>The Crucifixion</h2><p> Main article: Passion (Christianity)</p><h3>Chronology</h3><p> Main article: Chronology of Jesus</p><p>There is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a Friday on or near Passover (Nisan 15), during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (who ruled AD 26–36).[79] Scholars have provided estimates for the year of crucifixion in the range 30–33 AD,[80][81][82] with Rainer Riesner stating that the fourteenth of Nisan (7 April) of the year a.d. 30 is, apparently in the opinion of the majority of contemporary scholars as well, far and away the most likely date of the crucifixion of Jesus.[83] Another popular date is Friday, April 3, 33 AD.[84][85]</p><p>Since an observational calendar was used during the time of Jesus, including an ascertainment of the new moon and ripening barley harvest, the exact day or even month for Passover in a given year is subject to speculation.[86][87][not in citation given]. Various approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion, including the canonical Gospels, the chronology of the life of Paul, as well as different astronomical models.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The consensus of modern scholarship is that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, but a Thursday or Wednesday crucifixion have also been proposed.[88][89] Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion based on a double sabbath caused by an extra Passover sabbath falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon, ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath.[88][90] Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday, not Friday, on the grounds of the mention of three days and three nights in Matthew before his resurrection, celebrated on Sunday. Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a day and night may refer to any part of a 24-hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights.[88][91]</p><p>In Mark 15:25 crucifixion takes place at the third hour (9 a.m.) and Jesus' death at the ninth hour (3 p.m.).[92] However, in John 19:14 Jesus is still before Pilate at the sixth hour.[93] Scholars have presented a number of arguments to deal with the issue, some suggesting a reconciliation, e.g., based on the use of Roman timekeeping in John but not in Mark, yet others have rejected the arguments.[93][94][95] Several scholars have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available, and time was often approximated to the closest three-hour period.[93][96][97]</p><h3>Path to the crucifixion</h3><p> Main articles: Christ carrying the Cross and Via Dolorosa</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/5_Andrea_di_Bartolo._Way_to_Calvary._c._1400%2C_Thissen-Bornhemisza_coll._Madrid.jpg/220px-5_Andrea_di_Bartolo._Way_to_Calvary._c._1400%2C_Thissen-Bornhemisza_coll._Madrid.jpg" width="220" height="247"><p>

			The three Synoptic Gospels refer to a man called Simon of Cyrene who is made to carry the cross,[98] while in the Gospel of John, Jesus is said to bear his own cross.[Jn. 19:17]</p><p>Luke's gospel also describes an interaction between Jesus and the women among the crowd of mourners following him, quoting Jesus as saying Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'

			The precise location of the crucifixion remains a matter of conjecture, but the biblical accounts indicate that it was outside the city walls of Jerusalem,[Jn. 19:20] [Heb. 13:12] accessible to passers-by[Mt. 27:39] [Mk. 15:21,29-30] and observable from some distance away.[Mk. 15:40] Eusebius identified its location only as being north of Mount Zion,[105] which is consistent with the two most popularly suggested sites of modern times.</p><p>Calvary as an English name for the place is derived from the Latin word for skull (calvaria), which is used in the Vulgate translation of place of a skull, the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word Gûlgaltâ which was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified.[106] The text does not indicate why it was so designated, but several theories have been put forward. One is that as a place of public execution, Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims (which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions, but not Roman). Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites). A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of a skull. While often referred to as Mount Calvary, it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll.[107]</p><p>The traditional site, inside what is now occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Christian Quarter of the Old City, has been attested since the 4th century. A second site (commonly referred to as Gordon's Calvary[108] ), located further north of the Old City near a place popularly called the Garden Tomb, has been promoted since the 19th century.</p><h3>People present</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Aveiro_March_2012-1a.jpg/280px-Aveiro_March_2012-1a.jpg" width="280" height="155"><p>

			The Gospel of Matthew describes many women at the crucifixion, some of whom are named in the Gospels.

			Whereas most Christians believe the gibbet on which Jesus was executed was the traditional two-beamed cross, the Jehovah's Witnesses hold the view that a single upright stake was used. The Greek and Latin words used in the earliest Christian writings are ambiguous. The Koine Greek terms used in the New Testament are stauros (sta????) and xylon (?????). The latter means wood (a live tree, timber or an object constructed of wood); in earlier forms of Greek, the former term meant an upright stake or pole, but in Koine Greek it was used also to mean a cross.[122] The Latin word crux was also applied to objects other than a cross.[123]</p><p>However, early Christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135,[124] and may have been of the 1st century AD,[125] the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened it to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300),[126] and to the position assumed by Moses in Exodus 17:11–12.[127] Justin Martyr (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.[128] Irenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails.[129]</p><p>The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails.[130] However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails.[131] These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion.[132] In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other.[132] Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross.[132] The tradition also carries to Christian emblems, e.g. the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.[133]</p><p>The placing of the nails in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain. Some theories suggest that the Greek word cheir (?e??) for hand includes the wrist and that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through Destot's space (between the capitate and lunate bones) without fracturing any bones.[134] Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm.[135] Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails.[136]</p><p>Another issue has been the use of a hypopodium as a standing platform to support the feet, given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight. In the 17th century Rasmus Bartholin considered a number of analytical scenarios of that topic.[131] In the 20th century, forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe performed a number of crucifixion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions.[135] His experiments support an angled suspension, and a two-beamed cross, and perhaps some form of foot support, given that in an Aufbinden form of suspension from a straight stake (as used by the Nazis in the Dachau concentration camp during World War II), death comes rather quickly.[137]</p><h3>Words of Jesus spoken from the cross</h3><p> Main article: Sayings of Jesus on the cross</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Brooklyn_Museum_-_What_Our_Lord_Saw_from_the_Cross_%28Ce_que_voyait_Notre-Seigneur_sur_la_Croix%29_-_James_Tissot.jpg/220px-Brooklyn_Museum_-_What_Our_Lord_Saw_from_the_Cross_%28Ce_que_voyait_Notre-Seigneur_sur_la_Croix%29_-_James_Tissot.jpg" width="220" height="238"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

			The New Testament gives three different accounts of the words of Jesus on the cross. In Mark and Matthew Jesus utters only one saying on the cross, while Luke and John each describe three statements unique to them.[138]</p><p>Mark / Matthew</p><p>The only words of Jesus on the cross in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of Psalm 22. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, it is often considered a literary and theological creation. Geza Vermes, however, points out that the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage.[139] Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers this phrase 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'.[140] He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'.[141] Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.[142]</p><p>Luke</p><p>The Gospel of Luke does not have the cry of Jesus found within Matthew and Mark, possibly playing down the suffering of Jesus and replacing a cry of desperation with one of hope and confidence, in keeping with the message of the Gospel which Jesus as dying confident that he would be vindicated as God's righteous prophet.[143]</p><p>John</p><p>The words of Jesus on the cross, especially his last words, have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ.[144][145][146][147][148][149] The difference between the accounts is cited by James Dunn as a reason to doubt their historicity.[150]</p><p>Just before His death on the cross, Jesus uttered a single word of victory: tetelestai “its finished”, The Greek words refer to something being finished, accomplished, completed, or coming to an end.[151]</p><h3>Reported extraordinary occurrences</h3><p>The synoptics report various miraculous events during the crucifixion.[152][153] Mark mentions darkness in the daytime during Jesus' crucifixion, and the Temple veil being torn in two when Jesus dies.[53] Luke follows Mark;[55] as does Matthew, adding an earthquake and the resurrection of dead saints.[54] No mention of any of these appears in John.[154]</p><p> Main article: Crucifixion darkness</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Christ_at_the_Cross_-_Cristo_en_la_Cruz.jpg/200px-Christ_at_the_Cross_-_Cristo_en_la_Cruz.jpg" width="200" height="243"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>


		Christ on the Cross, by Carl Heinrich Bloch, showing the skies darkened


		</p><p>
			In the synoptic narrative, while Jesus is hanging on the cross, the sky over Judea (or the whole world) is darkened for three hours, from the sixth to the ninth hour (noon to mid-afternoon). There is no reference to darkness in the Gospel of John account, in which the crucifixion does not take place until after noon.[155]</p><p>Some Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event, mistaking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the Passover, which takes place at the full moon. Christian traveller and historian Sextus Julius Africanus and Christian theologian Origen refer to Greek historian Phlegon, who lived in the 2nd century AD, as having written with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place[156]</p><p>Sextus Julius Africanus further refers to the writings of historian Thallus: This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun.[157] Christian apologist Tertullian believed the event was documented in the Roman archives.[158]</p><p>Colin Humphreys and W. G. Waddington of Oxford University considered the possibility that a lunar, rather than solar, eclipse might have taken place.[159][160] They concluded that such an eclipse would have been visible, for thirty minutes, from Jerusalem and suggested the gospel reference to a solar eclipse was the result of a scribe wrongly amending a text. Historian David Henige dismisses this explanation as 'indefensible'[161] and astronomer Bradley Schaefer points out that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours.[162][163]</p><p>Modern biblical scholarship treats the account in the synoptic gospels as a literary creation by the author of the Mark Gospel, amended in the Luke and Matthew accounts, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event, and not intended to be taken literally.[164] This image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers, a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as Philo, Dio Cassius, Virgil, Plutarch and Josephus.[165] Géza Vermes describes the darkness account as typical of Jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the Lord, and says that those interpreting it as a datable eclipse are barking up the wrong tree.[166]</p><p>The synoptic gospels state that the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom.</p><p>The Gospel of Matthew adds an account of earthquakes, splitting rocks, and the opening of the graves of dead saints - stock motifs from Jewish apocalyptic literature - and describes how these resurrected saints went into the holy city and appeared to many people.[167]</p><p>In the Mark and Matthew accounts, the centurion in charge comments on the events: Truly this man was the Son of God![Mk. 15:39] or Truly this was the Son of God!.[Mt. 27:54] In the Gospel of Luke this becomes, Certainly this man was innocent![Lk. 23:47]</p><p>A widespread 6.3 magnitude earthquake has been confirmed to have taken place between 26-36 AD in the time of Jesus.[168] The authors concluded that:</p><p>Plausible candidates include the earthquake reported in the Gospel of Matthew, an earthquake that occurred sometime before or after the crucifixion and was in effect ‘borrowed’ by the author of the Gospel of Matthew, and a local earthquake between 26 and 36 AD that was sufficiently energetic to deform the sediments at Ein Gedi but not energetic enough to produce a still extant and extra-biblical historical record. If the last possibility is true, this would mean that the report of an earthquake in the Gospel of Matthew is a type of allegory.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Medical aspects</h2><p>A number of theories to explain the circumstances of the death of Jesus on the cross have been proposed by physicians and Biblical scholars. In 2006, Matthew W Maslen and Piers D Mitchell reviewed over 40 publications on the subject with theories ranging from cardiac rupture to pulmonary embolism.[169]</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Deposition_of_Christ_C2RMF.jpg/180px-Deposition_of_Christ_C2RMF.jpg" width="180" height="276"><p>


		Bronzino's Deposition of Christ


		</p><p>
			In 1847, based on the reference in the Gospel of John (John 19:34) to blood and water coming out when the Jesus' side was pierced with a spear, physician William Stroud proposed the ruptured heart theory of the cause of Christ's death which influenced a number of other people.[170][171]</p><p>The cardiovascular collapse theory is a prevalent modern explanation and suggests that Jesus died of profound shock. According to this theory, the scourging, the beatings, and the fixing to the cross would have left Jesus dehydrated, weak, and critically ill and that this would have led to cardiovascular collapse.[172][173]</p><p>Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, physician William Edwards and his colleagues supported the combined cardiovascular collapse (via hypovolemic shock) and exhaustion asphyxia theories, assuming that the flow of water from the side of Jesus described in the Gospel of John[19:34] was pericardial fluid.[174]</p><p>In his book The Crucifixion of Jesus, physician and forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe studied the likely circumstances of the death of Jesus in great detail.[175][176] Zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner.[177] These studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured, in cases where the feet were also secured or not. In these cases the amount of pull and the corresponding pain was found to be significant.[177]</p><p>Pierre Barbet, a French physician, and the chief surgeon at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Paris,[178] hypothesized that Jesus would have had to relax his muscles to obtain enough air to utter his last words, in the face of exhaustion asphyxia.[179] Some of Barbet's theories, e.g., location of nails, are disputed by Zugibe.</p><p>Orthopedic surgeon Keith Maxwell not only analyzed the medical aspects of the crucifixion, but also looked back at how Jesus could have carried the cross all the way along Via Dolorosa.[180][181]</p><p>In an article for the Catholic Medical Association, Phillip Bishop and physiologist Brian Church suggested a new theory based on suspension trauma.[182]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>In 2003, historians FP Retief and L Cilliers reviewed the history and pathology of crucifixion as performed by the Romans and suggested that the cause of death was often a combination of factors. They also state that Roman guards were prohibited from leaving the scene until death had occurred.[183]</p><h2>Theological significance</h2><p>Christians believe that Jesus’ death was instrumental in restoring humankind to relationship with God.[184][185] Christians believe that through faith in Jesus’ substitutionary death and triumphant resurrection[186][187] people are reunited with God and receive new joy and power in this life as well as eternal life in heaven after the body’s death. Thus the crucifixion of Jesus along with his resurrection restores access to a vibrant experience of God’s presence, love and grace as well as the confidence of eternal life.[188]</p><h3>Christology of the crucifixion</h3><p>The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provide a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline epistles.[189] Christians believe Jesus' suffering was foretold in the Hebrew Bible, such as in Psalm 22, and Isaiah's songs of the suffering servant.[190]</p><p>In Johannine agent Christology the submission of Jesus to crucifixion is a sacrifice made as an agent of God or servant of God, for the sake of eventual victory.[191][192] This builds on the salvific theme of the Gospel of John which begins in John 1:29 with John the Baptist's proclamation: The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.[193][194] Further reinforcement of the concept is provided in Revelation 21:14 where the lamb slain but standing is the only one worthy of handling the scroll (i.e. the book) containing the names of those who are to be saved.[195]</p><p>A central element in the Christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan.[196] In this view, as in Acts 2:23, the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the lawless is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.[196][197]</p><p>Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term the cross of Christ used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.[198] For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in 1 Corinthians 2:8.[198] In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Philippians 2:8) died at the right time (Romans 4:25) based on the plan of God.[198] For Paul the power of the cross is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus.[198]</p><p>However, the belief in the redemptive nature of Jesus' death predates the Pauline letters and goes back to the earliest days of Christianity and the Jerusalem church.[199] The Nicene Creed's statement that for our sake he was crucified is a reflection of this core belief's formalization in the fourth century.[200]</p><p>John Calvin supported the agent of God Christology and argued that in his trial in Pilate's Court Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father.[201][202] This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the Eastern and Western Churches. In the Eastern Church Sergei Bulgakov argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was pre-eternally determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam.[203] In the Western Church, Karl Rahner elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water.[204]</p><h3>Atonement</h3><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p> Main articles: Atonement in Christianity and Salvation (Christianity)</p><p>Jesus' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words.[205] According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God.[206] By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom.[207] Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.[206]</p><p>In the Roman Catholic tradition this view of atonement is balanced by the duty of Roman Catholics to perform Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ[208] which in the encyclical Miserentissimus Redemptor of Pope Pius XI were defined as some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.[209] Pope John Paul II referred to these Acts of Reparation as the unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified.[210]</p><p>Among Eastern Orthodox Christians, another common view is Christus Victor.[211] This holds that Jesus was sent by God to defeat death and Satan. Because of his perfection, voluntary death, and resurrection, Jesus defeated Satan and death, and arose victorious. Therefore, humanity was no longer bound in sin, but was free to rejoin God through faith in Jesus.[212]</p><h2>Islam</h2><p> Main article: Islamic view of Jesus' death</p><p>Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir have elaborated an argument in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.</p><p>Professor and scholar Mahmoud M. Ayoub sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:</p><p>The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ. Rather, it challenges human beings who in their folly have deluded themselves into believing that they would vanquish the divine Word, Jesus Christ the Messenger of God. The death of Jesus is asserted several times and in various contexts. (3:55; 5:117; 19:33.)[213]</p><p>The Quranic verse in question which has been interpreted in various ways:</p><p>And they said we have killed the Messiah Isa son of Maryam, the Messenger of God. They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, though it was made to appear like that to them; those that disagreed about him are full of doubt, with no knowledge to follow, only supposition: they certainly did not kill him. On the contrary, God raised him unto himself. God is almighty and wise.</p><p>Contrary to Christian teachings, some Islamic traditions teach that Jesus ascended to Heaven without being put on the cross, but that God transformed another person to appear exactly like him and to be then crucified instead of him. This thought is supported in misreading an account by Irenaeus, the 2nd-century Alexandrian Gnostic Basilides when refuting a heresy denying the death.[215] Islamic tradition then picks up alongside the Christian testimony with Isa ascending bodily to Heaven, there to remain until his Second Coming in the End Days.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>In art, symbolism and devotions</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Detalle_crucificado_Luj%C3%A1n_P%C3%A9rez%2C_1793.jpg/200px-Detalle_crucificado_Luj%C3%A1n_P%C3%A9rez%2C_1793.jpg" width="200" height="150"><p>

			 Main article: Crucifixion in the arts</p><p>Since the crucifixion of Jesus, the cross has become a key element of Christian symbolism, and the crucifixion scene has been a key element of Christian art, giving rise to specific artistic themes such as Ecce Homo, The Raising of the Cross, Descent from the Cross and Entombment of Christ.</p><p>The Crucifixion, seen from the Cross by Tissot presented a novel approach at the end of the 19th century, in which the crucifixion scene was portrayed from the perspective of Jesus.[216][217]</p><p>The symbolism of the cross which is today one of the most widely recognized Christian symbols was used from the earliest Christian times and Justin Martyr who died in 165 describes it in a way that already implies its use as a symbol, although the crucifix appeared later.[218][219] Masters such as Caravaggio, Rubens and Titian have all depicted the Crucifixion scene in their works.</p><p>Devotions based on the process of crucifixion, and the sufferings of Jesus are followed by various Christians. The Stations of the Cross follows a number of stages based on the stages involved in the crucifixion of Jesus, while the Rosary of the Holy Wounds is used to meditate on the wounds of Jesus as part of the crucifixion .</p><p>The presence of the Virgin Mary under the cross[Jn. 19:26-27] has in itself been the subject of Marian art, and well known Catholic symbolism such as the Miraculous Medal and Pope John Paul II's Coat of Arms bearing a Marian Cross. And a number of Marian devotions also involve the presence of the Virgin Mary in Calvary, e.g., Pope John Paul II stated that Mary was united to Jesus on the Cross.[220][221] Well known works of Christian art by masters such as Raphael (e.g., the Mond Crucifixion), and Caravaggio (e.g., his Entombment) depict the Virgin Mary as part of the crucifixion scene.</p><p>Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crucifixion_of_Jesus&amp;oldid=783625286"

<div class="content"><p>Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: ?p?????, Apollon (GEN ?p???????); Doric: ?p?????, Apellon; Arcadocypriot: ?pe????, Apeilon; Aeolic: ?p????, Aploun; Latin: Apollo) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the kouros (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu.[1]</p><p>As the patron of Delphi (Pythian Apollo), Apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius, yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague. Amongst the god's custodial charges, Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks. As the leader of the Muses (Apollon Musegetes) and director of their choir, Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry. Hermes created the lyre for him, and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo. Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans.</p><p>In Hellenistic times, especially during the 3rd century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan god of the sun, and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene, Titan goddess of the moon.[2] In Latin texts, on the other hand, Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century, not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII (161–215).[3] Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE.</p><h2>Contents</h2><h2>Etymology</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/MANNapoli_6281_Sitting_Apollo_Farnese.jpg/220px-MANNapoli_6281_Sitting_Apollo_Farnese.jpg" width="220" height="328"><p>

			The name Apollo—unlike the related older name Paean—is generally not found in the Linear B (Mycenean Greek) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form ]pe-rjo-[ (Linear B: ]????????-[) on the KN E 842 tablet.[4][5][6]</p><p>The etymology of the name is uncertain. The spelling ?p????? (pronounced&nbsp;[a.pól.l??n] in Classical Attic) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form, Apellon (?p?????), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier *?p??j??. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios (?pe??a???),[7] and the offerings apellaia (?pe??a?a) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (?p???a?).[8][9] According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella (?p???a), which originally meant wall, fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square.[10][11] Apella (?p???a) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,[10] corresponding to the ecclesia (?????s?a). R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *Apalyun.[12]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb ?p????µ? (apollymi), to destroy.[13] Plato in Cratylus connects the name with ?p???s?? (apolysis), redemption, with ?p????s?? (apolousis), purification, and with ?p???? ([h]aploun), simple,[14] in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, ?p????, and finally with ?e?ß????? (aeiballon), ever-shooting. Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ?p???a (apella), which means assembly, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation s???? (sekos), fold, in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.[15] In the ancient Macedonian language p???a (pella) means stone,[16] and some toponyms may be derived from this word: ????a (Pella,[17] the capital of ancient Macedonia) and ?e????? (Pellene/Pallene).[18]</p><p>A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,[19] The Hittite form Apaliunas (dx-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš) is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter,[20] perhaps related to Hurrian (and certainly the Etruscan) Aplu, a god of plague, in turn likely from Akkadian Aplu Enlil meaning simply the son of Enlil, a title that was given to the god Nergal, who was linked to Shamash, Babylonian god of the sun.[21] The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of Apollo Smintheus (mouse Apollo) by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic, meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).</p><p>The Hittite testimony reflects an early form *Apeljon, which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot ?pe???? with Doric ?p?????.[22]</p><p>A Luwian etymology suggested for Apaliunas makes Apollo The One of Entrapment, perhaps in the sense of Hunter.[23]</p><h3>Greco-Roman epithets</h3><p>Apollo's chief epithet was Phoebus (/'fi?b?s/ FEE-b?s; F??ß??, Phoibos [p?ó?i.bos]), literally bright.[24] It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in Latin literature.</p><p>Apollo's birthplace was Mount Cynthus on the island of Delos.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Bassai_Temple_Of_Apollo_Detail.jpg/250px-Bassai_Temple_Of_Apollo_Detail.jpg" width="250" height="188"><p>

			Apollo was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire. In the traditionally Celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with Celtic gods of similar character.[38]</p><h2>Origins</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Omphalos_museum.jpg/250px-Omphalos_museum.jpg" width="250" height="333"><p>


		The Omphalos in the Museum of Delphi


		</p><p>
			The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of Pytho. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing. In classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.[47] Walter Burkert[48] discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>From his eastern origin Apollo brought the art of inspection of symbols and omina (s?µe?a ?a? t??ata&nbsp;: semeia kai terata), and of the observation of the omens of the days. The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from Anatolia. The ritualism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. The Greeks created the legalism, the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, the protector of music, spiritual-life, moderation and perceptible order. The improvement of the old Anatolian god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the Greek people.[49]</p><h3>Healer and god-protector from evil</h3><p>The function of Apollo as a healer is connected with Paean (?a???-?a????), the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, who seems to come from a more primitive religion.[50] Pae?n is probably connected with the Mycenean pa-ja-wo-ne (Linear B: ????????????????),[51][52][53] but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean (pa???). The magicians were also called seer-doctors (?at??µ??te??), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles.[54]</p><p>In the Iliad, Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra.[55] He sends a plague (???µ??) to the Achaeans. The god who sends a disease can also prevent it; therefore, when it stops, they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil. When the oath of his priest appeases, they pray and with a song they call their own god, the Paean.[56]</p><p>Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are paion (pa???, literally healer or helper)[57] epikourios (?p??????, help), oulios (????, healed wound, also a scar )[58] and loimios (???µ??, plague). In classical times, his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and was therefore called apotropaios (?p?t??p?, divert, deter, avert) and alexikakos (from v. ????? + n. ?a???, defend from evil).[59] In later writers, the word, usually spelled Paean, becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing.[60]</p><p>Homer illustrated Paeon the god, and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph.[citation needed] Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo, and afterwards to other gods: to Dionysus, to Apollo Helios, to Apollo's son Asclepius the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune, or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognised as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.</p><h3>Dorian origin</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Apollo-WaltersArt.jpg/220px-Apollo-WaltersArt.jpg" width="220" height="320"><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>

		</p><p>
			The connection with the Dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month Apellaios in northwest Greek calendars .[62] The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (Doric form:?p?????).[63] Apellaios is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the megistos kouros (the great Kouros).[64] However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian word pella (Pella), stone. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (Omphalos).[65][66] The Homeric hymn represents Apollo as a Northern intruder. His arrival must have occurred during the Dark Ages that followed the destruction of the Mycenaean civilization, and his conflict with Gaia (Mother Earth) was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent Python.[67]</p><p>The earth deity had power over the ghostly world, and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle.[68] The older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated. A female dragon named Delphyne (de?f??, womb),[69] and a male serpent Typhon (t?fe??, to smoke), the adversary of Zeus in the Titanomachy, who the narrators confused with Python.[70][71] Python was the good daemon (??a??? da?µ??) of the temple as it appears in Minoan religion,[72] but she was represented as a dragon, as often happens in Northern European folklore as well as in the East.[73]</p><p>Apollo and his sister Artemis can bring death with their arrows. The conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings, or magicians is common in Germanic and Norse mythology.[55] In Greek mythology Artemis was the leader (??eµ??, hegemon) of the nymphs, who had similar functions with the Nordic Elves.[74] The elf-shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves, but it was later attested denoting stone arrow-heads which were used by witches to harm people, and also for healing rituals.[75]</p><p>The Vedic Rudra has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called The Archer, and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva.[76] Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them, and his alternative Shiba is a healer physician god.[77] However the Indo-European component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.</p><h3>Minoan origin</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/AMI_-_Goldene_Doppelaxt.jpg/250px-AMI_-_Goldene_Doppelaxt.jpg" width="250" height="188"><p>


		Ornamented golden Minoan labrys

			It seems an oracular cult existed in Delphi from the Mycenaean ages.[78] In historical times, the priests of Delphi were called Labryaden, the double-axe men, which indicates Minoan origin. The double-axe, labrys, was the holy symbol of the Cretan labyrinth.[79][80] The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. Apollo Delphinios or Delphidios was a sea-god especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands.[81] Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan Mistress of the animals. In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the Mister of the animals, a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute. His original name is unknown, but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular Apollo, who stood by the virgin Mistress of the Animals, becoming her brother.[74]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The old oracles in Delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood, and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple. This led some scholars to the conclusion that Pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress Sibyl of Anatolian origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself.[82] However, the Greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies.[83]</p><p>Plato describes the priestesses of Delphi and Dodona as frenzied women, obsessed by mania (µa??a, frenzy), a Greek word he connected with mantis (µ??t??, prophet).[84] Frenzied women like Sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the Near East as Mari in the second millennium BC.[85] Although Crete had contacts with Mari from 2000 BC,[86] there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the Minoan and Mycenean ages. It is more probable that this art was introduced later from Anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to Delphi and dormant in several areas of Greece.[87]</p><h3>Anatolian origin</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Coin_of_Apollo_Agyieus.png" width="121" height="123"><p>A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.[7] The name of Apollo's mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain purification.[49]</p><p>A similar story is mentioned by Plutarch. He writes that the Cretan seer Epimenides purified Athens after the pollution brought by the Alcmeonidae, and that the seer's expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to Solon in his reform of the Athenian state.[88] The story indicates that Epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of Asia, and proves, together with the Homeric hymn, that Crete had a resisting religion up to historical times. It seems that these rituals were dormant in Greece, and they were reinforced when the Greeks migrated to Anatolia.</p><p>Homer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans, during the Trojan War. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to Appaliunas, a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.[89] The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo. The Greeks gave to him the name ????e?? agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil, and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.[90] However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.[91]</p><p>The Late Bronze Age (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) Hittite and Hurrian Aplu was a god of plague, invoked during plague years. Here we have an apotropaic situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning the son of, was a title given to the god Nergal, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash.[21] Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god (de???? ?e??) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.[92] In Iliad, his priest prays to Apollo Smintheus,[93] the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats.[31][94][95] All these functions, including the function of the healer-god Paean, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><h2>Oracular cult</h2><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Columns_of_the_Temple_of_Apollo_at_Delphi%2C_Greece.jpeg/250px-Columns_of_the_Temple_of_Apollo_at_Delphi%2C_Greece.jpeg" width="250" height="188"><p>

			Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: Delos and Delphi. In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.[96] Apollo's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period, and the frequency of theophoric names such as Apollodorus or Apollonios and cities named Apollonia testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Clarus pronounced the so-called theological oracles, in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity. In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. Julian the Apostate (359 - 61) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.[7]</p><h3>Oracular shrines</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Delos_lions.jpg/250px-Delos_lions.jpg" width="250" height="141"><p>

			Apollo had a famous oracle in Delphi, and other notable ones in Clarus and Branchidae. His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis, where he bore the toponymic epithet Abaeus (?p????? ?ßa???, Apollon Abaios), was important enough to be consulted by Croesus.[97] His oracular shrines include:</p><p>Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.</p><h2>Temples of Apollo</h2><p> Main articles: Ancient Greek temple and Roman temple</p><p>A lot of temples dedicated to Apollo were built in Greece and in the Greek colonies, and they show the spread of the cult of Apollo, and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form, and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, don't belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types, because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection.[99] From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were narrow to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed, some mathematical relations became necessary, in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things, there was the permanent principle of mathematics.[100]</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>The Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century B.C, but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn’t be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order gradually during the Hellenistic age, and under Rome.</p><p>The most important temples are:</p><h3>Greek temples</h3><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Apollotempel.gif/200px-Apollotempel.gif" width="200" height="90"><p>

			When Zeus' wife Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on terra firma. In her wanderings, Leto found the newly created floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island. She gave birth there and was accepted by the people, offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city. Afterwards, Zeus secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean.[15] This island later became sacred to Apollo.</p><p>It is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace, nine yards (8 m) long, of amber. Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo, or that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the seventh day (?ßd?µa?e???, hebdomagenes)[131] of the month Thargelion —according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.[15]</p><h3>Youth</h3><p>Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the chthonic dragon Python, which lived in Delphi beside the Castalian Spring. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies. Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world. To protect his mother, Apollo begged Hephaestus for a bow and arrows. After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi.[132] Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of Gaia.</p><div class="gradientback"></div></div><div class="content"><p>Hera then sent the giant Tityos to rape Leto. This time Apollo was aided by his sister Artemis in protecting their mother. During the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus.

			Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the Trojan War in retribution for Agamemnon's insult to Chryses, a priest of Apollo whose daughter Chryseis had been captured. He demanded her return, and the Achaeans complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles, which is the theme of the Iliad.</p><p>In the Iliad, when Diomedes injured Aeneas, Apollo rescued him. First, Aphrodite tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well. Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy.</p><p>Apollo aided Paris in the killing of Achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into Achilles' heel. One interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for Achilles' sacrilege in murdering Troilus, the god's own son by Hecuba, on the very altar of the god's own temple.</p><h3>Admetus</h3><p>When Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting Hippolytus from the dead (transgressing Themis by stealing Hades's subjects), Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.[133] Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor, due to the intercession of his mother, Leto. During this time he served as shepherd for King Admetus of Pherae in Thessaly. Admetus treated Apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on Admetus.</p><p>Apollo helped Admetus win Alcestis, the daughter of King Pelias and later convinced the Fates to let Admetus live past his time, if another took his place. But when it came time for Admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. Instead, Alcestis took his place, but Heracles managed to persuade Thanatos, the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.</p><br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Niobe_JacquesLouisDavid_1772_Dallas_Museum_of_Art.jpg/250px-Niobe_JacquesLouisDavid_1772_Dallas_Museum_of_Art.jpg" width="250" height="193"><div class="gradientback"></div></div>
